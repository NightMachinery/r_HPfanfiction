Everyone has their fanfic pet peeves: from annoying twin-speak, to "Ice Queen" Daphne Greengrass. But what if an 'okay' fanfic was written that subverted/inverted or just plain gotten rid of such tropes?

For example, twin-speak isn't a thing, and the Weasley Twins don't prank people at all -- rather, they prefer verbal and physical comedy. Additionally, Daphne is an incredibly bubbly and warm character, with a sense of humour similar to the fanon Weasley twins.

In contrast, there is another hypothetical fanfic: one that is well-written, i.e. great dialogue, amazing action etc., but /ridiculously/ cliche! As in, so cliche that you can 9/10 times see where the narrative is going. It might have everything from evil Weasleys, to the moustache-twirling evil Dumbledore.

Which fanfic would you prefer to read?

EDIT: By "okay" I mean like a 6 or 6.5 out of 10 fanfic.


** Well-written.

I thought I'd like reading "unique" fics, and was recommended a very surrealist fic called Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus linkffn(9911469). But I couldn't get into it because it does subversion for the sake of subversion, and I couldn't enjoy the characterization - the MC is supposed to be a genderflipped Master of Death Harry, but has literally nothing in common. The supporting character is Horcrux Voldemort, but is never referred to in the story as anything but Wizard Lenin.

It's too weird, and it doesn't help that the writing in the first half is bad because the author doesn't know how to punctuate. Convoluted, run-on sentences, Lemony Snicket-style segues and narration style, metaphysical and philosophical navel gazing.

I just couldn't get into it because I was expecting a Harry Potter-style adventure and this ain't it.

*** On the other hand. I'm obsessed with the fic, and am now reading the Naruto/ Star Wars based offshoot of it. Also I don't know if you got to the point where she get's to Hogwarts, but the fic becomes a lot more grounded as the character matures. And I think wizard Lenin acts as a great straight man to Lily's insanity.

  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.

** Well written all the way. I have read some stories that had fantastic ideas or a great premise, but the writing quality was just too poor to enjoy it. On the other side, I have read stories that made me roll my eyes at the cliches but I still continued to read because they were good enough that I enjoyed them anyway.

Robst is an example here. You know what the pairing will be, you know which characters are likely to be evil, you even know how the story will sound (the author does tend to overuse certain turns of phrase, though it gets better with the newer stories) but I still read them because they don't read like a 10 year old wrote it on a cell phone. (And because I have no problems with over the top Harry/Hermione stories)

** I've read so many fics now that it's getting difficult to find new ones worth reading, so I'll probably read both.

Some clichés are so bad that it doesn't matter if the writing is top notch. Lord everything with super-trunks with apartments and connected floos, Gringotts fixing /anything/ for money, and enough money to hire 100,000 mercenaries to eradicate every Death Eater in the universe, except he's too stupid to actually use the money for anything useful.

No thanks.

Good plot with average writing? Yes please, as long as the errors don't kill the suspension of disbelief or are so egregious that I'm thrown out of the story by sheer incompetence. Get all the names and spells right. No Hermoine, no Kreature, no "stupify", no "alohamora". Each incorrect spelling increases the chances that I leave the story with a flaming review.

Dial back, way way back, "Merlin" as an expletive. Go back to the books, count the words, and count the times "Merlin" is used as an expletive. Don't exceed that ratio. The same goes for "cub", "pup", "prongslet", "furry little problem", and other "cute" stuff. Stay within the ratio of the original books, or else bad review.

** To me the cliches don't match up with good writing. No matter what flowery language you use to describe Harry receiving his inheritance and lord titles at Gringotts, it's not interesting for the main character to deal with conflicts by just smirking and saying "I have more lord titles, lawyers, and money than you, so you have no power over me".

At least the okay, very different fic might have a plot that interests me, and characters that I might like.

As long as there isn't many glaring grammar mistakes in which the author doesn't bother to edit, I don't mind.

** For me, it's always a mix, and I'm not crazy about either extreme. Bad writing makes it impossible for me to enjoy a creative idea, but fantastic writing with horrible cliches and plot also makes me pull out my hair. For the middle ground, the better one of the two is, the more I'm willing to tolerate lower quality on the other component. The absolute deal-breaker for me is bad writing, though, because it almost physically hurts to try and read it.

** I'd go for well-written 10/10. In my experience ideas are easy. I myself have had plenty of ideas for fics, and I think some are pretty good, but with the process of actually putting pen to paper and writing those ideas down I suddenly realize just how hard it is, and see just how much my mediocre writing can tank a good or even great idea.

So yeah, at this point I'm willing to read anything that is well-written and plotted. Any ship, any level of violence, fluff or angst, smut or chaste. Just give me something that is written well. :)

And preferably I'd love to read an author who doesn't succumb to story bloat and writes 300k words about a single school year (or worse, a single summer). I guess that's what I mean by plotting.
