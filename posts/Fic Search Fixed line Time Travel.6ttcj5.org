I'm searching for fixed line time travel fics. Where harry (or other) gets sent back in time, either by their future self or an accident.\\
For example,\\
thousand or more years: Basilisk-born and A Long Journey Home linkffn(10709411;9860311).\\
40-20 years: Turning of the Times and Retrograde linkffn(12416352;12021543).\\
ten years: HP: Dolen Amser linkffn(8772113)\\
Thanks


** Someone recently rec'd linkffn(Wind Shear) to me and I was quite pleased with it. Semi-similar to linkffn(Delenda Est) but I preferred Wind Shear (and technically DE isn't fixed if you count the sequel I think)

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

  After looking into Snape's pensieve, Harry makes up his mind to take charge of his actions. Before he can do that, he is sent back in time to 1975. He must find his own way back to the future without upsetting the timeline - but the Dark Lord is on the rise, and Harry's never been good at keeping his head down.
