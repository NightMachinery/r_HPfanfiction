** Honestly, Harry should have got an Order of Merlin First Class for every book.

Edit: Lily should also have gotten a posthumous one for taking out Voldie the first time, and James at least a Second Class for trying to attack Voldemort bare handed to protect his family. Didn't work, but the man had guts.

Competent Ministry. Lily gets full credit for destroying Voldemort, James partial credit. Whole story takes like, a month so Harry's still a toddler, no Order of Merlins for him.

  What if adults acted like adults? If they take responsibility, don't get distracted by revenge, build capable governments, and don't try to hold three full time vitally important jobs at the same time: result? Shit gets done. Sirius raises Harry; Dumbledore is awesome; the Blacks are possibly awesomer; the Ministry is functional, and Lupin gets a very interesting job.
