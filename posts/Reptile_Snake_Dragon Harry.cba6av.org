What recommendations do you guys have for stories like this? I've always liked reptiles and it's kinda hard to find among the massive pile of stories out there! Not to be picky as well, but if the fanfic is complete or is still being updated that would be awesome!


** Good lord, it took me forever to find this thing again, I couldn't for the life of me remember what it was called or where I read it.[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5786099/1/Cold-blood]]

THE Dragon!Harry fic, IMO.

​

100% Complete.

**** Without spoiling too much... (And going off what little I remember)

There used to be an old ritual to create dragon knights as powerful guardians of the realm. It was eventually stopped due to the high death count, as there was only a very slim chance of surviving it, and you had to be a powerful mage to begin with.

Venom of a basilisk, bone of the mage, scale of the dragon.

Harry's bit by a basilisk at 12. Fights a dragon at 14. His luck is /ridiculous/.

Accidental dragon knight in a world that doesn't (Or, really, /just barely/) remembers what those are.

Harry/Hermione ship, still mostly follows canon, has intelligent Voldemort, and well-written fight scenes.

***** Alrighty, I might give it a nibble then.

Actually, if it's Harry/Hermione, how does the story handle Ron? Is he a wisecracking observer or partner with his brothers in pranking or just a sounding board or...? It doesn't delve into Ron-bashing, does it?

****** It's during Fourth year and so Ron is a pretty big prat for the first half of the story. He eventually grows up but doesn't stay as a main character. Neville more or less takes his place as the third in the Golden Trio, which, while I'm not /happy/ about it, is pretty par for the course for Harry/Hermione stories.

** linkffn(10641167) HP x Percy Jackson. Harry turns into a snake similar to medusa.

linkao3(384548) Most if not all StarLight_Massacre stuff is slash so not sure you're into that but is him turning into a Dracken which is essentially a dragon person. Author has several stories based on Dracken Harry with various pairings. Still does updates.

linkffn(12005360) Funny short HPxLotr cross over.

linkffn(10884162) HpxHobbit one.

All I can think of off the top of my head.

  Harry comes into a very unexpected inheritance. He is a creature both rare and very dangerous, a creature that is black listed by the British Ministry. So now he must avoid detection at all costs, whilst choosing his life partners and dealing with impending pregnancy at just sixteen. With danger coming not just from the Ministry but even other creatures, what was he supposed to do?

  He was only twelve, going on thirteen. And shouldn't Madame Pomfrey been able to detect this and stop it while he'd been in the hospital wing? Because seriously? This? This thing right here? It had to have been something to do with the Basilisk having bitten him. A whole new spin on the Snake!Harry Genre with some Ancestor! thrown in.

** linkffn(12610360)\\
We, Harry Potter by wille179 is a Harry turned into a five-headed dragon, as a result of the basilisk biting him in second year. It's pretty funny, mainly because of the ludicrous interactions between the 5 heads.

[[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/enter-the-dragon-harry-potter-shadowrun.7861/]] Enter the Dragon has Harry being turned into a very powerful dragon at a young age, with the focus of the fic (as I recall) slowly steering towards a scheme to destroy pureblood supremacy. There's a fair bit of the typical Powerful!Harry wheeling and dealing and money-making and world-building, but the characters have enough personality to stop it from being boring.\\
Do note it's on Questionable Questing, and it does have some rude bits, but it's not adults-only enough to require an account.

Oh, and there's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5915237/1/Harry-Basilisk][Harry Basilisk by Lucillia]]; it was never finished but it's a pleasant enough read where nothing goes terribly wrong.

P.S. Don't forget, you can press the 'flair' button under your post to add a flair to the thread title. I recommend the 'Request' flair when you're asking for people to recommend fics along a certain theme to you, and 'What's That Fic?' when you want help finding a specific fic that you remember reading before.

  Down in the Chamber of Secrets, as Harry was dying from the basilisk venom, something awoke within his blood that began changing him, body, mind, and soul. The destruction of the horcrux in his head kicked that process in the metaphorical balls. Now, what are Harry, Harry, Harry, Harry, and Harry to do as a literal five-headed dragon? (some fluff, no bashing, not power wank.)

** Well, I guess [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/harry-is-a-dragon-and-thats-okay-hp-au-crack.731548/][Harry Is A Dragon And That's Okay]] might count.

Although we still haven't found out just /why/ Harry is a Dragon.
