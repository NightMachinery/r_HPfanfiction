For example, Neville, Dean, Seamus, Susan Bones etc.?

Just looking for something that isn't really Golden Trio centric.


** Oh there are tons of them out there. Have a quick ff search for characters you like so you get results catered to your tastes. I haven't read many non trio fics recently so I can't think of any off the top of my head, but here's a one shot about Dudley that I thought was exceptionally well written.
