:END:
I read a lot of HP Fanfic and sometimes I forget to save the ones I like. This is one of them, I read it quite some time ago and cant really remember any more details than this.

​

As the title says, Harry had a muggle Girlfriend over the Summer (I think after OotP, her family had a dog that looked like Padfoot) and was making pictures from tiny stones (can´t remember the exact word, probably a mosaic) as a summer job where he met this Girl. He went to a waterpark with her once, but thats about all the detail I remember.

​

Sadly, she later dies in a deatheater attack while Harry is forced to flee on a broom with Remus. I think he got together with Ginny in the end, but I might be wrong.

​

Thanks for the effort!

  What if Harry had waited ten more minutes and said goodbye to the waitress in HP/HBP? Prequel, "What We Had," is now up on my page!
