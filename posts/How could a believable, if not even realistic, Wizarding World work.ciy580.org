We all know that the HP books make no sense from a muggle perspective, which is okay. But I'm also quite sure, that many of us have wondered how would a Wizarding World work if it was based in our reality, or at least as close to our reality as possible.

Examples: CCTV, historical texts not mentioning wizards, Statute of Secrecy being enacted in 1689 and yet we have a country named Bulgaria?, Arthur Weasley being ignorant about muggles, magicals behaving like regular people, usage of the same vernacular etc. etc. These are just some of the issues, because there are countless more, that stop the JKR world from being truly a foreign culture, that has been separated from ours by 300+ years of history.

​

What would be your ideas about a semi-realistic, or as I said believable, Wizarding World? How would muggle-borns be handled? What about growing food? International relations? Borders? Magical Creatures? Voldemort type wizards killing muggles? ... I mean there are a million and one questions that JKR never even bothered to address (which is fine, because it was a YA fantasy series).

How would a Wizarding World exist and what would be the consequences for HP canon?


** I would think that international borders would either be very different from modern muggle borders, or there must be some internal force which requires wizarding borders to match the borders of muggle countries (perhaps as a clause in the statute of secrecy, on the logic that it will prevent the wizarding and muggle worlds from drifting too far apart).

If the borders are different, it would lead to wondering how they are different. Presumably they would have stayed roughly similar up until 1689, and then you have a few generations of wizards with lingering sympathies, loyalties, and connections to the muggle nations. And consider that Dumbledore died at 115, and was in seemingly good physical and mental health. Someone works at the Ministry who remembers proctoring Dumbledore's exams. That means they must have been a reasonably experienced witch/wizards by the time Dumbledore was around 17. Surely proctoring exams isn't something you stroll straight into from school, so she must have been in her 20's at least by that point and was still going strong in 1995.

So those generations with connections to the muggle world will have been in influence for...a long time. I'd guess the century following the statute coming in, wizards would have likely continued to conform to muggle international politics, at least in part. So it would be...the time of Empire building that they really started to differ on that logic. Maybe because wizards decided not to participate? Could that be because the factors that made colonial areas good targets for western nations don't apply to the magical world? Indeed, the things that make having colonies valuable don't apply to wizards particularly. It'd just be an expensive point of pride.

Can't continue this line of thought now, but I might come back to it later and continue the thought experiment.

*** Small countries probably wouldn't have corresponding magical ones as it would be impractical. So magical Luxemburg wouldn't be a thing, and it'd be part of magical Prussia or something. There's a good chance that the duke of magical France didn't get caught in the French Revolution and there's still one ruling magical France today. Same with whoever worked with the Russian Tsars, the commies probably wouldn't have accepted the wizards in their countries and as such wouldn't have even known about them. The magical Ottoman Empire might still be a thing. There's also a chance that Native Americans might have their own independent nations.

Read linkffn(Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution; Divided and Entwined; Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider; Harry Potter and the Secret of Atlantis) for where I got these ideas from.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

Add to that the fact that House Elves exist. At least inside the house, a large portion of the slave role has already been filled.

Finally Wizards seem to place value far less in labor and far more in skill. There isn't a whole lot of nonmagical stuff that wizards struggle to acquire.

For the Statute of Secrecy to remain in existence during the period of the slave trade, either Wizards would have needed to be actively complicit in maintaining slavery (i.e stopping the magical born children of slaves from interfering in slavery) despite having no support for it themselves and knowing it's morally evil and having the ability with magic to end it in an afternoon, or every muggleborn from a slave family would have to be a sociopath content to abandon their family and never, even as an adult, try to help them.

********* They couldn't have allowed any major interference without getting serious trouble from international politics. That applies to any kind of interference that couldn't be explained away without magic. If someone did something which could've made people think about magic and endangered secrecy, there would've been an international team of obliviators coming in, undoing everything and arresting the one responsible immediately, no matter the circumstances. Wizards would do tons of subtle things to help, but nothing major as it'd be undone anyway. International politics would justify it as necessary for the continued survival of wizards around the world.

Let's not forget that a lot of rich and influential wizards don't give a damn about filthy muggles and mudbloods suffering. They'd do anything to secure secrecy as a world without secrecy would be a lot more trouble for them.

Secrecy is a really big deal for wizards around the world. Even Voldemort didn't dare any attacks on muggles that couldn't be explained away as hurricanes or engineering failures because he didn't want a situation where every single wizarding nation around the world declares war on him, which would happen if he broke secrecy.

*** About muggleborn slaves/serf: If you mean New World slavery, then most likely. Elsewhere around the world it was more institutionised, so it would not be that big of a deal. An idea: a peasant kid (a serf) who was found by a wizard to possess magic is taken away and his death statged (a transfigured dog or something, let's say he drowned in a well). That could be one explanation.

As to magic on other continents. Here, you have a carte blanche. We literally know very little. It could be that Africa never had an organized magical world. China, India and the rest of the Far East could be even more removed from their muggle counterparts as the European muggles etc.

There are logical ways to explain all of that, but it to make it consistent would be a very large hassle.

** The specific concerns you list are not necessarily as hard to work around as you think. CCTV was beginning to become widespread in the 90s, but provided wizards avoided police stations, other government buildings, and major public transport hubs they should be able to work around it - assuming that they know to do so. That Kings Cross works normally on September the 1st indicates that enough of them /do/ know to do so. CCTV wouldn't become a really significant impediment until the mid 2000s when it began to be seriously networked and automation started to come in, and it became very widespread.

Bulgaria existed as an independent entity a couple of times in the pre-modern era, and under Ottoman rule they were found to be useful rebels by the Austro-Hungarian empire several times in the 1680s. You can just say that one of those revolts did rather well in the magical world, or that magical Bulgaria remained independent when the non-magical peoples were absorbed into the Ottoman empire in the 13th century.

Arthur is ignorant of /some/ technology and cultural artefacts but not of muggles per se. Remember, he managed to enchant a car, and he presumably did so with the intention of using it.

The language is kept comprehensible because of muggle-born "immigration", continuing relations between wizards and their muggle relatives, and social and business contact between the two groups. The statute of secrecy is about /secrecy/, not /segregation/.

Yes, we don't see much of that inter-community interaction in the books, and we see some people who want segregation, but the books make no attempt to show us all of magical society. You can wriggle around a lot of the problems with the books if you take them as being primarily the viewpoint of one sheltered child who has very few friends, experiencing events that are unusual (unusual both for us readers and for the society he lives in), and with other unreliable narrators who have agendas of their own.

** In the case of Arthur Weasley, I don't think his "ignorance" is a problem in itself. The work of Arthur, and of the "Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office" seem to be very simple : Someone jinxed a muggle artifact, they are called on the crime scene to "collect" it. The arrest of the wizard who did it seem to be left to the Magical Law Enforcement, and I think even the Oblivaton of the Muggle victims is handled by another department.

So, to do his job, Arthur only need to be able to identify a jinxed item (I do say jinxed because I think a cursed one is already above is paycheck and dealed by Aurors and/or Curse Breakers), considering the magic "leave traces", even someone with absolutely no knowledge of the Muggle World should potentially be able to do it.\\
Add at this that most of the Jinxed items which are mentioned in canon are items used in both world (dissapearing keys, bitting doorknobs . . .) and it makes it even simpler for a pureblood to do.

​

I would also like to mention that, even if it doesn't like this, Arthur Weasley is rather knowledgable of the Muggle World for a Pureblood. He knows, for example, enough about a car to enchant it without making it obvious, and is able to drive it the Muggle way, I doubt most pureblood could do this.\\
Also, the Muggles things Arthur ask about are always very particular things :

- In CoS, he asks Harry what rubber ducks are used for : they are useless (if you forget about the "special" use a kinda sheltered 12 years boy like Harry should not know about)
- In GoF, he has trouble starting a fire with matches : he is a wizard who learnt how to ignite things in 1st year like everyone else, matches are inferior to a wand.
- In OotP, he doesn't know how to use the subway : why would he even use the subway. The closest thing to the subway for a wizard should be the "floo network", which is already far superior to subway. He also has several ways to teleport, and even a magic car or a broom should he want to go slower. A wizard would never be forced to use the floo, basically all their method of travels are faster and/or more confortable than it.

​

All the Muggle things he doesn't know about are things that are not only specific, but things a wizard would never encounter in his life. So the fact that he doesn't know about it doesn't bother me and I think he can easily do his job even without knowing this.\\
If I had to make a comparison, Arthur is a bit like a specialist doctor : if you go to a podiatrist complaining about your eyes, the guys will tell you he has no idea how to help you and direct you toward another doctor, does it make him a bad doctor? The difference is that Arthur loves everything about the Muggles and will try to learn things even outside of what is concerned by his work.

*** I have to disagree on all the points. Arthur Weasley is an intelligent, competent wizard, but in the books he's a moron. You mentioned him not being able to use the subway... as far as I remember he could not use muggle money. How can somebody be involved with muggles in his daily job and not know what a paper pound looks like? It doesn't make any sense.

As to the rubber duck thing, that might just be curiosity and a bit of naiveity. From a wizard's perspective it might be a bit silly.

The matches... Perhaps. I could see a sheltered wizard not understanding them, but not someone who deals with muggle artifacts for a living. I'm sure he handled lots of matches in his career. It's one of the reasons why I even started this thread, since most of muggle/wizard interactions in canon make no sense.

So, no I would not agree, and I don't think your analogy with the specialist doctor works, or even makes sense. If I were to expand on it, it would be like going to a neurosurgeon for advice and him not knowing what flu is.

** One issue I have is the PM being informed by the Minister of Magic of magical affairs and just being passive about it.

There is no way they would not have located, recruited, researched on and prepared against enemy wizards. What if a rival nation has a powerful group of hit wizards aimed at the UK government? These are people that can apparate, impersonate, turn to animals, paralyze, mind control... Too great an opportunity to pass, too dangerous to ignore. They would have magical MI-6 operatives. Goblins would be warding all sensitive government facilities, and get paid way more that the tiny magical community can afford.

And dark lords going after muggle born wizards that don't ask their muggle government for protection? They just die?

*** Yes, that's one of the issues. The intereference and fluidity between muggle and magical. How would it believably work? In my opinion the only way it would work is total, absolute isolation. A single wizard let loose in, for example, the Pentagon, could cause WW3 in a couple of minutes.

**** Besides, you are a muggle born wizard with some ambition, imagine how easy it would be to become rich? Impersonate a millionaire, imperio and obliviate his bank manager, show up in Gringotts with a (shrunk) trunk full of sterling and gold (goblins ask no questions), et voila! Rich wizard, fresh out of Hogwarts. The insider info you could get before corporate quarterly earnings, maybe steal IP, spy for the government for immunity, mind boggling...

Then you buy dark books through intermediaries, get a fine, heavily warded mansion, finance elections... sky's the limit, mudblood or not.

In fact, this is turning into a prompt for a fanfiction, isn't it?
