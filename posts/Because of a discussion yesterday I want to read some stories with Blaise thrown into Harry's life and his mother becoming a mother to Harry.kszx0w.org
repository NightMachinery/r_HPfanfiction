** The Vellum and Serpentine series by Lomonaaeren is like that.

Link and description of the first part: linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15260055/chapters/35396316]])

#+begin_quote
  AU. Voldemort cursed Harry in the graveyard so that he can only speak Parseltongue. Harry embarks on his fifth year alternately furious and despairing and trying to learn faster writing, British Sign Language, and nonverbal casting all at once. It turns out that not all Slytherins are Malfoy or Snape, and not everyone is frightened of Parseltongue.
