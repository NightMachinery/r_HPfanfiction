I was just wondering how some of us would pronounce the names of various Harry Potter characters out loud --- the movies don't have to be a gold standard.

The obvious one is the T in Lord Voldemort --- silent or not, for you?

Judging by how one pronounces "dragon", it'd only make sense to pronounce Draco the same ("Drah-co") rather than "Drake-o" as the movies do.

How about Lucius? "Lu-ss-ious", or "Lu-sh-ious"?

Do you pronounce Lestrange the French way (something like "Luh-stronge"), or do you just say "Less-Strange", or something else?

The "Rubeus" in "Rubeus Harid". Would you rather have an anglicized "roobyus" or a more Latin-accurate "Roo-bee-oos", or even an even more anclicized version like "Rub-yus"?

"McGonagall" --- do you insist on the "Mac-Gonagall", or go "Magonagall"? Do you pronounce the ending "-all" as "all", or "al"?

"Severus" --- The movies pronounce it "Sev'rus", wondering if someone else than me used to put the accent on the "ve" or at least stretch it out a little more.

"Hogwarts" --- Movie!Hagrid's accent is such that he pronounces it something like "Hogw-arts", with an open "a"; wondering if that's stuck with some people instead of a more logical "Hog-wawrts" based on the individual pronounciation of "warts".

------

Be sure to also submit any other one you may have in mind that I missed!


** Voldemort with the T in the end. And I hate the Lu-sh-ious pronunciation of Lucius.

I think I just go by how it's all pronounced in the Stephen Fry audiobooks. He was in contact with JK Rowling during some of the recording, if not all, so that's good enough for me.

***** She corrected his pronunciation on a few things if I remember an interview correctly. Some spells, I think. I grew up on the Jim Dale version (not sure why the USA got Dale, who in comparison is rather unknown in the states compared to Fry) and he definitely is the reason I hear words pronounced a different way. (Akkio vs asio for accio). (Love your flair btw)

** 1) I keep the T.

2) Dray-co, like the constellation.

3)Lew-see-us - the Lush-us pronunciation makes me ill.

4) The anglicised Lestrange.

5) Ruby - us

6) Ew ew ew, its Ma-Gonagall. I'm Scottish, there are rules about how you pronounce 'mac's, any Mc or Mac before a G makes the C silent - like McGee (Ma-gee) or McGill, McGregor or McGraw (and their Mc equivalents) .

7) I don't hear Sev'rus in the movies tbh.

8) Neither do I hear a weird Hogwarts.

Depends if I'm speaking French or English.

#+begin_quote
  How about Lucius? "Lu-ss-ious", or "Lu-sh-ious"?
#+end_quote

The former for me. If you wanted to pronounce it in the proper, Latin way, it seems you should say 'Lu-k-ious'.

#+begin_quote
  Do you pronounce Lestrange the French way (something like "Luh-stronge"), or do you just say "Less-Strange", or something else?
#+end_quote

As a French, the former doesn't feel natural. I say 'Less-strange' in both languages and have never heard anybody saying 'Luh-strange' while speaking French. The 'an' would be pronounced differently in French, though. 'An' is treated as a single sound in this case and the 'n' wouldn't be pronounced. The 'a' would be different from the usual 'a', but I don't think this particular sound exists in English. Perhaps something like the 'an' in 'fantasy' if you don't pronounce the 'n'... The movie used 'Less-strange', too, in the dubbed versions.

I"m not sure I can explain properly how I pronounce the other ones in French, as some sounds from one language don't necessarily exist in the other. (For instance, the 'u' and the 'r' are really different in both language, the English 'e' is sometimes similar to the French's 'i' (pronounced like the 'e' in 'be') and sometimes to the 'è' (as in 'let').\\
I've spent several minutes trying to come up with a way to describe how I pronounce 'Rubeus', sadly I failed.

*** Yes, I am aware. /I happen to be French./

Passons donc en Français pour simplifier les choses. C'est un peu compliqué d'exprimer des sons typiquement gaulois avec la phonétique anglaise...

Donc, /Lestrange/.

- On peut le prononcer Le Strange en pronoucant 'ange' à la française, ce qui est ce que j'essayais de faire comprendre à un anglophone par "Luh-stronge" --- j'ai vu des gens utiliser "on" comme approximation du "an" français.

- On peut le prononcer "L'estrange" comme si "estrange" était une version médiévalisante de "étrange".

- On peut le prononcer à l'Anglaise avec "/Less-strange/".

Le premier est en effet probablement un barbarisme (la seconde option étant, je pense, ce que Rowling avait en tête), mais je sais que beaucoup d'auteurs de fan-fictions malorthographient le nom en "Le Strange", donc il me paraissait plausible que certains prononcent "faussement à la Française", donc "Luh Str'an'ge", avec ou sans un "an" français.

**** Oh. Oui, ce sera plus facile de cette manière.\\
Franchement, Le Strange, j'ai jamais entendu. Pas en Français en tout cas. Mais y'en a peut-être qui le disent comme ça. Ca ne me parait idiot de penser que certains anglophones le prononce comme ça en pensant que ça fait Français, non plus. Un peu de la même façon qu'on prononçait tous 'tomb rIder' au lieu de 'tomb rAIder' à l'époque, si tu t'en souviens.\\
J'avais pas vraiment pensé à 'é-strange' contre 'è-strange'. Je le dis plus ou moins de la même façon dans les 2 langues. La seconde façon. Je pense que c'est ce que faisaient les films, aussi. L'autre manière me semble pas choquante, cela-dit.\\
L'autre question, maintenant, c'est comment disent les Québéquois? ;)

Je cringe toujours un peu quand je lis des fics qui mentionnent Morgane par contre, ils ne savent jamais quel nom choisir, ni quelle orthographe - Morgana Le Fey, Morgan Le Fey... Ça me fait toujours bizarre. De même quand je rencontre des mots français d'ailleurs, ou quand l'accent de Fleur est écrit.

Pour le reste, en général je prononce à la française les noms, sauf si le nom a changé dans la traduction (Snaype, pas Snap, par exemple). Et Grangeur et Malfoye évidemment, pas Grangé et Malfoi, contrairement à l'un (au moins) des jeux vidéos HP il me semble.

** I pronounce Tom's nickname with an audible T. I know the official pronunciation is with a silent T, and I do know that the movies (which use an audible T) do not count, but in-universe it makes no sense for the nickname to use French pronunciation when Tom based it not on French language but rather on what he could anagram from his name.

As for the rest of the names, I go with what feels natural for a society that seems to be at least in some way using old languages and as such would care about the way things are pronounced; thus “Drah-co”, “Lu-ki-us”, “Roo-bee-oos”, “Se-ve-rus”, “Ma-Go-na-gall”, and so on. The Lestranges are a bit of an exception, since I have no basis to think that their name is French so I go with “Le-strenj”, but if Madame Rowling ever revealed that they do indeed have French roots then I would not have problems with switching.

I also pronounce Karkaroff's name with hard Rs (Krum's too). Oh, and while I pronounce Ginny “Jinny”, Ginevra is “Gui-nev-ra”. Likewise, Remus is “Reh-mus”. And the French people have their names properly frenched.

Uh, I think it's a bit too much of a coincidence for /Voldemort/ to mean what it does in French purely by accident. I'm pretty sure of all possible anagrams, Tom picked this one /because/ he knew, and liked, the French meaning of the result.

**** Yes, that is a possibility. But consider this: canon-wise, it's unlikely for Tom to actually know, or at least have known at the time when the anagram was made and chosen, French. As such, it is more likely that, in-universe--wise rather than on meta level, he chose it not for what it means but rather for how it sounds.

And I simply use the pronunciation that is more likely in-story.
