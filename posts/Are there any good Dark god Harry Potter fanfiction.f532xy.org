#+begin_quote
  When Zelretch conducts an experiment and the being known to all as Fate intervenes Harry Potter's life is changed irrevocably. Now being raised by those who don't fit the definition of 'Normal' it is a very different Harry that is unleashed on the world. Or is it worlds? Disclaimer: This is fan fiction, I only own the plot.

**** I cant believe I never sent you a reply. My apologies I started reading and couldn't get enough and I must admit I forgot you gave this to me. My apologies. I read it and the sequel multiple times and I just have to say I love you.
