Preferably completed, if not then continuously updated.

Hermione is a badass, I wanna read things with her as the main character, being her badass self.

Light, grey, or dark are all fine.

Examples: New Blood, Green Girl

Thanks!


** This should be a 100% fit, the summary really doesn't do the story justice:

  Hermione was eight when she summoned her first demon. She was lonely. He asked what she wanted, and she said a friend to have tea parties with. It confused him a lot. But that wasn't going to stop him from striking a promising deal with the young witch. Dark!Hermione, Slytherin!Hermione, occult theme. Complete.

** Dont know how to link but my absolute favorite hermione fic is on fanfiction.net by White squirrel

The Arithmancer » Hermione grows up as a maths whiz instead of a bookworm and tests into Arithmancy in her first year. With the help of her friends and Professor Vector, she puts her superhuman spellcrafting skills to good use in the fight against Voldemort. Years 1-4. Sequel posted

It is a 3 part series with 2nd book: lady Archimedes (years 5-end war) and 3rd: annals of arithmancy with one shot like chapters. Hermione is a complete bad ass.

The writer completely made up the theory of magic and the magic around spellcrafting, arithmancy, runes and Rituals magic. It is amazing and very well writen. Prob my fav fic ever.

#+begin_quote
  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

  Fourteen years after the war ended, Lord Voldemort rules Britain with a fist of iron, killing anyone who stands in his way. The remnants of The Army of Light are scattered and in hiding, and no one has seen Harry Potter since he vanished at the start of his fifth year. But when Voldemort's Prime Minister is assassinated in broad daylight, the resistance gains a renewed sense of hope, and start to believe that the war is not yet over.

** I'd check out anything by [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/5751039/corvusdraconis][Corvusdraconis]]. Her fics can be a little niche, but I have yet to find one that isn't enjoyable.

If you don't mind crossovers, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13968495][Lollies and Loki]] is a great HP/SPN story. You don't really need to know anything about Supernatural for this fic to make sense. A quick google for some basic background info will be enough. It ends right before Hermione goes to Hogwarts, but the next part is being written. Part 1 can be read own it's own without feeling like a cliffhanger.

Another fantastic crossover (HP and LoTR) that is a little more involved in the other world's setting and mythos is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7239202][The Elvenqueen]].
