Or just something that takes a little twist to the whole thing. I've been really into HP lately, but reading JUST HP fics can get a little repetitive at times so I'm trying to 'broaden my horizons' I suppose.

Some crossovers I have found I liked are; KHR particularly the Harry as Skull trope, Addams family, Death note, SOME Manwa Gamer though not much, Rwby, Sherlock, Criminal minds and Hellsing.

I don't really care if your rec is one of these or not, I watch/read just about anything, but I really just want something that screws with the timeline and doesn't have Harry for example Staying friends with Ron despite being a Dark Wizard or something like that, and these are some examples of thd stuff I like.

Oh, and the more morbid the better! 😈☠👹

Thank you and well wishes.

** Linkffn(Under the Veil by Poplasia)

If your looking for morbid, there has been the creation of both a orbital railgun, and the main character stabbed themselves in the past two chapters alone.

Do keep in mind this is a very much terrible way to describe this, and takes quite a bit out of context.

Basicly the story so far is Sans from Undertale gets himself stuck in the void due to plot, and meets Sirius black, who just got himself thrown into the veil of death. They teleport to the Harry potter universe, traveling through time, where plot happens, It updates roughly once an month.

It avoids the pitfalls of both fanons, I.E. manipulative dumbledore, terrible twinspeak, and jerkish ron.

  Dumbledore thinks Harry is in Spain with the Dursleys. The Dursleys thinks he's spending the summer with 'his lot'. And maybe Harry feels a little guilty about lying to them and to his friends about his whereabouts. But if they don't want to tell him what's going on with Voldemort, then he doesn't have to tell them he's taken up stunt-biking, right ? Harry-is-Skull AU.

  Once, Harry died in a forest, and that was the start of all his troubles. Not Voldemort, not the Dursleys.Just dying... and then choosing to get up again.Harry goes on an extended holiday to forget everything, but finds his relaxation interrupted again and again by a smooth talking, stylishly dressed stranger. No matter where he goes he keeps running into the man in the black suit, and while Harry knows he shouldn't, some part of him can't help but enjoy the man's company. Especially when the world is so cold and dark when he's not around...

  The Arcobaleno, betrayed by their previous Sky, are always looking, always searching, always wondering. But days turn to weeks and weeks turn to months and months turn to years, and to search and have hope with no results is too painful, even for them, so they stop. They go on with their day-to-day lives, sometimes allowing themselves an illusion of hope before crushing it once more. It is when they cease to look, to search, to wonder, that is when she finds them. And so the strongest seven finally belong. And she does too.

  Skull wonders sometimes if one day, he will slip and forget to lie. It doesn't quite happen like that, but it does take just one night. One night that loosens his tongue and Skull can't lie anymore. Well, he can, but the selective blindness of his fellow ex-Arcobaleno vanished the instant he spoke the words, "I was a soldier." He carries his scars, hidden under the leather and the make-up. From Voldemort, Malfoy Manor and the battles he's fought and survived. He was fine with being weak. The weak are never called to lead, to protect.

  There were plenty of things about this situation that Harry was less than thrilled about - the kidnapping, for one, though that seemed fairly obvious. Getting stuck in the body of a stranger wasn't quite the joyful occasion either. Having that stranger running around in his body, even less so - all this, of course, ignoring the fact that he couldn't use his magic anymore. Well, it wasn't like things could get worse....What did the mafia have to do with this?

  Acedia (noun): spiritual or mental sloth; apathy. In Latin, it means "without care" or the neglect of to take care of something that one should do. After abandoning the Wizarding World in his Fourth Year, Harry James Potter thought this suited him perfectly. After all...he doesn't give a damn anymore. HP/KHR Crossover. Cloud Officer!Harry.

** The problem with most crossovers is that they are from people who are desperately unhappy with some fundamental characteristics of HP universe, mostly finding Harry to be not enough superhero in the style of Marvell comics and similar. And they are right, Harry is not superhero. It always fascinated me as even after defeat of Voldemort he is distinctively NOT a superhero, but a little more experienced, a little bit more battered, but still seventeen year old student of Hogwarts a year before his graduation. More to this [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/harry-potter-and-dorothy-sayers.html][on my blog]].

So, better chance for a crossover is in non-fantasy land:

- linkao3(Operation Wandless by EllianaDunla) is the crossover between HP and TV series Spooks (about MI-5).
- linkffn(Sherlock Holmes and the Adventure of the Seventh Safeguard by Charlotte Ann Kent) really nicely done crossover between HP and Sherlock (something between the Doyle's Sherlock Holmes and the modern Sherlock)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12447494/1/][*/Sherlock Holmes and the Adventure of the Seventh Safeguard/*]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/7613719/Charlotte-Ann-Kent][/Charlotte Ann Kent/]]

#+begin_quote
  When Scotland Yard is stumped by the murder of Amelia Bones Sherlock Holmes investigates the seemingly impossible locked room mystery. His conclusion? "They teleported." Seven months later they bump into a trio of teens in a London cafe and John Watson discovers that his friend was perfectly serious. They are now in the thick of the strangest case of the great detective's career.

** Linkffn(Brother in Arms) a Creepypasta crossover with lots of death

Linkffn(Harry by Proxy) more creepypasta and death

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Underground's Saviour) An Undertale crossover, less dark stuff, more fluff and anticipation

Linkffn(Five Nights With Harry) a fnaf crossover with no death but good plot. Sadly, it seems to be abandoned, but I'd love someone to pick it back up

Linkffn(Evil Be Thou My Good) I think it's a Hellbringer crossover, and it's very well written. It's also very dark and there's a lot of mildy-descriptive gore at the end.
