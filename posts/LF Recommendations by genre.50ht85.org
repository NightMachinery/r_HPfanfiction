I work at a bookstore and I'd like to get some great HP fics in different genres. If some fics overlap genres, list them both please! The only thing I'm asking for is quality fanfiction- no length requirements or specific characters or tropes. I'd like this to be a general rec list that we can link to in the FAQ.

Genres: Horror

Mystery

Adventure

Action/Thriller

Romance

Drama

Absurdist/Surrealism

Comedy

Family

Science Fiction

Fantasy (yes I know HP is fantasy already but plenty of fics don't focus on expanding on the fantastical aspects)

Historical

Political

Satire

Urban

Fanfiction specific: Meta fiction

Did I miss a major genre? Let me know (with recs please). [If you want to submit [[/r/rational][r/rational]] as its own genre, feel free. HPMOR comment debates are always amusing. :)]


** For horror, I like linkffn(7713063) Elizium for the Sleepless Souls

  Being the recipient of the Order of Merlin and also having his picture on the Chocolate Frog Cards was not a big feat for Healer Tom Riddle. As Head Healer at St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, nothing much surprised him. Little did he know, his life was about to be turned upside down by the arrival of a bespectacled boy with messy hair through the Veil.

** Fantasy - Linkffn(Prince of the dark kingdom) This fic has always seemed more fantasy like than a lot of other ones I have read. It has a lot of great world building, a complex plot with a lot of fantasy and magical elements. It also has some great characters and manages to combine all these elements into a very interesting magical world.

** Horror: linkffn(3911615) technically it's considered pre-slash. However, it barely touches on that at all and even then only in the last chapter or so. This is one I haven't actually sat down and read in a long time and I still remember all of it, it's stays with you that much. I'm actually going to re-read it tonight, it's that good. The psychological horror of it is exceedingly well written.
