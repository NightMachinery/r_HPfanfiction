Please Help, I am unable to find this fic, where Harry becomes a dark wizard after going throught he path to become one.

If I remember correctly there is Slytherin!harry or at least friends with the slytherins of his year.

Sirius supports him, and he gets help from Narcissa.


** I'm pretty sure you're thinking of Evitative by Vichan on ao3.

#+begin_quote
  In the summer before his fifth year at Hogwarts, Harry is drawn to a room in Grimmauld Place. Like the Gryffindor he is, he enters the room without fear. The room is a library, and Harry is surprised to find that he's eager to learn. Then he gets the bad news: he's been accidentally expelled from Hogwarts, and he needs to be sorted again. Everyone is confident that he'll go straight back to Gryffindor, but with what he's been learning, Harry's not so sure.
