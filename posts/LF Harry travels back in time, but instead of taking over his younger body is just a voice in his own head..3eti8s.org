  AU. Time Travel. Harry Potter knows he is a wizard. He knows he is going to Hogwarts, where he will make friends for the first time in his life. He knows this because the Voice in his head told him so. The Voice says it is Harry from the future but Harry just wishes it would stop trying to take over his body.
