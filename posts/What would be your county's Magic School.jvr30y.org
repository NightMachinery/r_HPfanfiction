So I always wondered are there only 3 Magic Schools in Europe Hogwarts, Durmstrang and Beauxbatons. But there have to be more because if I was the leader of a country and my Wizards and Witches would have to travel to some foreign School it could cause some major problems. So here I am creating my wizarding school for my home country.

AUSTRIA: Theresia's Sorcery Academy

Once home to one of the largest Schools In the wizarding world Austria is now only a shadow of its former self. Whist, once Students from all over Germany and its former Empire attended the Halls of Theresia's now only the children of the 500 Austrian Wizarding families, attend the Academy.

Seeing as the School is hidden in the Austrian Zoo "Tiergarten Schönbrun" It should come as no surprise that the school has a focus on Magical creatures.

Whist its Creatures class is considered top-notch throughout the World all other classes lack the necessary funding and teachers to be considered one of the best schools in the Wizarding worlds.

There you go.

Now, what's your county's Magical school like?


** Well, New Zealand has a relatively small population, and the wizard to Muggle ratio might be a lot higher considering the mystical nature for the islands (home to several fantastic beasts and the Antipodean Opaleye dragon) so either New Zealand wizarding school is one big village/collection of buildings in the deep forests of the South Island, or New Zealander children with magic travel to Mahoutokoro, the Japanese school of magic. Perhaps there's an Australian school of magic in the outback or under the Great Barrier Reef they can go to.

The potential is huge!

**** For Australia, I would go with either Mount Kozsiusko in the snowy mountains or Mount Canobolas outside Orange. On balance though, I would go with the Snowies as my pick of choice given how a lot of the Wizards coming over would have gone to Hogwarts and would therefore probably want to locate their school in as cold a climate as possible for nostalgia's sake rather than anything else.

The Aboriginal Wizards would have a much more elaborate and complex approach to magical education where the community's adults teach the young everything they know over the course of their youth, an approach that works much better for their style rather than the rigidly structured one favoured by the European schools but is also more resource-intensive for the magical community as it involves, well, everyone instead of a small number of specialist teachers.

Both sides stay well away from each other.

***** well depending on what you go with

if the wizards came over freely they would likely settle in adelaide as it was mostly settled by free people.

if they where convicts like the muggle counterparts they would be in sydney.

I assume the aboriginal wizards would be basically dead as a culture with modern day descendants trying to revive it.

as for having the school in a cold climate, its not really needed as they can just use magic to make the place climate controlled

**** I don't think European wizards would want to set up a school in the remote outback. It would be too hot and far away from everything.

My thinking is that there are plenty of places in Australia which are remote and sparsely inhabited, without being that far away from major cities. That way they witches and wizards could still travel by train/boat in a reasonable time, and the climate would be more agreeable by European standards.

Some possibilities:

- A sparsely inhabited island off the coast of Tasmania (e.g. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Barren_Island][Cape Barren island]]), which could be accessed via magical ship from Melbourne or Hobart.

- A remote valley in the Australian Alps, (e.g. near [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Feathertop][Mount Feathertop]]) which could be accessed via a magical train from Melbourne

- A remote valley in the Blue Mountains (e.g. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravensdale,_New_South_Wales][Ravensdale]]), which could be accessed via magical train from Sydney.

I spent way too long looking for places with cool names.

*** People always get hung up on having an impressive school like Hogwarts but, even with magical travel, a lot of people would prefer to be closer to home. There isn't anything saying that there can't be small school somewhere. We don't know how many magicals there are in the world after all but if .1% of the population of New Zealand are magicals then that is still almost 5,000 people with average student percentages making them have 800 students (16-17% of population). If it is even a tenth of that then it is 80 students with 500 population. Well enough to have a small community with a small schoolhouse.

A brief look at the wiki says that there is conflicting information such as there are 10 times as many muggless as magicals while also saying there are only 3,000 magicals in the British Isles. I think with fanfiction that you could go either way with your story if you want as it is the realm of possibility.

** Well, we have Ilvermorny in the US. But I really dislike that school's story and design. So, I've been thinking up a new school on the west coast. It would be started by a Spanish wizard and named as such, to fit all of the other Spanish locations in California. It wouldn't be a castle but instead would be either a modern school or an old Spanish colonial style building. I think the school would initially start off being Spanish only but would transition to a multi-language school after the Spanish American war when the US took over that territory. There would be a class offering Spanish spells to maintain the school's history but also classes in other languages as well. I figure the US would be a hotspot for magical immigration as much as it was for non-magicals so the student body would be multicultural. It would be more interesting that way, since there would be many different cultures mixing together and potential for a lot of world building.

*** This makes so much sense though! A west coast/Californian wizarding college, and because wizards live in the past there also aren't such strict borders drawn between countries. So children from all along the west coast of North America go there because it's a great school. Yeah Mexico has it's own school of course but that's more in the heart of the country and more traditionally Mexican. Canada has a school too but that's on the east coast.

But also! All the immigration from China and East Asia! When the western gates of America opened up, a whole new influx of eastern culture slowly entered and grew in the school. It slowly became one of the most diverse and multi ethnic magical schools in the world, with a proud Spanish origin and tradition but with cultural and magical influences from Asia, Europe, Africa and parts of Central America.

That depends on whether the rest of magical US remains consistent with JK's. Real world US is such a hotspot because of the higher level of freedom and opportunities relative to the majority of the countries. JK's magical US seems exactly the opposite. Wizards are not even allowed to marry Muggles and they need permits for carrying wands.

**** I'm my head canon, those laws never existed and the US wizarding community is a lot more liberal than the UK. I think this is logical as I would assume that originally a lot of the wizards arriving in the colonial US would be those escaping the more rigid magical society in the UK: those of lower standing, i.e. halfbloods or muggleborns, or wizards married to muggles. And of course its possibly that they changed their opinions on this stuff down the line, but I just feel that's kinda unlikely.

****** That depends where you live. The big cities tend to be more progressive, while the countryside is more conservative. While I'm not a British, nor do I have any known ties with UK (nor do I know anything or care about politics, except that I hate extremes), from the statistics I saw related to Brexit votes, it seems the same is valid over there. Since the Wizarding community is so isolated, I would expect it to lean more towards the conservative side. However, in the HP-verse, there seems that some people make a genuine effort of integrating others in the community in Magical Britain. However from JK's description on Pottermore of Magical US, it seems it's rather exclusivist with Rappaport's Law even forbidding friendships with Muggles (I could not find the 1960s abolishment in the WW articles).

******* Yeah, that's true here too.

My thoughts on the difference between the US and Britain is that while both are lurching to the right, there's a differencr in degree. For example, everyone agrees the NHS should be free at the point of access (although many Brexiters feel it should only be for British Citizens), whereas universal health care is a contentious issue in the US.

The current Conservative government are banking on people swollowing their lies about loving the NHS/looking after it, while they slowly strip it down.

Similarly (for now) we have much better employment rights and health and safety regulations than the US.

I've run out of time for my thoughts on the wizarding world but will reply again later.

** Germany. Due to its fractured history Germany actually has many smaller schools. One is Brockenrode, located inside the Harz national park.

It was founded under the rule of Queen Mathilda, mother of Otto the First, making it older than Hogwarts by almost 50 years and the teachers take great pride in that.

From the late 1950s to 1989 Brockenrode was located on the border of former West Germany and former East Germany. This was great for security from the average muggle, but not so great when trying to hide from the muggle government. When the protection of the borde no longer worked, the wizarding authorities managed to convince the muggles to establish the national park with a no-go zone at the center.

Brockenrode is a very small school with 40-60 students in total with an intake of 4-6 per year. During the Cold War Brockenrode was considered undesirable by the magical population due to its location, so there were even fewer students. It allowed the teachers to really focus on the few talents they got, with outstanding results. Upon German reunification the school instantly became very popular. Currently there are more applicants than spots, resulting in a student population that is mostly wizard-born. They continue to reserve one spot per year for muggle-borns who live in or around the Harz mountains, but since muggle-borns are rare they can often give away said spot at the start of the school year to one hopeful wizarding-born student.

EDIT: The early 1990s saw a big brain drain from Brockenrode. Many teachers left because they either finally could or were run out for co-operation with the East German muggle security forces. So all that is left is a school with a favourable teacher-student ratio run over by kids who got in on their parents connections and not on talent.

**** AFAIK not. All we know that Durmstrang is unplottable.

But in general what is Germany today is not cold enough for fur. I remember a thread on Fictionalley debating the location of issue ad nauseam and the general consensus was that it was somewhere cold but with a connection that allowed a ship to sail more or less directly to Scotland. The opinions were evenly split between what is today Russian territory or Scandinavia. I've seen one or two fics placing Durmstrang on Novaya Zemlya.

My personal headcanon says that those locations are too harsh. Great for hiding a castle, but impossible to heat without using magic constantly. Add in the factor of transporting underage kids to Durmstrang and it becomes clear you want it somewhere accessible.

I would place Durmstrang in one of the islands in the Baltic Sea at a crossroad between what used to be East Prussia (and belonged to Germany prior to WWII), the Baltic states, Sweden, Finnland and Russia. There are a gazillion of small islands between Sweden and Finland and the coastline from what is today Kaliningrad to St. Petersburg has a lot of options as well.

Some proposed Gotland which kinda makes sense especially when you consider the history with the Hanseatic League.

** I'm from India - I believe there would either be a Magical School for each state since the population is so huge , or there would be one HUGE boarding school set up somewhere in Madhya Pradesh since its centrally located or maybe somewhere close to Delhi. So here goes -

Karmanasya Vidyalayaha is India's largest Magical University , with over 40,000 students , located in Sanchi , Madhya Pradesh. It was set up by the great Mauryan Emperor Ashoka in 260BC . Over the centuries through the rise and fall of many dynasties and the subcontinent being fractured , the school maintained its high standards of education by teaching Magic in Sanskrit , Old Tamil , Pali and Prakrit to attract students from all over the subcontinent. It's popularity really exploded under colonial rule by the British , as it was the only University large enough and remote enough to escape prosecution by the British Empire .

Upon Indian independence ,it still accepted students from Pakistan and Bangladesh , though students in Pakistan often choose to study in Arabia The most controversial decision it ever undertook was the inclusion of Latin spells in 1900s , as it was seen as submission to colonialism . Nowadays though the decision has been widely applauded as it significantly reduced the stigma of arts such as Parseltongue which was always common in India but were viewed as dark arts in the west.

I initially did think of a number around 20k but it seemed too low so I quadupled it. But I agree with you that 80k is too high - perhaps 40k will be better. It will probably look like CIty Montessori School but bigger in scale.

*** I like this a lot but I also feel like a single school would never work just because of language issues. I mean - Hindi is the most “commonly spoken” language and it's just 57% of the population. English is spoken by what, 10%? And that's counting 1st/2nd/3rd language speakers combined. If we look at just native proficiency, Hindi is 40% and English is 0.02%, and I haven't even gotten into languages like Bengali which are primarily spoken in one state but still 8% of the population speaks it natively. Unless we headcanon the existence of perfect translation spells, I just don't see how it would be possible to do only one school. You'd need at least one school per commonly spoken language so that's like... 20-something schools. I mean I get that “spell language” doesn't need to necessarily be the same as their actual classroom language, but they'd need to teach and explain the curriculum in the native tongue of the student. Unless your headcanon includes “language tracks”, so you can choose to take your classes in any one of the official languages.

**** I know this sort of thing would come hence I was very hesitant on whether to make one unified school- but I'm Imagining huge IIT esque campuses and things like that -dorms instead of individual rooms obviously. The sheer amount of effort required would be a very difficult thing but that's how most Indian Schools are to be honest. One thing I did think of was Schools being established by the British like presidency colleges - 1 each in Delhi Bombay Calcutta and Madras - but it felt like it would be weird and detract from our rich precolonial history.

Besides , the magical population would be much less densly populated than non magical one so thats one thing to keep in mind.

Another idea could be to keep one for North India , set in Indraprastha/Delhi . One for south India , set as a school for Dravidian magic . And a third more recent one set in Calcutta or Dhaka by the British for Indian/English fusion magic where most Bangladeshi people also come to learn.

***** I guess huge IIT style campuses could work! Though I like the idea of there being multiple schools more. You could never have an enormous school in Bombay lol there just isn't any space :D

And true, while the magical population would be smaller than the non magical population we have to assume it would be equally spread between the different states, hence the aforementioned language issues.

I think you'd probably end up with one school in the north and one in the south, like you said, perhaps one in the North East, and then one in WB/Bangladesh. But I still think each one of these schools will have to offer the ability to study in more than one language, because we're talking about class 6 students here - they would be far less likely to be able to study in a language that was not the language they did primary school in.

** I'm half-German, half-Croat. Since someone else already mentioned Germany, I'd go with Croatia - the Magical Institute of Rijeka, hidden in plain sight in the library of Trsat.

Since the population of the Balkans was never that high to begin with and dwindled even more after the Muggle Independence Wars of the 90s, there are only about a hundred children left attending. The institute focuses on studying Adriatic sea creatures such as dolphins and has a research / diplomacy outpost at nearby island Rab where there is a sizable population of Merpeople.

The quieter islands of Croatia, not inhabited by too many nosy Muggles, are a popular vacation destination for Wizards across Europe who love the pristine and clean beaches. The Wizarding population of these villages enjoys playing the unique sport of water-quidditch where enchanted racing boats are used in favor of brooms as a pastime, since there is not much free space available on the islands that is not covered in lush green forests.

And while I'm at it - let's take our neighbors from Switzerland. Their Magical Trades School is entirely subterranean, founded by Burgundians and Alemanns in the early 700s and gone undercover ever since the Franconian takeover.

It teaches a wild mixture of Goblin, Dwarvish and Human children everything from crude tasks such as mine works to the fine art of making magical clocks - the Swiss export is a worldwide bestseller, not to mention that the gold they manage to extract from the Alps. A fact they keep under close guard is that the gold ore is of a purity found nowhere else and easy to mine, allowing the early 1000s era of Goblins to establish the now worldwide dominating banking enterprise Gringotts.

The Swiss, just like the Muggles aboveground, prefer absolute neutrality and have stood neutrally for over a thousand years now, no matter which conflict - an attitude that kept them alive, yet mostly ignored by everyone else around them except for those who want a clock to keep track of time and family members. Another secret that no foreigner must ever learn of is that the Swiss society, not only neutral on the outside but also on the inside, sees all wielders of magic, no matter the species, the gender or the sexual orientation, as fully equal under the law - they all know the story of Human supremacists, being reminded too hard by witnessing from afar what horrors the two Austrians Gellert Grindelwald and Adolf Hitler had brought upon the world.

**** Yes, but they were only officially politically one country for 15 years, as they were only united in 1815. They have however, belonged to the same geographical locatation "de nederlanden" for millennia, and which consisted out of many duchies and townships such as Flanders, Brabant, Gelre, and Holland. " De Nederlanden" as an area has belonged to Spain and France at certain points.

Flanders has a long history as an independent/dependent duchy, so to have a magical school there predating the split would make sense imho. There could also be a separate one in Holland, Gelre or Brabant pre-split as there was a very different culture in the Northern Nederlanden vs the southern Nederlanden.

*** What we understand by school goes back to Roman / Greek traditions where the upper class had their children instructed by scholars / philosophers (rarely slaves as in films).\\
It was often several households that got together to attract the best scholars (more money) from there, the concept of the school developed.\\
Unless you want to include Atlantis or similar high cultures in a fic, "education" ran on in a master apprentice relationship for the majority of early history.\\
Something like scribes were e.g. Also more family jobs where son learns from father. It is implied that it was the same in the wizarding world before Hogwarts. Many even in aristocratic families were barely educated or could even read, this was often the case up until the Middle Ages.

** Italy here. We don't really have a centralised magic school because our country has been rather divided culturally and historically, and many wizards and witches study abroad.

I went to Alba Domus, a rather recent (end of the XVIII century) magic school situated in the Southern Alps. Alba Domus takes its name (that means "white home") from its proximity to a glaciers, and caters to the magical population of the Alps region and of Northern Italy. While not a world-renowed school, it's gotten a reputation for alternative education, integrating Muggle technology and science into its curriculum, and it's one of the few places in Europe where Squibs or siblings of Muggle-born children can get an education alongside their magical mates (even if with a different curriculum).

Another difference between Alba Domus and other schools is in its course structure. Pupils typically begin their studies at 6 years old (the Italian magical community has different rules about reaching out to Muggle-born children and about magic by minors) and stay there 10 to 13 years (depending on whether they pursue specialised training or not). The school provides all the ground education, not only in magical knowledge but also literacy, maths, science and humanities, and in the later years provides vocational or muggle-integrated training for those who want/need to pursue a job outside the magical community.

The reason for all this strangeness lies in the peculiar story of magical communities in the mountains. Because the population is so sparse there was never the opportunity for isolated magical communities to form, and so the life of a wizard or of a witch has always depended the mixed community. Then, in the XIX century the wars and political instability that pervaded Italy pushed many magical families to take refuge in the Alps, where they brought their knowledge that came from more urbanised parts of the country. This effect was exacerbated by the wars of the XX century, that lead to a new influx of refugees from the Northern Alps to Alba Domus.

So, what do I think about my school? I admit, at first I wanted to go to Beauxbatons, since it gives a much better magical education. However in the end I am very grateful to have gone to Alba Domus: the education I got, while not top-notch in any area, is very well-rounded and lacks the "blind spots" that I would have otherwise had (I know how to use a cell phone!). Now I have the means to get myself a decent life both in the magical and in the Muggle world, which I finding very useful since, given the small size and density of the magical community in there, it's basically impossible for me to live completely inside the magical world and get a magical job.

(P.S. Sorry for the papyrus, English is not my mother language and it's been forever since I last wrote something this long about non-technical topics. Hope you enjoyed the read!)

*** I disagree. My idea is that during the monarchy (Austria-Hungary or Austro-Hungarian Empire) the magical community of Austria and Hungary created a magical school. The Croats would most likely go to their own school considering their attitude towards the hungarians during that time. Since the Dual Monarchy was mostly centralized to the capital of Austria, Vienna, It would be logical to assume that the location of the magical school would be in equally close to Hungary and Austria. I believe the exact location would be the Esterházy-palace. The Mágusok és Varázslónők Akadémiája (=Academy of Mages and Enchantresses) would be financially supported partly by the Esterházy noble family and the Monarchy. The school's motto would be: Melius in posterum=For a better future. Since the population of the 2 country was not that high, I assume that the magical population wasn't high either. There would be only around 100 students, and the length of the educational schooling would be 10 years. Since there is so few students each year, they would not get letters from the school, but a Professor would visit the magical children's family.

The school priorities about the subjects would most likely be Combat Magic (given the fact, that the Dual Monarchy had a quite big army, and the queen wanted to create a magical batallion), Dark Arts (which is different from Combat Magic. Combat Magic is mostly dodging spells and duelling, while Dark Arts would be the class about the spells.)Transfiguration, Enchanting, there would be a whole year sillabus of Blood Magic (most likely in year 9), Magical Creatures (mostly merpeople and other creatures in the Neusiedler Sea), Warding, Runes, but there would be more subjects.

After the Dual Monarchy and the Second World War, the soviets would not continue to maintain the school, and they would close it. The magical families would educate their children and after the 20th century, the wizarding families sent their children to foriegn magical schools (In Transylvania, Italy, and in extreme conditions Russia).

** I live in Finland. In Finnish folklore there's this one really famous wizard, Väinämöinen.

In the folklore hes basically an immortal demigod that came from the start of the world.

In my world he lived in a random village somewhere. The people in there worshipped him as a person of godlike status. He had a school for all children. When christianity came and people stopped believing he was a god, he'd leave the non magicals, leaving only the magicals as his students. He'd travel around with children picking up other magical children on their travels. His teaching would be pretty random with him just teaching what comes to his head. When the children got old enough, they'd leave to fill the gaps in their knowledge left by his erratic teaching.

I also made an explanation for his immortality that works better with the HP lore. This story is largely based on the story of Sampo in Kalevala. I changed a lot though, so don't take this as the definitive version of the story of Sampo.

Väinämöinen had a friend, Ilmarinen the smith and together they made a Sampo, which would be an older version of the philosopher's stone. Ilmarinen struck a deal with a famous witch named Louhi: in exchange for the Sampo, he'd get her daughter. Louhi took the Sampo, but didn't give her daughter. When Ilmarinen told Väinämöinen about the deal, Väinämöinen killed Ilmarinen for stealing the Sampo and selling it without his knowledge. Then Väinämöinen went to retrieve the Sampo back and had a big fight with Louhi. He won, but the Sampo was destroyed during the fight. Väinämöinen tried to get all the pieces and ended up absorbing them through his wounds that he got in the battle. This left him immortal.

** I'm from Brazil, so there is Castelobruxo, the wizarding school created by J.K. but which can't be taken very seriously since it says it's for a bunch of South America countries and there is an obvious language barrier there... Also, Brazil is a huge ass country, there is no way only one school would be able to deal with all of it alone, EVEN LESS other countries together with Brazil.

So we have Renata Ventura's book A Arma Escarlate, that is set in the wizarding world but here in Brazil and she has created our wizarding school and it is AWESOME.

We have five schools, one for each region of tje country (North, Northeast, Middlewest, Southeast and South), each of these regions have strong unique cultures, so it's totally suitable that each has it's own school. The five of them are integrated and together they form the Pentagon; they were meant to be built in specific places that drew a pentagon if traced in the map.

There are three books out (out of five) but I've only read two this far, so I only know the Southeast school ---called Nossa Senhora do Corcovado--- and the Northeast (where I live so my school!!) school ---called Cidade Média.

Nossa Senhora do Corcovado: Located inside the Corcovado, as the name suggests. Includes a forest, a beach, various fun rooms like The Rooms of Tears, that takes you to whatever place/scene will make you cry; the corridor of the signs, that is decorated with sun sign stones that follow you and shout your horoscope at you insistently; a room that takes you to a place in which you feel comfortable; etc. Sadly, it believes in following European standards evwn if they don't apply at all to our reality, lile clothing and stuff. That is one of the major plot points of the series.

Cidade Média: Located in Bahia, its entrance is the Lacerda Elevator. There the afrobrazilian culture prevails, the school is like a huge camp, with many huts, some for dorms, which divide students according to their Orisha parent, some for classrooms, etc.

The school is located in the Cordoba Mountains (a famous "UFO" spotting place) and features a mix of Spanish Mudejar/Herrarian and colonial styles after the most recognized artistic periods in Argentina's architectural history.

** Based on a small fic-snippet I wrote for a homework assignment on the main HP subreddit, I have a personal head canon that up until about 1996, most norwegian wizards would attend Durmstrang, which is indeed located in Norway in this scenario, but in 1996. a norwegian wizard named Arthur Arnfinn Brovrese, who served as DADA teacher at hogwarts one year, came back to Norway and started a new norwegian wizarding school inside tunnels of a mountain near his hometown of Mosjøen.

It's name is "Øyfjellet Høyere Skole for Hekseri og Trolldom" (Øyfjellet School of Witchcraft and Wizardry) and the classes and curriculum is heavily inspired by Hogwarts. After being started in 1996, with a relatively small first class, the number of students steadily grew until it eventually replaced Durmstrang as the school most norwegian wizards attend. Much of this is because the school's location is close to the exat geographic centre-point of Norway, so for many people it's easier to send their children there, insted of even further up north to Durmstrang. And unlike Durmstrang, Øyfjellet also accepts muggleborns.

EDIT - If one assumes that the typical muggle-to-wizard ratio is 4150 to 1, which is what I think is most likely, an important thing to note is that it realistically would not be feasible for Norway to have its own seperate wizarding school until arounf this time, so I think its founding in 1996 makes sense.

EDIT 2 - I f anyone wants to read the story I wrote about Arthur Arnfinn Brovrese, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/5limgo/january_assignment_dada_professor_histories/dc4kb0y/][here's the link.]]

** Twardovsky's Uniersity of Magyckal Arts. Country of origin: Poland.

See, Mr. Twardowski was one of the finest wizard's in our history, a figure so well known he still remains in muggle memory even to this day as a semi-legendary figure, despite living in times when Statute of Secrecy was raised.

But, as proper of a Polish nobleman of the time, the man had style and grandeur, and wasn't content with half-assing things, and wanted to be well-remembered. So, as a proof of his prowess and fantasy (and a bit of a need to show-off), he took on a quest like no other, and succeeded. He even took some friends from a local pub to see his grand creation, but due to unfortunate 'theatrics' of using floo powder it gave birth to the first half of his legend - that he was abducted by the Devil himself for fooling him on a deal.

So, what's the other part of his legend, you may ask? Well, the tale goes that the Devil dropped him on the Moon. That part, at least, proved true, for that was the location he envisioned for a perfect place of education. After all, if you can do it, then why the hell not?

The school, for obvious reasons, excels in the Astronomy deprtment, and also in duelling - after all, there are few more proper ways of settling disputes between equals than a duel, so it's expected of every wizard worth his salt to know how to duel. Nobiless oblige, and all that.

While most places are enchanted to simulate gravitational effect, the staircases are not - there are a few bars that you can grab (for younger student) and a lot of space, and you resort to jumping. Got to make use of that nice 1/6th g up there.

Due to the stricter laws in the states - immigration and otherwise - and the obvious political tension, The Havana School Of Magical Excellence has steadily grown into the premiere school for witchcraft, wizardry and Voodoo in Central America.

Because of its central location, rich magical culture, and courses offered in both English and Spanish, the Havana S.O.M.E draws students from all the countries and states that surround it - from the island nations of the Caribbean Sea to the continental Central American countries - the ones that either are too far from the Mexican school of magic or choose Cuba instead. And of course we can't forgot the students from Louisiana and the southern states, for whom it has been tradition to study in Cuba ever since slavery in the US ended.

Yes, with its ethnically rich student body, proud history and excellent teachers - and of course the beautiful weather - The Havana S.O.M.E. sounds like a wonderful place to spend your teen years learning magic.

** A fellow Austrian? Sers, Oida.

I wrote an Austrian school too, back in the days.

The Studiorum Iuvavum - founded by the Romans who settled at the Salzach river, its a school built deep within the Untersberg mountains. The original construction was commissioned. Dwarves built the caverns and halls, and trapped many of them against prying eyes. It was long seen as an university / research outpost to study the magics developed further north by germanic and norse tribes. Much like the city of Iuvavum, the Studiorum grew in size and importance during the centuries. The many celtic and bajuvarian influences also found more ears and practitioners as Rome slowly, but surely, lost its grip on its empire.

While the roman empire fell, the university adapted itself to become a steadfast fortress and refuge for the few academics and/or wizards that didn't make a run for it to Byzanz or Baghdad, tough all it could really do was keep knowledge alive. True progress was effectively halted for centuries.

It would be so until Charlemagne designated it as one of many schools for his growing army of wizards and witches. However, it would always remain slightly /elite/ oriented, and still refused to teach children, fully defending its stance that the basics should be learned from parents or masters.

This changed in the eleventh century when the, by then, eternal headmaster Charlemagne [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Untersberg][(derived from the myth that charlemagne sleeps in his grave in the Untersberg)]] heard of the success of Hogwarts, and the many tales of its four Founders. Having a professional respect for Rowena Ravenclaw, he asked the scottish witch to help him build something similar in the Untersberg. Rowena did so - spent a few months there - and built what is now known as the "Schola et Studiorum Iuvavum".

Over many centuries the SeSI taught young wizards and witches the Arts of magic. However, its admission was never high. At its peak during the Inquisition that started around 1200, it harbored around 600 students. To note is also that these students did not, as in Hogwarts, graduate after 7 years of schooling. SeSI students commited to 20 years of magical studies, with the utmost importance being progress in obscure magics, like Time, Soul, Hatred and Love. Thats boiled down to around 30 handpicked students per year.

This eliterianism got more pronounced as Durmstrang, and other schools of magic teaching in the various German dialects, popped up. SeSI sent those "with little promise" to Durmstrang or other schools. At its lowest, SeSI took in 5 students per year, and trained them to become absolute beasts of magic - sometimes literally. This manic push to absolute excellence created some of the greatest wizards and witches in history - good and bad.

The Studiorum experienced a massive hit during the Grindelwald war, killing a good half of its faculty, and weakening Charlemagne himself for decades to come. As The second Voldemort war rages across the UK, SeSI is gathering funds and willing personell to once more begin the training of legends.

I'm just not a fan of "Merlin factories" but to each their own.

But I get the appeal at first I wanted to imagine the Austrian School to be one of the best in the World with a focus on Transfiguration and the only reason why they don't appear in canon is that the Austrian Wizards live in total isolation but then I thought that would not be interesting. Austria's history would be completely ignored and Hogwarts would be sidelined to a second-rate Wizarding school that somehow gets to claim to be the best in Europe even though there is my OP school.

**** I definitely didn't write it as a Merlin factory. I imagined it more like "the expectation of the school" is an Alastor Moody, or Kingsley Shacklebolt, and plenty fell below that expectation.

But of course, they chugged out their fair share of those, and of Herpos, Snapes and Tom Riddles.

In my mind it was a Department of Mysteries that educated its own Unspeakables. It didn't really compete with Hogwarts, because its focus was entirely different, and I'm pretty sure I had this even stated by Charlemagne in the few tidbits I wrote about it. The era I wrote it in - about 1890 - still had them redirect most of their applicants to Durmstrang, Beauxbatons,...

The actual "austrian" schools in that fic were scattered around the Habsburg Empire, as wizards simply didn't really acknowledge the fall of the empire, given that they practically seceded from muggle nations in 1689 with the Statute of Secrecy. The muggles had a WW1 that broke the Empire. The wizards didn't.

Founded to educate Catholic witches and wizards during the time of the Catholic Penal Laws, this magical university was originally a "hedge school".

Along with its Irish Muggle university counterparts, Coláiste na Draíochta has grown rapidly in recent decades and now educates wizards of all religions (and those with no religion, of course) from all over the world.

** Well I'm French, as you know, we already have Beauxbâtons. That's where I went myself.

But there's a few other schools that people don't talk about much.

- There's a school in Corsica, because Wizards there are very insular, barely acknowledge that they are in fact French, and don't want to sent their kids to The Continent. So they have their own school, Corsica School of Prophecy, based on their own culture.

They don't call themselves wizards, but Mazzeru (Or Mazzera for women). I really don't know a lot about them. Mazzera are oftentimes considered Dark, because they deal with Necromancy a lot. Their Nickname "Death Messenger", doesn't help them a lot. They're also mostly active at night, so there is that.

- Magical French kids from French Carrabeans isles, along with Guyana and Saint-Pierre and Miquelon goes to a School, that is in the middle of the Atlantics Not too far from Bermuda as far as I can tell.

This school of Magic is the base of a lot of myths around the world, as it goes by the name of Atlantis, but really, it's just a bunch of kids trying to learn magic, and sometimes things get out of hands, and muggles sees things they shouldn't see, and they tell stories. And yeah, there's planes and ships that might have disappear because of them. Sorry about that.

- Magical French Kids from the Pacific Islands goes to another school in the Pacific, again no ones know exactly were. A lot of ancestral magic is going on there. We actually consider it the best school when it comes to communion with nature, and respect to old magic.

- Magical French Kids from the Indian Ocean Islands are sadly still not enough to open a school just for them. Most parents choose to sent them to The Magical School in Madagascar. I let someone from there talk about it.

** Switzerland 🇨🇭: Schwyzer Magische Schule

It's situated in Kanton Schwyz and It's hidden in one of the forests, although Switzerland is rather small it is counted as a good school. The school has all the normal subject, but specialises in Herbology as it is in a Forest. Compared to Hogwarts though their second best subject is History, they also teach politics. Politics in Switzerland is a big thing as it is a direct democracy, so to be prepared for the future the students learn that as well.

As the Swiss are Neutral and strongly so, the would not only accept Humans but all creatures. The Swiss are traditionalists and grew up with magical stories even muggle children (know that from own experience). So everyone is more accepting and so they let everyone in their school. Everyone in their school are also equals as it is a Swiss school and the Swiss are strong neutralises.

That means that growing up with centaurs, goblins, elves and other creatures make them more connecting with nature. That is also why the are spécialists in Herbology, they are also more accepting that other countries. This does have a down side though because the Swiss find it harder to change their views on certain things. (This comes forward in the fact that a certain Kanton only let women vote in 1992.)

They are however more accepting to technology. (Now I know things blow up around magic, but I am talking about scrolls and quills) The Swiss like to live comfortably and not make their own life difficult. A lot of people like it simple in this community.

What does not make them the greatest school in a lot of peoples views, is that they are not blood-purists. They also don't have the best teachers in charms and other subjects. Where as Hogwarts as the best teachers in all practily subjects.

** Such detailed answers, lol. I'm in the US, so canon says we have Ilvermorney, but given the sheer size of the US that doesn't make much sense. I'll take it a step further than just population though: we see that the major events in real world history happen in the Wizarding World too.

Which means...no Black children, free or slave, are going to study at Ilvermorney. That is not going to fly with a lot of people. So most of the early education would have been via informal homeschooling. It would have needed to be particularly discreet on plantations, since there was already an effort to "save" the slaves. Eventually though, you'd see a few small schools start to form in the same manner as historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) did here in the US. Maybe one or two would be in old maroon communities There would be fierce rivalries among them but it's all in love. There'd be an urgency to protect them as well, since, like HBCUs in real life, they tend to receive less funding and support on average.

In terms of the magic they'd teach, it would be all over the place. Enslaved Africans in the US came from such a wide area of Central and West Africa, over such an extended period of time. You'd need to account for how practice would have changed as each group came from the continent, as well as those that went from the continent to the Caribbean before coming here. I'd like to think that one place they'd shine is healing. That after the horrors and legacy of slavery, they became the experts not just in healing physical ailments but mental and emotional too. These would be the ones at the forefront of the "whole body" philosophy, where the overall health of a wizard affects his ability to perform magic, or the ones pioneering spells the equivalent of reconstructive surgery.

The schools would probably still contribute a ton towards the culture - people and innovations in art, music, fashion, and food. They'd have some of the top athletes, and the best sports healing program to boot. They would also have a great reputation for civil rights activists in the magical world.

But yeah, that's where most Black American wizarding children end up. You might see some at other schools with more prestige/name recognition and funding opportunities, like Ilvermorney, particularly if they are mixed or are recent immigrants from the continent or other parts of the diaspora. But overall this would be our thing.

*** I was thinking along the same lines, but because of that history maybe you'd end up with rival schools very geographically close together. Like a Baltimore School and a Washington DC school, or even just two schools within the same city that have never combined because its traditional to keep them separate.

** 1. With the proportion 5000:1 between Muggles and wizards, it is hard to imagine separate schools for every current country. However, it might be true, that wizards don't follow all divisions of Muggle countries, and then we would be talking about Heiliges Römisches Reich (which was in existence when The Statute of Secrecy was enacted) and then there would be one school for all German speaking countries (and perhaps even my Czechia).

2. Immediately contradicting myself, there is a group of Czech writers around the server [[http://budec.net][Budeč]], who envision hidden Czech magical school at [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bude%C4%8D_(Kladno_District][Budeč]]) where was early Czech settlement in the late 9th and early 10th century, and where Saint Wenceslaus (patron-saint of Bohemia) is said to study in school. Muggle historian claim the settlement was abandoned in rush after Saint Wenceslaus was killed in 935 (there are even archaeological excavations supporting that), but we know what the true story is: wizards hid their school when their protector (and alumni of the school) died and stopped protecting them. The series of stories include (in Czech, of course) wonderful story combining late-Communist milieu with magic. It is very good. Their stories include the existence of German magical school hidden somewhere in the Harz mountains.

** I come from Poland, so I'm not sure if that would work for us. Overall we're a pretty fucked up country so I guess there would be a couple of schools.

I am already playing around with the idea of ​​setting up a seven-year elementary school somewhere near Krakow, where you have been attending since the age of seven, there are no houses or rivalries, except for Quidditch and games such as chess or competitions typical of Muggle schools, such as basketball, volleyball etc. There is absolutely no tolerance for any signs of intimidation out of "blood". However, there may be times when professors fail to notice the usual emotional intimidation. I was playing with the name Magical Grues Primary School.

After these seven schools, you can join five different schools, each specializing in different things. For example, the Guźce Training Academy, dealt with divination (for true Seers), Astronomy and Transmutation, the Magic School Institute, Defense Against the Dark Arts, Black Magic and the nature of protective spells and ancient magical languages. Lupus Seminar is open to several types of magic, here students learn to recognize the signature of the power, study Light, Gray, Dark and Neutral magic, as well as more advanced healing potions. ASINUS Junior High School is probably the most demanding school. In order to get there, you have to pass all the tests practically perfectly at the end of the sixth and seventh year of elementary school. This is where some of the most powerful wizards in Poland end. You learn advanced there: Defense Against the Dark Arts, Transfiguration, Potions, Astronomy, Runes and most importantly, all kinds of magic that exist, but mostly Ancient and Modern. The fifth school is rather a hidden Muggle school, there are people who cannot afford such inflated tastes because they may have a difficult time or are poor, or some of them are orphans. There they are prepared to continue living in a Muggle environment, and teachers make sure that they are also keeping up with the curriculum in the wizarding world. In fact, they study a bit of everything there.

However, most of them have a very strange position, for example:

- Guźce Training Academy is located deep in the Baltic Sea, some 200 kilometers from Gdańsk

- Magic School Institute is deep in the Noteć forest, where it is covered with great amounts of spells

- Lupus Seminar, is hidden in the mountains, somewhere in the undiscovered range of the Carpathians

- ASINUS Junior High School is located in the very center of Warsaw in the Palace of Culture and Science

- And a hidden Wizarding school for Muggles and wizards is in Gorzów Wielkopolski

So far that's it. I siema polacy jeśli to czytacie! To znaczy że tak jak ja się nudzicie i dryfujecie po internecie, więc życzę wam powodzenia.

** Since Indonesia has so many culture, they have their own magical cult. If I reduce it, general terms of our mystic arts (MA) is: invincibility, transformation, taming fantastic & mythical beasts, defence against dark arts, herbology,what is mystical creatures: how to contact, summon, contract and not to be fooled by them,homing melee weapon, enlargement vital organ, prosperity magic, love magic, knowing "mbaurekso" (the oldest & strongest mythical creature) in your area, windstep (teleportation), clone yourself (able to be in several places in same time), and of course, weathery 101.

** I'm in the US. We have Illvermony but I'm going to disregard that.

I would say there are at least 4 schools, one in each region. West coast but instead of California which I the popular opinion, I would opt for somewhere in Washington or Oregon. In the mountains somewhere hidden.

Then there would be a school located in the South, like Texas or New Mexico. In the desert possibly.

Next, in the Midwest would be my favorite location. I'm a Chicagoan so the magic school here would definitely have to be hidden in plain sight in either the John Hancock building or the Sears Tower.

Finally, on the east coast, I like the idea of housing magical school in Rhode Island because it's so tiny and unassuming. Seriously. Hogwarts is probably bigger than Rhode Island but it's all good.

** Well I am czech. As you are Austrian, I suppose you know czech. :)

We actually had the wizarding school in 1971 movie called Girl on broomstick but most notably known as Saxana, the Witch. In that movie, the location of wizarding school was not clear but it seemed as underground and was entred by a well on square. The quite original feature of this school is that it was more inclusive than just human centred. Various other inteligent magical species studied there alongside witches and wizards and they even had courses for those specific students. .

The name is not mentioned so I am going to create one: Čarosklep

Btw I you want to watch the movie you could possibly find it in german dubbing as there is a short part with german dubing on youtube. It is fun and considered czech clasic.

***** Yes, the church and the cemetery is on the edge of the former gord (hradiště). That plain in front of the church? Yes, that was the Slavic gord, which was (according to the Muggle archaeologists) swiftly abandoned sometime after the death of Saint Wenceslaus. There is even a mass grave at Budeč with what looks the whole castle garrison bodies; and there is even a literary evidence that Boleslaus got killed whole Prague garrison supposedly faithful to Wenceslaus.
