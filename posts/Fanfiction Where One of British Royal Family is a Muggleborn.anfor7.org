I've read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10556030/9/Royal-Ward][Royal Ward]] a few months ago and felt dissapointed since Harry only get some visit and some funds from the crown. I'm expecting Harry will grow around the crown and become childhood friend with Prince Harry and Prince William.

I wanted to read a fic where someone from British Royal Family is magical and accepted to Hogwarts. How will they manage to integrate to another society where they're basically no one? How will the purebloods react to them and how will they respond? Will the Queen realise one of Her family member is magical early and will they get some pre-Hogwarts magical education? How will they react to the threat of Voldemort?

The possibilites are endless.

​

Note: I'm not even remotely British, heck English isn't even my native language. If there's any misconception about British Royal it's solely my mistake.


** Kind of a morbid thought, but what about a story where Princess Diana was secretly helping smuggle muggleborns away before the coming school year when the corrupt Ministry of Magic made school attendance mandatory and was killed by Voldemort? She died on August 31, 1997, the day before the start of school for the timeframe of the Deathly Hallows, basically a month after the Ministry had fallen. Maybe even a Muggle liaison to the Order and a friend of Dumbledore?

*** Deep down in many rabbit holes of linkffn(7211094) there is something like it. I still don't know what to think about the story. On the hand, it is very good, because it finally acknowledges that people have grandparents (how many of you have living grandparents? how many grandparents there are in HP canon?), but it is so overcomplicated that it looses most mojo with me. Not sure.

** I don't recall exactly which one it is, but there's a story which should be a multiple Cliche Bingo winner - Harry has a soul bond with Hermione... and Daphne; Harry and the witches are sent back through time ("to right what once went wrong..." wait a minute, that's the wrong franchise), they get Sirius released, Pettigrew captured, the Longbottoms cured, etc.

Anyway, one plot point almost lost in the crowd, has Justin Finch-Fletchly as Viscount Lonsdale, his father Earl Bedford, and his grandfather Duke of Kendal. Those titles, in particular the one for Kendal, to quote Wikipedia, "have been created several times, usually for people with some connection to the royal family."

** There is plenty of “Queen Elizabeth takes over and resolves all problems using muggleborn UK Army units" stories. I really like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11500936/1/Long-Live-The-Queen][https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11500936/]] which is kind of straightforward implementation of the idea. And just now I finished reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6652537/1/Quoth-the-Raven-Nevermore][https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6652537/]] and I am not too excited about it.

Generally I think JKR canon universe is very bourgeois and it is possible that in very closed community some kind of hereditary aristocracy could develop, it really doesn't sound well when students in Hogwarts call themselves "Lord SoandSo" and "Heiress Whatever". It just doesn't fit. Aside from Quoth the Raven promises a lot of gore and blood and in the end it basically has no climax whatsoever, it just drowns in all Lords and aristocratic junk.

That was also one of many reasons why I haven't enjoyed "Royal Ward" much.

*** I totally agree that idea's overdone. But, one implementation I still like is linkffn(11961978). It's got an excellently-done unique hook to get the Muggle government involved, and then it continues with some nice touches but without dragging on.

  Major Non-Canon A/U, Harry is treated for abuse and massive injuries by John Watson as a John Doe. To help solve the mystery of the battered boy John calls in his partner Sherlock - whose father has much more information about his patient than John ever thought possible. Turning to an old acquaintance, Siger Holmes contacts the Lord of the Most Ancient and Noble House of Wallace...Harry's rightful guardian.First several chapters will be covering Pre-Hogwarts years, story starts with Harry at age four so it'll be a while before any sort of slash or real conflict happens. Very political fic with lots of twists and turns. Because the plot-bunnies won't leave me alone!
