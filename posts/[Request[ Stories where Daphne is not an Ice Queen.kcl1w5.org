I want to actually start looking into the Harry/Daphne ship but i'm not exactly an Ice Queen character type fan. I do however like the idea genuinely falling for just a good Slytherin and seeing what happens with that. So my request isgood Harry/Daphne fics where she's not an ice queen (or even just fics where they are really good friends).

I want to actually start looking into the Harry/Daphne ship but i'm not exactly an Ice Queen character type fan. I do however like the idea genuinely falling for just a good Slytherin and seeing what happens with that. So my request is good Harry/Daphne fics where she's not an ice queen (or even just fics where they are really good friends).


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/8431550/Dorothea-Greengrass][FFN author Dorothea Greengrass]] has several Haphne fics that don't follow the Ice Queen trope for Daphne. Not all of them are complete yet though. The first one below is complete and the second one has the primary storyline that is mostly finished:

"[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12849376/1/A-Marriage-of-Convenience][A Marriage of Convenience]]" involves a marriage contract and a crazy Ginny linkffn(12849376)

"[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12300252/1/From-Southampton-to-New-York-and-Beyond][From Southampton to New York and Beyond]]" sees Harry and Daphne meet on a cruise as they are both recovering from trauma. linkffn(12300252)

I'm currently reading "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12155794/1/Honour-Thy-Blood][Honor Thy Blood]]", which has been pretty good. The version of Daphne in this story is not an Ice Queen, but is more of a supporting character, so it may not be what you are looking for. linkffn(12155794)

Lastly, two of my favorite Daphne Greengrass stories:

1. "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13133746/1/Daphne-Greengrass-and-the-Importance-of-Intent][Daphne Greengrass and the Importance of Intent]]". linkffn(13133746)

** Purebloods and Laser Guns: linkao3(27755167)

Daphne is playful, friendly, and a Muggle enthusiast (like a less-ridiculous Arthur Weasley). She's still a Slytherin though, as evidenced by her strategies during a game of laser-tag.

Ice Cream: linkao3(19397077)

A slightly different (and adorable) interpretation of Ice Queen Daphne. She's an ice-cream enthusiast and exhibits some signs of being on the autism spectrum - most predominantly, misreading social cues and situations.

ADDENDUM: Found another good one. The Lion Tamer: linkffn(6311215)

EDIT: Did I just recommend an author's own fic to them? Yes, yes I did. Whoops!

** Have you considered a Harry/Tracy? Daphne as an ice queen is so ingrained in people by now that's hard to find anything where Daphne is not an Ice Queen. Tracy is usually done as more Quidditch prone ESTP or ISTP friend, which might be more canon Harry's type to be honest.

At the end their both just names, blank slates, and if you're looking for a good Slytherin it might be irrelevant whose name is there.

And that's mainly just because of my own fic's Daphne. (Slightly aloof but genuinely and openly nice, muggle loving and more then happy to tease her friends but stand up for them without hesitation.)

  AU: When Voldemort attacked the Potters on Halloween night, she not only created a living legend in Charlus Potter, the Boy-Who-Lived, but she touched the life of another just as deeply. What will happen when a more jaded, more focused, and more gifted Harry Potter shows up at Hogwarts in 1991 after being abandoned and forgotten? Fem!Voldemort, WBWL

  This is the story of how Voldemort and the tools he created to defy death were destroyed by Harry Potter and me while sitting in an empty Hogwarts classroom using Harry's idea, my design, and most importantly, our intent. Set during 6th Year.

#+begin_quote
  Last Heirs of noble bloodlines are forced to marry in order to prevent wizards from becoming extinct thanks to a new law passed by the Ministry in order to distract the public from listening to Dumbledore's warnings of Voldemort's return. Rated M, so once again if you are easily offended, just don't read it.

  Complete. During Chamber of Secrets, Harry finds a friend in someone he'd never thought about before. That was the beginning of an experience that opened his eyes to what he had been missing.

#+begin_quote
  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.
