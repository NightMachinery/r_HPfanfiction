Looking for fics where Harry becomes really good at dueling while at Hogwarts (though not OP). Would appreciate if it also has him take other student(s) under his wing and he/they get a moment where their skills get a time to shine (most preferably in the graveyard or DoM).


** He is a great duelist in linkffn(The Merging) but no apprentices and he is a good duelist post Hogwarts who teaches a dueling class in linkffn(Altered Destinies).

  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway. Somehow surviving, the mystery remains unanswered as the new year draws closer, buried by the looming conflict the Order scrambles to prepare for. Buried by the prospect of his toughest year at Hogwarts yet. In the face of his fate, what can he do but keep moving forwards?

*** Even though that isn't the right story(Altered Destinies), you should definitely check it out! Used to read tons of PJ fanfiction before coming here and if I remember correctly it is a decent story.
