** I find there is too much weird 'romance' going on in every fandom, I generally don't enjoy reading stories whose main plot point is the pairing. Having said that the beauty of fanfiction is exploring the setting in a new way and if reading about it gives people enjoyment I really don't care that it exists. Personally my main irritation stems from the fact that people mislead with the tagging of their stories making them harder to filter out.

Filtered out it's something like a third of all completed stories over 20k words.

Doesn't sound like it, dude.

Speaking as an occasional Tomarry fan, it really just depends on the author. Some authors manage to pull it off in a way that's intriguing and... well, not believable, but shippable. It's not about the 'pedophile like kink' (for me, at least), but more about reading how the relationship dynamics play out. I'm often aware, intellectually, that the relationship is actually a very unhealthy one or one that is simply never going to happen if we go by the characters' actual canon personalities. If it occurred in real life (although chances of a former Dark Lord getting together with a decades-younger wizard is pretty slim), I'd probably condemn it. But the point is that it's a /story./ It's not an actual reflection of the readers' values or ethics that they like to read such stories.

Look at it from a different perspective. Plenty of people like to read about how evil Harry joins the Dark Lord and kills Muggles because he's been abused by Muggles. If this occurred irl, where an abused orphan goes around killing a whole bunch of people in often gruesome and ruthless ways, it would probably be condemned by the very same people who read those sort of fics.

So to sum it up, it's just fiction. No one is 'sick' or pedophilic because they like to read about made up characters being in relationships with other made up characters.

****** As I said, I mostly like the dynamics of it. It's a bit hard to pinpoint what exactly, but I suppose it's something about how the authors (some) play with the inevitable conflict between Tom's general evilness with Harry's goodness, either by having Tom compromise out of affection for Harry or having Harry slowly 'corrupted' by Tom. There's a strange (and deeply unhealthy) sort of power play underlying the relationship which I find really fascinating and enjoy reading about. It's probably also in part the romanticised idea of 'saving' an evil person with love, or at least the way that trope is played upon and in some ways, undermined.

**** Dude you're hostile from the beginning. How do you want people to want to explain to you why they like something when you're already dead set on disliking it. You just sound like someone who wants to trash talk people for liking something, not like you're ready for any kind of meaningful discussion.

So why would anyone want to engage with you when you've already decided that their preferences was sick and disgusting from the start.

That you find it vile is your choice, and your preference and it's fine. I'm not much à harry/snape person, but a well done time-travel harry/riddle that removes the age gap problem, or a harry/riddle mentor relationship, I'm all the way in. I like what it deals with. The taboo, first, of being in love with your mortal enemy. The corruption of Harry becoming dark. The dark arts, the betrayal and the cover they have to play. Or sometimes, just the downright insane. That's what I like the most and often time they come with a harry/voldemort pairing that I chose to ignore or that I chose to like, however it is portrayed.

Your judgment of other people's choice is wrong. That you find it vile isn't.

- Bellatrix served 13 years in Azkaban for her crimes, while Snape and Draco did no time. Therefore she is more absolved for her actions than either of them.

My disgust does not apply, becasue their male, as a matter of fact i'd love if Harry/Neville stories were more popular. My disgust is based upon both their age, and the impact they've had on Harry's life, which has been largely negative before he even joined Hogwarts. This goes double for Bellatrix, because she is actually insane, and has a vile, disgusting, cruel personality.

Also Draco I wouldn't even consider a cruel person, he hates Voldemort, and would rather he never came back, sure he was a racist, and a bully, but he was also young. If Harry got together with Draco before fourth year in a believable way, I wouldn't hate it.

**** That's why I asked what the appeal in Harry/Bellatrix was, since there are many supporters of it here compared to Harry/Draco or Harry/Snape, which get instantly downvoted if someone asks for recommendations.

Somehow Bellatrix's evilness is cool and sexy, or people haven't read canon in years so they believe the fanon explanation that the hereditary Black instability + strict pureblood upbringing + arranged marriage to a dirtbag = turned Bellatrix into an evil bitch, but she can be redeemed into a Woobie Dreamgirl by Harry's magical love powers.

I am not a whole fan of this explanation that I commonly see, where because Bellatrix is insane, she has less responsibility or accountability for her crimes than Snape or Draco, and therefore more redeemability. Mental illness isn't an excuse for criminal behavior. If that were the case, then motherfucking /Voldemort/ would have a Get Out of Jail Free card for his mental illness. (He has the Gaunt instability, deprived and neglectful childhood raised in a WWII orphanage, and spent 13 years floating around without a body, and JKR commentary called him a "psychopath", which is a legitimate neurological disorder.)

Its sorta like the drarry pairing but a step further. I suppose I always liked the trope were enemys get together and harry and tom want to kill eachother so... I end up wanting them to be together.

I dont normally read snarry but I know it can be pretty popular because of the whole mentor/stdent relationship potential they could have had if snake only got over his past with harry's parents.

A lot of people like the thought of forbidden teacher student relationships either durring school of after the student graduates.(very common trope in shojo manga) as harry and snape(out of all the teachers in Hogwarts) have the most potential for growth in their relationship (romantic or otherwise) it attracts alot of interest in fans.

I think that should conclude my explaination on why the pairings have popularity but to each their own. I myself dont like pairing hermione with anyone other than ron so I can understand that there are others who cant stand certain pairings such as tomarry or snarry.

I mean seriously, you've got magic and dragons and souls and hogwarts to play with and you go "nah I want to write a trite, overdramatic "romance" between two characters that never spoke two positive words to one another, have nothing that would make them compatible with each other, often aren't even fleshed out in canon besides a name, from a series where the romance was almost entirely an afterthought"

Not all shipping stories contain sex. Many focus on the other aspects of a relationship (character growth, humor, emotional closeness, trust, support, etc). Of course, not everyone enjoys stories about romance. To each their own.

It's an old joke that fanfic writers will pair anything that moves (and even some things that don't). <[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCDgJiPBxfI][relevant song]]> Personally I think it's astounding how people's imaginations lead them in vastly different directions when it comes to writing fanfic.

As for pairing good characters with bad characters, that's a common trope even outside of fanfiction and even outside of the romance genre. The [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsSexy][TVTropes page]] has a plethora of examples.

If that was actually how the Voldemort/Harry plots went in fanfiction then I'd agree it makes no sense. But each fic with that pairing diverges from cannon in different ways to engineer more plausible circumstances which aren't that ridiculously abrupt.

In some cases there's time travel to before Riddle committed the unforgivable acts of evil. In other cases the fic author writes an AU in which Voldemort wasn't as homicidally irrational as in cannon. Point being, it may seem bizarre to pair anyone with Voldemort, but when written by a skilled author the plot doesn't have to be as cracky as your quote.

** I can't explain why everyone else likes it, but I can explain why I do (as a 19 year old female). In just about every story I've read or T.V. show I've watched, I'm secretly cheering on the bad guy. People like Voldemort, Loki, or Cato (from Hunger Games). And the more I've thought about it, it boils down to:

Good girls like bad boys. It's the oldest trope in the book, which is why there are so many of them.

Based on your comments, here is some clarification.

It's not pedophilia. Harry is often well past puberty. Also, your looking at it from the wrong perspective. I suppose if you were relating more to Snape/Voldemort, it could be pedophilia, but that typically isn't the case. When reading these stories, I superimpose myself onto Harry, and it is well documented that [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_disparity_in_sexual_relationships][younger women prefer older males]]. In real life, the perfect boyfriend for me is a 30 year old with his own apartment and stable job. Snape is only 38. Concerning Snape, the relationship isn't sick because of the age-difference. That's relatively normal. (And don't say it's daddy issues. My dad is 65. Snape is no where near that).

With Voldemort, his appearance means that his age is hard to pin point, so I never get the vibe that he's 70. Also, his appearance was never that big of a deal, at least for me. It was more than made up by the fact he was powerful. And power is very, ** very ** attractive. In the primate-mate part of my brain, there is no doubt in my mind that he could protect me if he so decided.

More specifically on the Harry\Voldemort thing:

When reading stories, I'm tired of the good guys always winning and everything returning to the status quo. I want chaos. I want disaster. I want passion. I want something that challenges everything I've ever known and keeps me on my toes. Day in and day out, I'm good and I do everything that's expected of me, but sometimes I want to be bad. I want to break the rules. I want to read about someone who just doesn't care because all day I'm caring about other people and I'm tired. I want something new. I want to be bad.

I don't want someone who looks at me like a breakable doll. I want someone who fights me, who challenges me, who isn't afraid of hurting me because I can take it. Also, I want someone who's obsessed with me, someone who will put me above all others. Someone who will protect me, spoil me, burn the world to the ground to save me.

The Harry/Voldemort stories tend to fit that to a tee.
