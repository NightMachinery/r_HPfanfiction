I'm suddenly in the mood for any fics where harry just has enough and decides to bring lawyers and anything similar onto Umbridge, the ministry/minister, Rita, and/or the daily mail. If there isn't any, what are your takes on the idea of harry getting a lawyer?


** Harry with a lawyer is window dressing in approximately 2/3 of decently readable(IE: Weasley bashing is either limited in scope or simply increasing pre-existing flaws, the DEs are mostly either near pure evil/extreme racists/power hungry cowards/some combination of the three, Dumbledore is at least as competent as in canon, OCs are somewhat limited and written well, Harry's titles/full name don't take up an entire three sentence paragraph, and there's a struggle of some kind as opposed to pure wish fulfillment[not that Harry doesn't deserve riches, power, and a harem/loving relationship; but I'm of the opinion that there isn't much worth in something ‘important' if people aren't putting in much work, even in fiction]) Indy!Harry stories, usually as the well written OC or a canon character that doesn't have a stated profession. I can't really think of a specific example ATM, so I'd just browse Indy and filter out anything lacking significant grammar or whose summary otherwise starts ringing alarm bells.
