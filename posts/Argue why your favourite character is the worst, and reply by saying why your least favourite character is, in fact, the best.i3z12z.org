** I'm just gonna go and assume everyone's least favorite character is umbridge.... And I can't name a single thing that could make her the best. Well she as a character she is perfect she makes everyone hate her and that's basically her purpose really Jk Rowling did a great job making a character that HATEABLE.... Since I have never heard of someone who likes umbridge.. She makes our blood boil so she is perfect in that sense but as a person I want to kill her very slowly and chop her to tiny pieces wich I then feed to thestrals
