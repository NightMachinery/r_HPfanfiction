** Personally as a teacher, any teacher/student pairings throughly and completely squick me out, which vetoes Remus and Snape for Hermione. As for Sirius, I prefer time travel to make them of a more appropriate age range.

This might be unfounded, but I feel like the big age gap thing (like old enough to be your father/mother) would be more appealing to a younger audience that feels more mature than their peers (though not necessarily actually more mature). They get to self-insert and stuff.

As for Snape being more controversial, I would guess that it's because he's a controversial character, even unpaired.

Just my thoughts though.

***** Remus Lupin is my least favourite 'good' character. His complete lack of conviction in everything he does. His head in the sand approach to most things, really.

And then there's Tonks, who got her man by the /so/ romantic method of just wearing him down until he gave in.

It would have been an appalling marriage if they'd lived, and I end up angry on Ted's behalf that they both decided to go and fight, instead of thinking hey, perhaps one of us should make sure we're around for the kid.

The sheer lack of irresponsibility and forward thinking by both of them. I mean yes, it's common and normal and human, but.... these are not good people. They're screw-ups who happen to be on Dumbledore's team.

In the United States, age of consent laws regarding sexual activity are made at the state level. There are several federal statutes related to protecting minors from sexual predators, but laws regarding specific age requirements for sexual consent are left to individual states, territories, and the District of Columbia. Depending on the jurisdiction, legal age of consent ranges from 16 to 18 years old. In some places, civil and criminal laws within the same state conflict with each other.

It was a restriction on legal status. Dumbledore literally says that "Only students who are of age" can compete. By acknowledging that Harry has to compete the ministry declared him an adult.

********** No, it's not. A law is something that helps govern. This is a rule for a tournament. Harry wasn't declared an adult.

If you want to git finicky. Here's the actual quote:

#+begin_quote
  Eager though I know all of you will be to bring the Triwizard Cup to Hogwarts,” he said, “the heads of the participating schools, along with the Ministry of Magic, have agreed to impose an age restriction on contenders this year. Only students who are of age --- that is to say, seventeen years or older --- will be allowed to put forward their names for consideration.
#+end_quote

The age restriction is to put yourself forward for consideration, not to actually compete. Since someone else put Harry up for consideration, you can say it was legal, since the person who did was of age. Further,

#+begin_quote
  “Well . . . it is amazing,” said Bagman, rubbing his smooth chin and smiling down at Harry. “But, as you know, the age restriction was only imposed this year as an extra safety measure. And as his name's come out of the goblet . . . I mean, I don't think there can be any ducking out at this stage. . . . It's down in the rules, you're obliged . . . Harry will just have to do the best he ---
#+end_quote

Bagman uses the term "age restriction", and so does Dumbledore in the first quote. This suggests that the tournament was for 17 and up, rather than those "of age". What's the difference? They used physical age as a benchmark rather than the status of "of age". They merely used the "of age" as a benchmark for their youngest age.

Perfect analogy: The minimum age to compete in the NCAA is 18. If you're 17, you may compete with a waiver signed by you parents. Because you compete in the NCAA doesn't mean that you're emancipated. It means that you're allowed to participate.

Child abuse, torture of a minor and attempted manslaughter

Snape, on the other hand, hoped that by helping his master kill a father and his son he'd have a shot with the grieving widow. He is also guilty of child abuse through negligence, abuse of authority, misconduct as a teacher and most importantly, TREASON. While the three people you mentioned are far from saints they would face some quality prison time, but not execution. They were pieces of shit but they did not support an organisation which took their ideology and agenda straight from Mein Kampf (after changing the scapegoat).

I am pretty sure that being a Death Eater involved rape, murder and torture so we might as well count Snape guilty of those. The DEs were a group of racially motivated terrorists who killed for fun. Somehow I doubt that you can get into their inner circle (Snape was marked) without participating in that kind of free time activities.

If people are fine Harry hooking up with Bellatrix in time travels, then I don't see why Hermione can't get together with Snape in similar settings.

On the other hand, there are those AUs in which all the above characters behaved differently and made different choices. Starfox5 has written a really cool Mundungus, a real adventurer Lockhart, and maybe a Tomb Raider Petunia Evans. The Snape in "Stages of Hope" made friends with a different group of people and never joined Death Eaters. I mean fanfics are there for exploring alternate scenarios.

That said, time travel in specific gives interest to certain concepts regarding character life choices, like Snape not becoming a Death Eater. I think there's enough evidence in canon that he could have made a different choice, but that it would takes someone with fairly advanced foreknowledge of both future events and his character to convince him.

The biggest reasons I avoid reformation romance in time travel are wish-fulfillment writing and character whitewashing, not necessarily dislike for the concept.

While I agree absolutely that this is one of the pillars of fanfiction, there's also the fanfiction that fills in behind the scenes without changing characters. All those scenes that never made it to the books but must have happened, or fleshing out minor characters. That sort of thing.

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

*** This will not be popular opinion, but I think it depends what the reader is looking for. If you want some light fun romance, than Snape is not the best character to choose. If you want some dark, depressing story with disfunctial relationship, than why not.

It seems to me, that people tend to eww pairings/characters they don't like and they don't read these stories at all. Some people want to know at the beginning of the story what pairing it will have and depending on that they will (not) read the story. I think it is a mistake. Anything can be written well. If you will read only hpdg, you will miss a lot of awesome stories. IMO it is good to be open minded when you choose what fics to read - it will surprise you how something you thought would be terrible worked out very well.

But why would you inflict that on anyone? There are dysfunctional relationships (marriage law/contract with someone you do not love) and there's a relationship with a bigoted arsehole who hoped that he'd get some with a married woman after he helped to murder her husband and son. Even GRRM has the decency to give his characters a quick death (unless you are Reek).

***** I don't think most people read Snape quite that badly or think he was actually looking to get with Lily. He wanted her life to be spared- that's what he allowed the Dark Lord to think in order to get him to spare her. It'd be a bit tougher to explain that this "mudblood" was his friend since childhood and the only person who ever believed in him or gave him the time of day when he was young.

I also think Dumbledore was a bit of an asshole for pointing out that Snape wasn't begging him to save the lives of James and Harry. I think anyone in Snape's situation would assume that by informing Dumbledore that this family was in danger, Dumbledore would save the whole family, not leave two members to be killed unless Snape specifically begged for their lives as well. He focused on Lily because he cared about Lily- that's not the same thing as wishing the others were dead.

Look, I love Snape. He's a tortured, deep, character. He does good and bad things, and at the end of his life, he's a good man. But, at that point in his life, he's a selfish man, a bitter man, and a bad one. He didn't join the Death Eaters for shits and giggles.

My biggest reason I don't read those is often the relationship starts when Hermione is still in school, or only a year or two out of school. A story where Snape survived, and 10 years after graduation they meet again and start a relationship would have no ew factor for me. Then again, any relationship with Sirius or Remus would also have to have them survive longer because even for Sirius and Remus, Hermione would have to be at least 20 before the relationship starts for it to not thouroughly gross me out.

****** I read a story about a week ago with the Draco/Hermione pairing, just to see how it was portrayed. Long story short, Harry and Ron abandoned Hermione on the train to instead sit with Neville, while they told Draco to tell Hermione they were doing so. They [Draco and Hermione] both cried about the war (this was in their seventh year when everyone happened to return to Hogwarts to complete their education) and decided to go on a date with their first Hogsmeade visit. Afterwards, Hermione convinces Draco to abandon his blood prejudices in which he sent a letter to his parents saying that he likes Muggle-Borns, ala Hermione, and disassociated himself with his mum and dad due to their bigotry. Hermione then proceeds to tell Draco everything that happened when she, Harry, and Ron were on the run. Mind you, they are STILL ON THE TRAIN when all of this transpires and I hadn't even made it past Chapter 1.

I'm sorry, but as someone who was bullied so badly that I carried knives in my school shoes I am completely and totally with Snape on this one. He knew that Sirius had tried to set a werewolf on him, and it's not unreasonable for him to have suspected that Sirius might have tried to kill him again.

In the Roman Law there is what is called the 'reasonable man' test, which is basically where the judge must ask himself whether a reasonable man would have taken the relevant actions. It's often used where someone pleads self-defense in a murder trial. Most reasonable people would agree that, in a situation where one person is targeted by a group of four, at least one of whom wants him dead while the others don't particularly care if he lives or dies, a reasonable man would make sure to arm himself so as to be able to defend himself in future.

While I find it weird that you have a knife with you, but can't really judge, I can agree that you don't have other ways to defend yourself.

It's possible that AR had a lot to do with how negative people are about the ship, because of the age difference, just as Emma Watson is believed to be responsible for a lot of Hermione's popularity (never mind that she's the only fleshed-out young female character in a total sausage-fest) but to be honest I think many people just dislike the character and don't want to read about him being shipped.
