I need some good recommendations that were written this past year. Preferably during school/takes place at Hogwarts. Please and thank you!


** I just finished *Presque Toujours Pur* and I enjoyed it - linkffn(11153333)

A lot of people here seem to like *The Green Girl* - linkffn(11027125). Personally I didn't care for it. To me, Hermione was written as an OC that was given Hermione's name and I had a hard time getting over that. But like I said, many people like it and you might also.

  Bellatrix's torture of Hermione uncovers a long-kept secret. The young witch learns her true origins in a story that shows the beginning and end of the Wizarding wars as Hermione learns about her biological father and the blood magic he dabbled in that will control her future (Slight AU OotP---DH) Dramione - Pureblood!Hermione - Rated M for language, violence, and sexual scenes.
