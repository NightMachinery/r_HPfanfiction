Harry and a pureblood witch decide to screw over her family, be it for the sake of teenage rebellion, the family's support of Voldemort/Umbridge, being general dicks or because Harry and the witch are bored.

Their method of choice is to "find" a marriage contract with very favourable terms for Harry, rob her family blind through legal means and then split their "prize". Actual romance is optional, but at least a bromance between them would be appreciated.

  Harry's latent Occlumency shields manifests in an interesting way in the summer after his fifth year, and adventure bids him to head out and see the world. He will confront old friends, new insanities, the occasional Death Eater, far too many hedgehogs, and have way too much fun with it all. 'Tis the season, after all. HP/DG.

  A book left by Sirius opens Harry's eyes as he delves into the mysteries of magic, learns about the realities of a war, and shifts towards the Grey. Meanwhile, Daphne Greengrass is faced with an unusual solution that involves the Boy-Who-Lived, but could be more trouble than it's worth. And in the end, there is always a price to be paid for everything. HP/DG Contract, 6-7th year
