** Book!Hermione, no. But there are people who base themselves mainly on the movies, and are fans mostly of the movies. Per the movie's canon, /that/ universe's Hermione /is/, in fact, Emma Watson.

*** I hear what you're saying about choosing to base characters off the movie instead of the books, but I feel like anyone reading or writing fanfic has probably read at least the first book. They/we know book Hermione is buck toothed and frizzy haired. I think we'd see the same characterization even if the actress was not smoking hot.

*** Yes exactly Achile friend! :( I do TRY to at least keep their described physical features in the books how they are, but I can actually SEE the movies so I keep picturing them instead. But I do write how Hermione is buck toothed and not really attractive in my stories, and people don't react to her like she's a supermodel.

** Because most authors writing her that way are either girls projecting how they would want to look or guys projecting their wank fantasy/ideal girlfriend.

Hermione is such an awesome, vicious character and yet everyone either writes her as goody-two-shoes, arm candy or walking encyclopedia. I don't want Hermione as Data from Star Trek or Riley Reed from Pornhub, I want to read more of the Hermione who set Snape on fire, cursed the DA list and lead Umbridge into a Centaur gang rape. The one who chose Harry and the mission over everything else. The flawed girl who kicked arse nonetheless. She is not the most pleasant person to be around, nor the hottest one, but that's why I like her.

**** Nah, with the exception of Star Trek Enterprise, I never was a fan of the first officers.

If we are going Star Trek, Hermione is probably Seven of Nine (mainly because Janeway is too moral. Hermione would fit in as time travelling Janeway from the finale, however).

*** Personally I'm starting to think it's impossible to show Hermione's (or any others) true character in fanficton.

The reason is that authors are attached to the heroes and can't objectively look at them as whole persons.

Even here you see her as "an awesome, vicious character" and " flawed girl who kicked arse nonetheless" and totally ignore her being as just a teenage girl with hormones, insecurities and inabilities to build social relations.

** This seems a bit pointless. She portrayed her well enough in the series from an acting standpoint. And if we want to get technical, Hermione's reception to dressing up for the Yule Ball show she (in the books) could be as good looking as Wattson with some preparation time.

*** I think that the OP is referring to how in fanfiction, Hermione is portrayed as incredibly beautiful, while book Hermione is average at best. Emma Watson also didn't display the worst parts of Harry's character, and by worst, I mean the parts that Harry disliked the most.

The biggest weakness of movies, is that movies don't flesh out a character, and Hermione comes across as perfect, especially when she's far from it.

**** Do we really get much description of Hermione in the later books aside from the frizzy hair? Is she ever described as average?

I know we get a better description in the earlier books, but there are a lot of ugly ducklings at 11-14 years old who do not look like that as they come of age.

We know she fixed her teeth, one of her "glaring" physical traits that made her "average-looking". It's not like JK would ever go into the pervy detail that some people like to go into. "Over the summer, Hermione really started to fill out that top. And that ass became something you could bounce a quarter off." You think that's some detail JK would ever give? But I also don't ever remember her saying the contrary, so it's a valid interpretation by fanfiction writers that Hermione did in fact grow up to be a smokeshow.

******* I dunno if they ever really mention the part-veela stuff in the movie. And remember, there's really no story of Fleur and Bill getting together. It just randomly is thrown in at the start of 7 when they show up to rescue Harry and there's the first time we meet Bill. So a lot of her character development we see in HBP from the book is missing.

Just pointing out when he said how the actress who played Fleur is beautiful but didn't exactly exemplify a veela. With the movies, We miss out on a ton of Fleur's background, including most of her relationship with Bill and her part-veela nature.

** What a silly question. Whoever said Emma Watson was a 10/10 perfect Babe?

Not only do the massive majority of people on here have no idea what her personality in private is like (and how can you formulate a reasonable opinion of someone without that knowledge?) , but perceptions of beauty are subjective.

And, while I understand that there are many stories where Hermione's character is butchered into a goddess-like apparition, there are also many where it isn't. Where she comes as brave and loyal and studious, but also vicious, spiteful at times, and even prone to making mistakes. Read those!

This. She's pretty, but I probably wouldn't look twice if I saw her walking down the street. I like a fat bum and she's too boyish looking for my tastes.

This sub has a gigantic Hermione-boner, however. I've made threads where I wanted to discuss how differently Harry and Ron would've to be if she just didn't exist, and the top replies were basically scenarios of Harry and Ron's certain doom in year two with the basilisk, if not in year 1 already. Really blew my mind, cos all I wanted was ideas of how Harry and Ron (or just Harry) would've to step up and be better, and maybe the story could go in a different direction.

Right now, my favourite Hermione is in Lesser Evils/Ascended Vices. A much more nuanced character.

  ...because Hermione ‘turned white' --- that is, *lost color from her face after a shock* --- that she must be a white woman, which I have a great deal of difficulty with,” Rowling told The Observer. “But I decided not to get too agitated about it and simply state quite firmly that Hermione can be a black woman."
