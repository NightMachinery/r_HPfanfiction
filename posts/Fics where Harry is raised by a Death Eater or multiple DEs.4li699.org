Title states it all. Fics where Harry is raised by a DE or multiple DEs.


** Are you looking for any and all fics or decent-written ones? I can give you linkffn(5957714) basically involves Harry being raised by Bellatrix in a roundabout way. Technically he's in the care of Voldemort, but this works as well.

linkffn(2637012) is probably the one that fits your short (VERY SHORT) description of what you want, it's him being raised by the Malfoys.

linkffn(7767406) is once again him being raised by the Malfoys.

Note that from the three above, only one is anywhere near decent in prose. And even that is practically a copy of another story. Though it's rewritten now.

  A rewrite of the first part in my Dark Prince Trilogy. What if Wormtail hadn't told Lord Voldemort the Potters hideout. What if he took Harry straight to him instead? Book One of the Dark Prince Trilogy.
