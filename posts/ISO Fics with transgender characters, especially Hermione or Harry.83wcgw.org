Pretty much what the title says - I'm looking for fics where one of the main characters is trans. Character(s) or pairing doesn't matter, I'll sort out the ones I don't care for myself. I'm not really looking for genderswap stories, unless it's something like "In an attempt to shield their child from the prophecy, James and Lily Potter performed a forbidden ritual that changed their son to a daughter. However, the ritual was forbidden for a reason, and now Harriet Potter knows that his conviction that he should have been a boy wasn't wrong."

A good example would be Session Transcripts by lastcrazyhorn, but as that's literally the only story I currently know with a trans character I'll read pretty much whatever yall can give me! Thanks!

** These ones feature Trans Remus: linkao3(TransFigured [+podfic] by picascribit) and linkao3(All Hail the Outlaws by orphan_account), the second being a nonmagical AU. Both are really good. The first one is really heartfelt.

These two are short and sweet, featuring Trans Audrey (Percy's future wife): linkao3(Paperwork by Glass_CatOwl) and linkao3(At the Department of Magical Transportation by FireOpal (sandel).

"Son of Potter, Daughter of Black" falls in the /sex change to protect Harry/ category, "Jamie Evans..." and "Another day..." into the /unintened sex change/ and "The Chosen One has knockers" follows a similar premise but with more smut focus.

"Another day..." and "The Chosen one" both have an involuntary sex change but it comes down to "oh nice, I have tits now".

If you are looking for the "common" struggles trans people face then only "Son of Potter" applies since the others are more like "this isn't even in the top ten of odd shit that happened to me, the bloody Basilisk was worse".

I can also recommend several stories where Tonks can, voluntary or not, use her abilities to temporary change her sex, although again, none of them really depict it as a struggle but more like a natural strap-on that has its uses.

** I think my favorite fic as a transwoman myself would be linkffn(7452425) which always seemed to work wonderfully. There was another one I loved as well that just hit every point on the nose but I can't remember the name of it. Also, while most people enjoyed Magical Metamorphosis, I /really/ disliked it, and I think a lot of it comes from the fact that not only does the process seemed rushed, but the idea that Hermione, in like, what, 3rd year I think it was, instantly realizes that Harry is trans and like everything that goes with it. Always draws me out of it.

If you're looking for transgender fanfics in general, the Ranma 1/2 authors have a /bunch/ of wonderful ones as well.

I also have linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/285360?view_adult=true]]) although Teddy would be considered more genderqueer than trans. It was really well written though, one of the best stories I've read relating to this topic.

  “We thought you might be a werewolf," said Sirius."What?" Remus almost laughed at the absurdity."Last year. James and I thought --- but the dates didn't quite match up. With the full moons, I mean.""Well, I'm not.""I know. All I meant was, we thought you might be, and we still wanted to be friends. Whatever you're not telling us --- how much worse can it be?"

  When Sirius Black started University, he was hoping to be known as one of the guys. He hadn't expected to see a familiar face - someone who recognised him and could spill his secret... Transgender!Sirius. Muggle!AU. WolfStar.

***** TBH I think I dislike the pairing so much because it's usually written so absurdly, cringe-worthily cishet and I just 100% cannot wrap my head around anyone with metamorph abilities not being even a little bit fluid and/or queer.

****** I tend to imagine both Tonks and Teddy as some flavor of genderqueer and pansexual because of their metamorph abilities. It just makes the most sense to me.

******* Yup! And since I've headcannoned Remus as bi since I really first started thinking about it, I always saw that as being an important part of their relationship - Tonks gets to be as physically fluid as she wants to be and it legitimately doesn't phase Remus since he's neither gay nor straight.

******** I think of Remus as bi as well. I have this headcanon of Remus being in love with Sirius before Sirius went to Azkaban, then finds himself falling for Tonks, and then has to deal with his conflicting emotions when it comes out that Sirius is innocent. And then Sirius dies, and he's not sure how to process all his emotions, and Tonks (because she's super smart and guesses what's going on in his head) helps him process by letting him see Sirius again by physically changing into him for a night. I haven't seen a fic like this yet though.

I'm a lesbian, and I always have a good number of LGBTQ characters in my stories, because I think it's important and also /about time/ for people like me to get some clear and solid representation in entertainment media and stuff. :) So I'm going all THANOS and saying "Fine I'll do it myself." :) This story that I'm focusing on writing currently, Fight For Rights, has a bisexual adult female Harry, and one of the other main characters is a transgender vampire, and a gay man. :) There are also a lot of LGBTQ nonhumans and interspecies relationships. :) Gay mermen, lesbian centaurs, and a bi dragon. :)

**** Have you read my story yet? It's not over represented. It's just that my LGBTQ main characters likes to meet and spend time with others in her community. Just like in real life, going to gay bars or parades or other events. And even still, the majority of other characters in the story aren't LGBTQ.
