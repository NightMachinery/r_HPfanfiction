When I say wildly different I'm talking worlds where the Statue of Secrecy never existed in the first place, Dwarves are the go-to beings for banking and other financial services, Tolkienesque Elves exist and are occasionally seen walking around, things like that.


** Steelbadger has good LOTR crossovers where Harry ends up in Middle Earth. Quite heavy on the Tolkien lore.

  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

  A decade ago Harry Potter found himself in a beautiful and pristine land. After giving up hope of finding his friends he settled upon the wide plains below the mountains. Peaceful years pass before a Ranger brings an army to his door and he feels compelled once again to fight. Perhaps there is more to be found here than solitude alone. Harry/Éowyn.
