** SUMMARY: "I can get you Harry Potter," she whispered. "And the traitor Snape. In fact, I promise to hand them to you on a silver platter." She watched his ashen, pale face twist into a cruel, serpentine smile. With a flick of the Dark Lord's wand, her entire body ruptured with the agony of a thousand knives. That is how Hermione Granger celebrated her 18th Birthday. AU postOotP Spy!Hermione
