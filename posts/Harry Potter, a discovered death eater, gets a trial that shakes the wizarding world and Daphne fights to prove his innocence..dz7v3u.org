This is where Harry is discovered to be a death eater until his trial where it was proved that he was a spy put there by Dumbledore. Daphne tries hard to prove his innocence to the world and his family. Harry only joined Voldemort to protect his brother. He was trained hard by Moody. Potters are alive and Harry has two brothers, I think.


** So I can recall two fics with the premise of Harry becoming a death eater to protect his brother/family and the subsequent trial. The first is a [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5102870/1/][one-shot]] - linkffn(5102870) . However it does not mention Moody at all.

I think you're looking for [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9276562/1/][The Trial]] which is +unfortunately abandoned+ on hiatus. linkffn(9276562)

  A Harry Potter Oneshot. Follow Harry's journey through the shadows of the war with Lord Voldemort, and watch as he does everything necessary to ensure the survival of his family. Non-BWL Harry! BigBrotherHarry! Rated M to be safe.
