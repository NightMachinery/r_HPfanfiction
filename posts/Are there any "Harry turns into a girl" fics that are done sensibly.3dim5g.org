I feel like the idea of having a character turn into the opposite sex could make for some good writing, but every story I've read that employs this seems to use it as a quick way to make Harry/Draco possible without having to write slash.

There's no story that I've seen that touches on the fact that waking up into a body that's the opposite gender to the one you've lived in for all your life would be next to traumatizing. I'm trying to write a story which follows this idea, and I made it so that within minutes of Harry realizing he's a girl, he starts hyperventilating. Are there any stories that write about this subject in a way that makes sense?


** I've read some stories where Harry is born a girl, and those make sense. But I'm guessing that's not what you're getting at? IE, you're interested in stories where Harry starts out a boy and transforms, rather than AU stories where she was always a girl.

** I hesitate to rec this as I don't really feel it's the author's best work, but linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10969324/1/This-Isn-t-Even-My-Final-Form]]) has a Harry being rather blasé about turning female(like Jamie Evans), although in this case he's 12, has yet to discover the joys of puberty and rather more excited about having wings. Chemical imbalances don't occur until s/he's 15 and realises that protoplasmic humans can be attractive. The story will probably shape up to be a Twelfth Night-esque comedy of errors, it's only 3 chapters at the moment.

Heh, Twelfth Night, now I want a fic where a young Bellatrix crossdresses to escape the clutches of +Marvolo+Malvolio.

**** Well, mostly that it's used as a convenience, just to get Draco with Harry or something, as you said. It's a mechanism for writers to make things easier for them as writers, without offering some sort of exploration of what the implications would be or what it means for the characters. Maybe it's because I've lived a lot of those implications (or something similar), but they're always in my mind when I try and read fem!Harry.

If my body magically changed into a woman's, the freak-out I'd have is mostly due to an unexpected major alteration of my body. I am informed that I am unusual in this; I've heard teachers talking to students about what they'd do if their bodies switched sexes, and the boys tended to say they that they would commit suicide.

Anyway, I'd take a quick trip to Mdm Pomfrey's to check on my overall health, check on the options for changing back, and not worry unless Mdm Pomfrey says I should.
