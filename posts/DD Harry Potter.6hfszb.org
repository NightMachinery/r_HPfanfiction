Hi all,

I hope a few of you can help me with story ideas for a Roleplaying Harry Potter game I am homebrewing soon.

All I have so far is that I want them to be Hit Wizards working with the Aurors to do... something.

It will be a one shot story with at least 3 players taking about 2 hours ideally.

Any ideas on where to take the story would be great.

Thanks


** Do you know what kind of mood/tone you want the story to have? Dark and mysterious, horror, funny, etc.

*** Thanks for the reply. I'm open to anything really, 2 of my players will be playing for the first time so I'm keeping things loose and knowing the crowd it might devolve into jokes whatever I do.

I think a bit of a bleak tone works well in the universe but I don't want it depressing.

** How about making them Hitwizards for the IWC, there is a Dark Wizard (Not yet a Lord which I would call his boss and the BBEG of a campaign) that has been spotted in the area of the One Shot. They land in the country's Ministry building and meet with a local Auror who gives them the lay of the land and 3 places to get info from, 1 the Light Sides Tavern where they can get info freely but it may not be right, the Neutrals Inn which means they may have to buy the info but have little left for good (Like a Portkey to the site of the Villain, Healing Potions, Buff Potions) and finally the Dark Bar where they have to use some good roles on checks or may have to fight for the Info and it will be good, but the Villain may get tip from a little birdy.

They eventually get to the hideout to only learn the Dark Wizard is gathering Lackey's , they bowl through them feeling like badasses, get to the Dark Wizard who is mildly tough (like a couple levels above, not a impossible task). They get him on his knees and he does something like "Oh you think you can stop the Ascension of Dark Lord Ixarbear!? Feel the power of my Demonic Summoning!" He cast a spell behind him, a tear opens and something pops through like a Beholder or maybe he has a Manticore. The monster kills The Dillweed and you have the Players fight the Manticore.
