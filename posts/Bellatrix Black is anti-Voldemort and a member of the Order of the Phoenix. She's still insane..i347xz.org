** EDIT: Holy crap, guys! I went to sleep and this blew up! I have medical appointments to prep for and go to right now, but I promise that I will reply to everyone when I have time later. Also awards! Thank you!

It was supposed to be a simple assignment. Go in, torture the Longbottoms, find out where the Dark Lord was, exit, find Dark Lord - profit. It wasn't. It really wasn't. It was such stuff as Death Eaters' nightmares are made of.

The Lestrange brothers and Crouch made their way up to the nursery, their footsteps cushioned as they followed a high voice crooning.

"Hush little baby, don't say a word. Mama's gonna buy you a mocking bird..." Crouch pushed the door open and revealed a woman sat at the window, singing a lullaby to the moon with her back to the door. "If that mocking bird don't sing..."

She turned around to reveal a beautiful woman. Her heavy-lidded eyes sparkled with feral delight as the moon illuminated her dark hair like a demonic halo. She seemed... Familiar. Somehow.

"/Bellatrix!/" Rodolphus snarled beside Crouch. "Stay out if this, blood traitor!" Suddenly he knew exactly who she was: Bedlam Bella. Most feared Auror of all time and infamous blood traitor. You could reason with Mad-Eye Moody, or blow a bit of him off and run. Not her. With her, you either took Azkaban or went down like a dog on the highway. No mercy.

"Fifteen." Bellatrix Black stood up and cocked her hip to one side.

"Fifteen what, you mad bitch?!"

Her smile stretched out like shark teeth under her blood red lips.

"Why," she laughed. "Fifteen minutes until Moody's here to save you!"

The next seven minutes were the most brutal that Barty Crouch Jr would ever experience. Rodolphus died first. He took a bone crushing curse to the pelvis after telling her exactly what he would do to his ex-fiancée if he ever got his hands on her. Barty slipped in his blood as his brother was flayed alive by a hundred steel-winged butterflies.

Barty was a whimpering mess by the time Bella loomed over him on the floor.

"Tell me, child: Who betrayed the Potters?"

"Peter Pettigrew!" He practically yelled. "I was there when he got his Mark! He wasn't allowed one until he could hand over the Potters or someone who could tell us!"

"Good boy." She purred as she patted him derisively on the cheek. She stepped back and looked him up and down assessingly. "Barty, dear heart, I am a very busy woman. I've just saved one neffy-poo, now I need to go and rescue another neffy-poo from some atrocious muggles... Oh, and I need to go and save my cousin from the fact he is a massive drama queen! It's all terribly exhausting!"

Barty nodded vigorously.

"So, cher Barty, I need you to sit exactly where you are until Mad-Eye Moody comes and gets you, hm? Stay right here and tell him what you told me. You can do that, can't you?"

Barty nodded again.

"Good... Because if you didn't, I'd have to accidentally scratch you with a very nasty cursed hairpin I own, and you'd have to see every single potential death you could ever have experienced. Nobody wants that Barty, do they?"

When Alastor Moody arrived, he found carnage. Blood, debris and horrors that mocked the very notion of a corpse. In the middle of it all, sat in a puddle of piss and blood was a very scared man that babbled that he needed to speak to him. /Now./

I enjoyed this wuite a lot. If you decide to preserve it for posterity somewhere, I want to mention that I found it a bit ambiguous when you wrote, " Barty slipped in his blood as his brother was flayed alive...," as if Barty had a brother. I knew what you meant / figured it out after a moment, but maybe you want to make it clearer.

******* Rodolphus', as Rabastan has not been mentioned at that point, even by pronoun. It says "Rodolphus died first." Presumably all the "he" pronouns in the next sentence refer to Rodolphus. Then in the following sentence it says "Barty slipped in his blood..." This itself could be ambiguous because it could mean Barty slipped in his /own/ blood, but that is negated by the mention in the second part of that sentence by 'his brother," as Barty presumably does not have a brother present. So "his blood" is Rodolphus' blood.

Oddly, this conversation is sort of similar to another one I had recently on a different platform, but we were deconstructing an art piece instead of a paragraph. It was fan art of Hermione and Draco kissing, and we were trying to figure out if Draco had his hand on Hermione's left or right leg. Took a lot of analysis of her center of gravity in the pic.

#+begin_quote
  Thirteen-year-old Bella Black intended to go back in time to start a war in service to her patron goddess. Ritual magic goes awry and she finds herself in 1993, faced with a failing House of Black, an insane alter ego, and a Dark Lord on the rise. Chaos ensues. Title drop. (A collaboration by LeighaGreene and inwardtransience)
