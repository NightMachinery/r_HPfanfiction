Ages ago I read a fic that was HarryxFleurxGabrielle. I remember it was quite fluffy and very long (100k+) I seem to remember them having their own room in Hogwarts. Even if it's not the fic I'm looking for any similarly fluffy stories with this pairing would be appreciated!

  Harry helps Fleur in the second task of GOF and pays the price. HP/Fleur/Gabrielle/Hermione. A Veela bonding fic based on love. T Rated and it will stay that way. Thirteen year old Almost fourteen Gabrielle to start the story. Good Dumbledore.
