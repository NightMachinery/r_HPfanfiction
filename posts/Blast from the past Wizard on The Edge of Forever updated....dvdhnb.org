Boy I was puzzled when this updated popped up in my inbox and I had no clue what this story was anymore: Linkffn(4944819) "Wizard on the Edge of Forever" by rpnielsen - a HP/Star Trek crossover.

This story was started in 2009, and just now updated again ten years later! Hope they keep it up.

Curious about your favourite story that has taken a similar long time to be written. Completed stories preferred.
