So, what are some of your favorite magical spells, artifacts, or potions from fanfics?

Have you come across any interesting genetic magical abilities? (Why are metamorphmagi the only type?)

Or how about fanfic takes on canon magic?

For example, I like it when the Deathly Hallows are a bit more.. special than they really seemed to be in canon. Particularly the Invisibility Cloak. I feel as though it should function when worn as a cloak, not draped over yourself like a blanket. More importantly, it supposedly hides one from Death. In my mind Moody's eye shouldn't be able to detect someone wearing it, and a /cat/ certainly shouldn't either.

So yeah, is there any fanon magic that stands out to you?

*** Agreed, the use of divination in that fic is very good. I love how seemingly one of the most useless subjects actually turns out to be really useful and powerful. I especially like imagining the reactions of all the characters who think it is total bullshit (namely McGonagall and Snape) when they actually see it successfully used to get accurate information and do things.

** From Prince of the Dark Kingdom - the existence of a potion that was the opposite of felix felicis. Instead of making you extremely lucky, this potion is like a poison that plagues you with bad luck. How things just slowly go wrong. Starting from the smallest things like tripping down the stairs, forgetting about an important test, losing glasses and ending in events just that could result in getting the target killed.

I like the idea that the liquid luck potion has an opposite. It is quite brutal, but also kind of entertaining to read about.

(I don't think the cloak conceiled the sounds they made while wearing it, so it didn't stop Mrs Norris from smelling Harry either. Also, the Tale of the Three Brothers is a fairy tale, so it might have been a bit exaggarated.)

When I first read how Professor Vector was working with it I was just amazed!

I'm not very talented with maths to be honest, but imagining making up advanced and complicated arithmetic equations which represent people or situations is so interesting! And then for that to become visual in the form of a glowing grid like matrix where all the equations are working together and impacting each other.

So cool!

When the trailer for Fantastic Beasts came out I saw a glowing grid thing and I got so bloody excited.

Maybe this is canon, but I don't think I ever read it quite like I did in the fanfic.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/895946/Lightning-on-the-Wave][The Sacrifices Arc by Lightning on the Wave]] has some pretty interesting magical concepts. Some specific concepts:

- a King Fisher curse that plagues the victim repeatedly without abating
- specific concepts regarding magical core binding (I don't want to reveal too much as it's a plot point)
- Pureblood rituals ingrained into daily life: alliances, truce rituals, and courting rituals
- Specific aspects of Light and Dark magic that are only accessible by people Declared to each (again, major plot point, but a Declared Dark wizard has specific tools available that an undeclared or Light wizard would not)
- New magical systems introduced from outside communities while remaining native to the geographical lore
- Magic relating to family Houses (ie Malfoy Manor and the Potter's ancestral home) and specific geographical markers

This series also delves deeply into mind magic and Legilimency/Occlumency and provides some unique and wonderful visualizations of the magic.

As discussed in other threads, it has aged into a series filled with cliches, but the series ran from 2005-2007. Take it with a grain of salt and I think you will find some wonderful moments.

** If utterly non-canon things are allowed, I must say I like all the Transfiguration worldbuilding in HPMOR. /Unlike certain screenwriters we could name/, I'm not under the misapprehension that it's at all canon, but nonpermanent Transfiguration is a cool idea that lends itself well to the observed uses of Transfiguration in canon, with a few clever tweaks, and it leads to a great reveal in how the Philosopher's Stone works. Also from HPMOR and sequels, the whole Interdict of Merlin idea. Again, "ancient magic was more powerful" is not a trope I think is /canon/, but HPMOR does it (and explains it) brilliantly and it all ties together with the Chamber of Secrets and Flamel and Hogwarts itself.

On a wholly unrelated note, Arithmancy as spellcrafting. Divination in general is somewhat lame, and acknowledged as such by wizardkind, so having not one, not two, but /three/ different Divination electives seems ludicrous even by Hogwarts standards --- whereas a spellcrafting class fills a hole. And having it be a pseudoscientific process with cold hard rules makes it all the clearer why only geniuses (or at least very bright people) are seen crafting spells. I just like it. So I've transplanted how Arithmancy works in, say, /The Arithmancer/ into my headcanon by calling it "Charms Theory".

One thing I am neutral about is wards and runes. They can be done right, and don't rub me the wrong way in the same way that magical cores or elemental magic do, it's just... I like /canon/, nonmagical Runes, as just this fancy, purposefully-hard-to-decipher cipher alphabet made by wizards as a test of will for anyone trying to learn from an old grimoire --- it's just a cool idea, and creates far less plotholes with canon events. And if permanent wards as their own branch of magic /were/ a thing, there are too many things you would expect to see that you don't: targeting wardstones when attacking an enemy base, a Ward class at Hogwarts, etc.

Okay but Latin.

A whole hell of a lot of the spells that they use are Latin or derived from Latin. So by learning Latin as a language you would also be learning spells - although not the wand movement that went along with them. Not to mention a wizard conversing in Latin would have to be awfully careful.

Nor were they invented by wizards. Runes are also, as far as we know, /younger/ than Latin and were initially the province of nations which hadn't been Romanised, so mostly Germania and Scandinavia. However, once they were in use they were used in various formats into the sixteenth century. But we do have historical evidence of runes being used to do magic, or being used to do what the carvers /believed/ was magic - there's a Swedish runestone which says roughly "I conceal runes of power and anyone who breaks this stone will die".

So there's certainly historical precedent for having a stone carved with runes being magical or powerful.

As such, it is possible that “/the/ futhark” does not mean any specific one, or even that Madame Rowling just used the word “futhark” to mean “these be runes” without regard to what is actually called with this name and that thus it means some wizarding-only runic system.

******* Elder and younger futhark aren't separate runic systems, they're the same one at two different points in history, with a few runes dropped as the language changed. Move the elder futhark across the sea and have it adopted by a slightly different culture and it becomes Anglo-Saxon futhorc, which needed extra letters, probably to cover all the word-borrowing the angles and saxons were doing from the brythonic and cumbric speakers they were settling among. Runes after that are either mediaeval or modern runes and thus outwith the scope of the Hogwarts course.

My headcanon? The rune-stones that claimed they were magical writing are, in-universe, right and it's possible to work magic by writing it down with sufficient informational density, which means that you have to do it in a script in which the letters have both sound-value and individual meaning, as runes do.

This also accounts for the ancient egyptian practise of writing protective spells for their dead on the inside of tombs in hieroglyphs, spells that have to be broken by the likes of Bill Weasley. Each hieroglyph has a rebus-like sound value /and/ a determinative meaning.

Doing magic in forms of writing where the letters have only sound-value requires additional ritual, hence the curse-scrolls and written amulets that archaeologists keep digging up. And the now-extinct folkway of burying your enemy's name, written on a stone, to sympathetically bring about his actual funeral.
