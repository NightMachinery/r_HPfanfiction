** First, I will redirect you [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/8s7q2y/is_harry_potter_a_good_friend_to_ron_and_hermione/][here]] to a thread in the same vein where I answered my thoughts on the three.

Secondly, its worth considering a few things.

- How many twelve year olds would help you sneak past a giant three-headed dog?
- How many thirteen year olds would spend months of their free time in a bathroom brewing an illegal and very difficult potion? How many would be willing to take said potion?
- How many thirteen year olds would follow their greatest phobia deeper into "The Forbidden Forest" in the middle of the night to get answers when they are theoretically in no danger themselves?
- How many fourteen year olds would get up and stand in front of a mass murderer (in there mind) to protect their friend? How many would attack their teachers (on second thought a lot of them would probably attack Snape, but still).
- How many fourteen year olds would break a hundred laws and school rules to help you travel back in time and literally jailbreak a pair from death row from there own government under the head of state's nose?

And thats just in the first three books.

**** Regarding Ron, breaks off his friendship? They stopped talking for three weeks. On the scale of teenage drama, and what fourteen year old boys /actually/ do when they fight, this is 2 out of 10. Compared to the opposite ends of that, where Ron stood up for Harry the year after and during CoS when people thought he may have been crazy or even a murderer, its just mildly annoying.

Regarding Hermione, I don't know exactly what you mean by "ices." If you are referring to her disdain for Snape's notes, while she may have not liked him using them, she never /did/ anything. She never told a teacher. And, remember this, *she was right*. Harry was being a moron for attempting spells with no idea what the outcome would be. Sectumsempra was just the worst of the worst. Harry was playing with fire. Admittedly Hermione was a bit jealous, but she never said anything to the teachers either: because she valued her friendship more.

Here's the deal. The conflicts Harry has with Ron and Hermione in the books are a narrative device. By the third book, its pretty obvious not much actually happens till April/May/June in the rest of the book aside from some minor mystery and faffing about. Thus, Rowling has to add conflicts like these to break up the monotony.

To put it bluntly, Rowling seemed to have learned this from Chamber of Secrets. Remember that? Where almost nothing happens from January to April?

***** Harry was a moron for attempting a spell specifically labeled "for enemies" without knowing what it did. And that against someone who was using Unforgivable Curses and in a fair world should have been fair game.

Hermione showed loyalty in that she didn't tell a teacher about the book, but she also showed her stubbornness and inflexibility by refusing to acknowledge the usefulness of the /Muffliato/ spell or ever ask /why/ the Prince's recipe's worked better than the printed ones. In other words, she didn't do anything to try to work /with/ Harry for most of that year, like she probably should have.

****** Thats more or less what I meant.

Though honestly, I /suspect/ Hermione didn't tell Slughorn (or whoever) because unlike in 3rd year she didn't really have a legitimate argument other than 'Harry is reading someones notes and doing better.' It may or may not have been cheating, it was definitely unfair, but thats not enough for her to rationalize ratting him out.

*****  Don't get me wrong Ron and Hermione are great friends and I have the same opinion but you are whitewashing Hermione a lot in the sixth year. She didn't even entertain the possibility of Draco being a Death Eather, she "told him so" when Dumbledore died, she was right about the book but the reasons were worng and if she even suspected the book being cursed she would have acted immediately. You also give a lot of points about of not telling teachers after a fake Moody, Umbridge´s Inquisition and Mcgonagal incompetence.

But yes, Hermione is a great friend but she also can be stuborn and a bitch.

I agree that their little break up in the fourth book wasn't nearly as bad as a lot of people claim but.. 2/10? What kind of drama were the people you knew getting up to? I've literally never had a fight even half as severe as that with any of my close friends.

******** Right.

Arguments in Hogwarts, particularly within a house or year, remind me more of the sort that happen between close family members. They live together and come into contact, so friendships and conflict are far closer than normal. Know this from slightly similar experience.

Additionally, given the proximity, the other houses are like 1st or 2nd cousins. You like some, you don't like others, but you only see them on a few occasions or at larger family gatherings (read: meals in the Great Hall).

****** If they were just "not talking" because Harry broke Ron's favourite CD or stuff like that, it'd just be a normal fight. But Ron accusing Harry of entering himself and then being a shitty friend by not telling him how goes against everything Harry stands for. It's like he doesn't even know his "best" friend.

******* He was 14, emotional and not a very perceptive person in general. Harry's entrance into the tournament also brought up some very raw and ugly parts of himself that he couldn't bear to look at, let alone try to understand - jealousy, insecurity, greed, resentment. Was it shitty and immature thing to do? Hell yes. But I think he just let his temper and insecurities blind him, and was too immature to recognise that.

******** And while these are valid explanations, it wouldn't stop stop Harry from being affected by it. The knowledge that his friend is capable of turning against him would sour their friendship permanently. I've had my share of experiences with untrustworthy friends, people of whom I have expected better. Returning to the status quo is impossible because you remember that they already turned against you once and you are left wondering when and not if they'll do it again.

What makes me disagree with this is not the fight, but the context of the fight. Harry life was in danger, and it was the attention that made Ron distance himself. This is definite, Hermione made this clear earlier, so Ron already knew the tournament was possibly lethal and definitely dangerous, unlike what some people sometimes try to defend him on.

It reminds me of an incident in high school where a gay guy friend of mine - who was a bit of an attention whore if I'm being honest - had unprotected sex and a couple weeks later had a rash that was freaking him out. Turned out to be nothing serious but initially he got a lot of pity from our friends. Now at the time I was a fundamentalist Christian, and if I had dropped him as a friend for a few weeks doing that and for, I dunno, trying to "get attention" because of it, that would make me a pretty big asshole.

In Ron's case it didn't even make sense to do to Harry since he was never an attention seeker. So that makes the fighr much worse to me, because it takes a life threatening situation and treats it as the victim's fault. It really annoyed me, ran contrary to Ron's actions in CoS.

** I don't know what more you have to do than join up with someone trying to defeat a Dark Lord knowing full well that if you don't succeed you'll die horribly to be considered a good friend.

But I suppose facing a troll together at the age of eleven, saving each other's arses any number of times, and sticking together even when the entire castle hates Harry's guts all enjoy consolation prizes.

**** You have to be delusional to read the books and not think Ron and Hermione were extremely good friends.

Yes, the trio get jealous, angry and petty with each other. Yes, they annoy each other and hide things from one another and have disagreements. But when it comes down to it, they've always, /always/, got each other's backs. Ron deserts Harry and Hermione during the hunt but cools down and realises his mistake and tries to find a way back. Hermione accuses Harry of having a hero complex when he wants to "save" Sirius but she still accompanies him to the Ministry anyway, almost dying in the process. She risks her life for her friend despite her misgivings about the whole mission.

That's what friendship is all about. You can have your disagreements but in the end, you'll do anything for each other. Friendship is not about always agreeing with and never questioning your ultra-powerful 13 year old Lord Husband in his quest to destroy his enemies - génocidaires and social reformers alike. Daphne writers and fans (like you seem to be) would do well to realise this.

** Ron and Hermione are both MUCH better friends to Harry than Harry is to them. Over the course of seven books, they generally go out of their way to be supportive and helpful to him, even when it's inconvenient or even detrimental to themselves. It's actually pretty rare for Harry to return the favour; in fact as the books go on he sometimes seems to take Ron and Hermione for granted, and he never really takes the time to try and understand them or see things from their point of view. He pretty much has to make everything about him, and if it isn't about him, or at least affects him in some way, he generally isn't that interested in it.

Part of this is understandable... Harry plain NEEDS more support than Ron and Hermione do because he goes through bigger trials and has more on his plate. But I think that because he's the POV character, that people experience the story through and put themselves in the place of, often fans just ignore the fact that Harry was far from the perfect friend himself. He generally demands more than he's willing to give back.

This doesn't mean Harry is a bad person, or that he's a terrible friend in general. Overall he's a kind and generous person, happy to share what he has with his friends, and always willing to step in if they're in trouble. But he's also often insensitive, self-absorbed and not very good at realizing when he's being a total jerk.
