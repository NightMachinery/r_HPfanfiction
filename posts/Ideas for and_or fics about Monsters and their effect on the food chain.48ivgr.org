So there is a huge set of magical flora & fauna in the HP 'verse as well as a disproportionately large number of magical creatures that we know can and do eat human beings on a regular basis. So between Nundus, Vampires, Quintapeds, Trolls, Giants, Werewolves, Boggarts, Dementors, Dragons, Acromantulae, Hags and Dark Wizards/Witches, who is actually sitting on top of the food chain? Also, what effect do these magical beasts have, either directly or indirectly, on the ecosystem of HP 'verse Earth? Because a Great Cat the size of a house that acts as a mobile Biohazard breeding lab, melting pot and pressure cooker wandering around Africa and Asia? That's one hell of an environmental impact right there. Has anyone actually tackled this before in a fic or otherwise?


** If their prey (humans) can regularly kill them, using tools or not, they're not on top of the food chain. As for nundu and the like, they have to have some sort of use or exterminating them would be necessary to keep the statute safe. There's a warhammer 40k/HP crossover by littlewhitecat I believe that discusses the response to these animals but not the reasons why.

*** Yeah, Inquisitor Carrow and the Bureaucracy of Failure. One of my all-time favorites that features an OC that is an actual Character (Timothy Faulks aka everyone's favourite commissar/sunbro in the wizarding world)-I cannot recommend this fic enough to anyone reading this that hasn't read that series of fics-if only to witness the awesome that is the God Emperor geeking out.

Apart from that, the food chain in the Wizarding World seems to be a lot more complicated, not to mention primordial, than ours. Ultra-large predators such as Dragons, Giants etcetera still roam the wilds and take a particularly large amount of effort to subdue/kill-which implies a food source large enough to sustain a stable population. Dementors and other creatures do not need to kill their victims to feed on them, but rather reduce them to a state of catatonia (that's how I picture a Kiss victim at least. I don't buy them stealing their souls so much as basically munching on their psyche, leaving just enough lower brain functions behind to keep the body alive) and are ridiculously hard to kill and/or injure. And then you have the artificially created lifeforms such as Basilisks to contend with, beasts that have terrible power yet could have potentially been created to fill ecological niches perceived to be unoccupied by their creators-or replace the current occupants of said niche with beings that can be controlled by said creators with minimal effort.

There's a whole esoteric ecosystem there that remains vastly underexplored.

As for not exterminating them, the answer is actually fairly simple-the flora and fauna in question generate resources with specific magical properties that boost the effectiveness or enable the creation of potions & artifacts that would otherwise not exist. Killing off the population of a particular species would be extremely expensive in terms of having to replace or replicate the various magical feats the species in question allows wizards and witches to achieve-and that is not even considering the number of races whose intelligence level is at the very least equivalent to a human's. Or the impact on the local esoteric ecosystem. Far better to corral and contain until a permanent solution to whatever problem these things exhibit can be found.

Oh, and then there's the fact that a fair amount of magical infrastructure (security systems, post, prison guards, banking & finance etcetera) relies on the involvement of magical creatures to function. Without them, an awfully large chunk of the magical world would simply cease to exist in any particularly meaningful way.
