I am looking for a Harry Potter story where Harry is similar to the main protagonist of unnatural history or like Lara Croft or Indiana Jones just a harry who fits that mold.


** In addition to linkffn(Bungle In The Jungle) which is linked below, *Harry Potter and the Sun Queen* linkffn(10659456) literally places him into a Tomb Raider game, *A Long Journey Home* linkffn(9860311) has aspects of this, especially in the newer chapters, *The Black Prince* linkffn(11098283) is Harry in the Game of Thrones universe with that level of adventuring.

You also have *Illusions of Grandeur* linkffn(8957424) where Harry is...something that goes on adventures (against his will at times) with the Winchesters in the Supernatural universe. I'm not doing a good job selling it, but Harry basically is feared by the Angels in that Universe and is a powerful being unto himself. It's quite good.

*Altered Destinies* linkffn(3155057) isn't quite up that alley, but it does feature heavy on Harry and the cohorts of the time fighting WWII in both the wizarding and muggle world. It is also quite good.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

  DONE! Harry has defeated Voldemort, but it was a costly victory. Aberforth Dumbledore presents a plan to go back and kill the infant Riddle, but Harry will have to stay there 10 years. Can Harry alter the wizarding world's destiny? WWII and Grindelwald

  Angels, demons, and Winchesters have made it to the top of Harry's black list, but first impressions are rarely right, and a glass of scotch can soothe anyone's temper. Starts mid season 3 and spans several seasons. Rated T for coarse language and mild violence. Now completed.

#+begin_quote
  He remembers being Harry Potter. He dreams of it. He dreams of the Great Other too, a beast borne of ice and death with eyes red as blood and an army of cold dead things. He is the second son of the king, a spare, but his fortunes change when secrets rather left in the dark come to light, and Westeros is torn asunder by treachery and ambition. Winter is coming, but magic is might.

  During his exploration of the history of the magical Far East, Harry Potter finds cryptic references to an island Kingdom called Yamatai, supposedly ruled by the powerful Sun Queen Himiko until its sudden disappearance millennia ago. He never was able to pass up a good mystery.

**** Black Prince is all right. Heavy on the slow-boil but I feel it'll have a great pay off at the end. It's what made me start writing my own HP-GoT crossover. That, and *The Wizard of Harrenhal*.

  The Master of Death, Harry Potter, wakes one cold spring morning in Westeros. He has no idea why he's there - or how he'll get back. Harry always had bad luck, but a lot of persistence. He'll need it. Winter is Coming.
