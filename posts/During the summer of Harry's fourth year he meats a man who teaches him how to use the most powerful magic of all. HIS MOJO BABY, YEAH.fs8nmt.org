** It was late in the afternoon when Harry dragged himself back from the playground.

For some strange reason, a tumbleweed blew past.

Harry was walking down the footpath of Wisteria Avenue, and saw something that definitely didn't belong. Not in the fun, bright purple way the Knight bus didn't belong, but an old Jaguar convertible, painted with in the Union Jack. It looked very retro. The driver, who was sitting on the bonnet without a care, was a curly haired man in an open-necked ruffly white shirt and tight pants, wearing platform soles. He looked up as Harry approached "Hello, Where am I" said the man, smiling and showing off terrible teeth.

"Little Whinging , Surrey" said Harry, noticing, with horror that the man seemed to have a carpet shoved down his shirt, and a great big golden medallion, in .. was that a jewelled Male symbol? This guy must be a total Prat.

"Powers, Austin Powers" said Austin, hopping down of the bonnet. "I'm just waiting for my mechanic. Who are you?"

"Harry Potter" said Harry, with a sigh.

"Well Harry, you can't go though life moping like that. You're a MAAN. You owe it to the chicks to be a Strutting, Loving Maan" said Austin. Harry couldn't begin to think of all the ways he didn't feel like a Strutting, Loving Man.

This idiot remined Harry, vaguely of Sirius; when he was talking about being God's gift to women somehow crossed with Lockheart.

"How can you be waiting for your mechanic of you don't know where you are" asked Harry.

"Tracker in the car, part of the videophone" said Austin, winking.

Harry laughed "Yeah, right, CArs don't have videophones"

"Well Ordinary cars don't, but I'm an international Man of Mystery" said Austin. "Her Majesty's greatest weapon. Not just in bed either."

Harry choked. This guy was taking himself seriously.

"Look, one of my friends was murdered by a psychopath in front of me, I was tortured and barely escaped. If you'll excuse me I'm going to go home, get yelled at, and hate myself" said Harry.

"Did he gloat" asked Austin completely seriously.

"Before he tortured me, yeah" said Harry.

"Where do you live, Harry Potter?" asked Austin, suddenly all business.

"Oh no, I'm not telling strange, flamboyant mane where I live" said Harry.

"Don't Worry Harry, I'm strictly HET-rosexual, at least twice a day" said Austin, with an awful-toothed grin. "Here's my ID" said Austin, and handed over a black folding wallet that he somehow got out of his tight pants.

Harry opened the wallet. A golden ID read "Austin Powers, MI6. International Man of Mystery"

Smaller print indicated that police could call a government number for confirmation, that Austin was allowed to speed, carry guns and generally raise hell.

"You're not exactly a Secret agent, are you?"

"No way, I'm a in-your-face agent." said Austin proudly. "I get results...speaking of which...."

From towards Harry's house came a young woman with short pink hair in ripped jeans, combat boots and a leather jacket over a band t-shirt. Harry was intrigued, till he saw the band name... Weird Sisters. This was a witch.

"Harry, you have to come with me" she said "Step away from this ...gentleman"

"Baby, don't brush me off, we haven't even met" said Austin Powers, and winked at the witch.

She looked irritated, then... suddenly less irritated. "Who are you"

"I'm Austin Powers. Powers by Name, Powers by Nature" he said, with a grin.

The withc grinned back "Tonks." she said, "Harry, you need to get home" she said.

"Well, Tonks, Baby, How about Harry goes home and You and I got out for dinner."

"I, er.. I'm part of Harry's securit detail" said Tonks.

"Call my number when you finish your shift, and I'll get you off" said Austin, handing Tonks a gold-edged card.

"Oh, and Harry's address?" said Austin,handing Tonks his ID.

Tonks looked at his ID and snorted. "Not exactly subtle are you" she said, handing it back.

"Subtle is for after dinner" said Austin, with a wink.

"4 privet drive" said Harry. This guy was weird, but he seemed strangely legitimate.

Austin pulled a pen and pad out of his car's glove-box and wrote it down.

"Harry was saying he was monologued, tortured and one of his friends was murdered in front of him" said Austin, "I'll be around to help him out. Clearly he's only getting started, but With my help, he can be real International Man of Mystery."

Harry stared at the berk. The berk who was going to help him. What?

"Why help me?" Harry asked.

"Everyone gets captured by their arch-nemesis and tortured. Having a friend murdered as well, that's pretty tough for a kid. I was twenty before my first friend was murdered in front of me" said Austin, with a brief sniff.

"You know.. You know what this is like" said Harry, a tiny seed of hope in his chest.

"Oh course" said Austin, "So Tonks? eight o clock at the savoy? Wear a ballgown"

Tonks stared at Austin "Not bloody likely" she said.

Austin winked "Oh go on, live a little" he said.

"Oh all right" sighed Tonks. "Cone on Harry, you need to get back home!"
