Are there any good fics that take the first few pages of Cursed Child and run with it?

I really hated Cursed Child. However, I thought the characters introduced in the first few pages (Albus, Severus, and Rose) were pretty appealing and I would read something where they actually studied at Hogwarts instead of ridiculous time travel shenanigans.


** There are plenty of next-generation stories, which are based on this premise. E.g., “Raindrops on Roses by backinyourbox” linkao3(373224), “Roses Trilogy by Realmer06” starting with linkao3(837413), “Inter Arma... by Pitry” linkao3(369727). “The Divide by Beedle” linkffn(13022404) is not exactly that (only main characters from the Weasley clan are Hermione's ones), but it is so lovely story, I will recommend it nevertheless.

  Beginning immediately after the Epilogue, this story follows Scorpius, Rose and Albus through their Hogwarts years and beyond. Childish fears and desires soon turn to more serious dilemmas as some members of the Ravenclaw trio are forced to grow up too soon. Albus wants to be remembered for being something other than Harry Potter's son. Scorpius knows his father expects him to follow in his footsteps, but how long can he keep his friends, his music and his OWL in Muggle Studies a secret? And Rose has yet to decide what she wants...

  Two friends. Two families. One question. One fight. Three years of separation. When Rose and Scorpius are thrown together again, can they figure out what went wrong before it's too late to regain what they lost? And is that really what they want? (Part 1 of the Roses Trilogy, an offshoot of the Pieces Universe)
