  She was supposed to be an insane witch who murdered for fun, a remorseless bitch out of her mind. Someone certainly not to fuck with. But Bellatrix is a true daughter of Black. When she realizes her cousin's goddaughter is abused, she takes the Girl in as her own. Rated M for language, gore, sexually explicit details. This is really not a story for kiddies.
