I've recently discovered the works of Ell Roch/Ellory on AO3 and I've been obsessed with them. I've done some (poor) google digging on my own, and found that some of their work on the pureblood series is gone from the internet? If someone has them, would you be kind enough to share? I've discovered Pureblood Roulette by Neellok as well, and google didn't help me much beyond that - so are there more of their fics, too? (please share, if you don't mind)

On another note, any fic that centers around pureblood traditions or customs is fine with me. I'm just really yearning for it, actually. (I'm on the last stretch of final's week and I really need a pick me up T_T)


** Someone else recommended this earlier this week and i've been consumed for the past three days. I'm on book 3 out of 4 now and the 4th is still being updated. It's been really good and super original. Lots of secrets, in-depth magic and intrigue. Tom rRddle is leader of an opposing pureblood political movement and they've passed through laws making so only purebloods can attend Hogwarts. Give it a try! linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense)

** Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10678911/chapters/23643603]])

This is my favorite depiction of pureblood culture. It's not better or worse than muggle culture, just different and a bit alien.

It's also one of the few stories with sympathetic Snape or Draco that seem to actually be built on redemption of truly awful people rather than ignoring how awful they are.

  Blood magic was supposed to keep Harry safe, but his relatives are expendable. Blood magic was supposed to keep Harry looking like his adoptive father, but it's wearing off. Blood is a bond, but so is the memory of hate -- or love.

  When a more studious Harry Potter entered Gringotts with Hagrid, the Goblins managed to talk to him privately - Dumbledore never saw that one coming. A Ravenclaw Harry story. Warning: child abuse, character bashing, and pureblood society.
