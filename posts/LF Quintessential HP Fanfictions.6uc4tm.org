So, my boyfriend recently discoved a love for HP fanfiction after I asked him to read a few stories I had written and recommended a few of my personal favourites. He's never read any fanfiction before, so I'm attempting to give him a crash course in this craziness. Looking for suggestions of definitive/must read pieces in any genre, any pairings; send us your favourites, your guilty pleasures, your craziest crack-fics, strangest crossovers, from the sweetest romances to the smuttiest of harems, the so-bad-it's-good and the nope-it's-just-straight-bad. Complete only please, any length and any rating is fine.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]], linkffn(10677106): Generally can't go wrong with that one

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]]: If he cares more about characters and a good plot than magic, this is the FIC to read.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167): Excellent postwar story in which Harry and his friends began a revolution to overthrow the incorrigible Pureblood tyranny.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185): If he likes politics, wars, strategies, and tactics, this is the FIC to read.
