I'd just started a story and hadn't bookmarked it yet, and my phone freaked out. When I rebooted the link want in my history.

A former lawyer was in a bad car wreck, and gets nabbed by the moiria to fix a problem. (There was a line about how much room for sarcasm the gates had with a six word vocabulary and the ability to produce images, or something very close to that.) He ends up an invisible ghost in the closet with a kid, and on investigating discovers it's Harry Potter (which is fiction in his world). That's as far as is gotten.

  "Fix it" said the Fates. "Fix what? With what tools and skills?" I asked. Being dead was only the first of the obstacles. And then I found myself in an understairs cupboard listening to a little boy quietly sobbing. Oh. Fix THAT. In which a sarcastic old git is dropped into the awful childhood of Harry Potter. SI-ish. Rated M for foul language and canon-level abuse.
