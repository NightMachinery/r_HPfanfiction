** Accidental magic is a really weird thing. Like seriously weird.

Malcom O'Conner is still famous over 700 years later for wishing his mom could talk to him one more time after she died while he was young.

Her portrait springing to life became to cornerstone of magical portrait creation.

Ivan Ivanovic Ivanov was so proud of his name as a child that 300 years later some variation of his name is still the most common name in all of Russia.

It is believed that the entirety of red haired people came from a young preteen witch millennia ago who was angry enough for her hair to turn red.

Like I said, accidental magic is weird.

Alice in Wonderland, entirely based on a young witches deep desire to escape reality so she jumped a few dimensions sideways and had her adventure.

Really weird.

So was it any surprise that a young wizard at age 4 wished nothing more than to follow the wonderful woman who said that everyone on his ship was family to her?

No, that's far from uncommon. Many safe little children wish for better.

Few, small enough to just be this side of a non-zero number, decide to step into their families television set to join said family though.

So here we are. Stardate [2371] and suddenly Janeway finds a strange little mostly human boy on her command deck. A young boy with remarkable powers and an desire for family.

Raised in a dangerous environment where every week was a new test of survival he could not afford to let himself become idle. With so many powerful beings playing with his home he grew into a driven young man.

He learned the mind arts from his Ocampa friend. How to organize his mind through Vulcan meditation and logic. Those two brought about a near exponential increase in his learning ability. He wasn't really all that smarter than anyone else. He just learned things the first time and didn't really forget them. Understanding what he learned took the longest.

He learned the art of haggling and storytelling, how to fly and drive damn near anything, hours spent learning medical from literally the greatest medical minds of the federation combined into a single person.

He bargained with godlike beings, played games with Q the likes of which frequently killed him. It was okay because Q always brought him back to life.

He learned to art of solar surfing and warp theory. He learned a lot about ship maintenance and emergency repairs. Being tiny made getting to hard to reach places easy.

That he could withstand forces that would easily grievously harm other only helped him present his case when he first made it.

So used to the insanity of his life in the Delta Quadrant that he was lost and confused when they made their way home eventually. He had seen the death of thousands first hand, seen planets burn, alien creatures flying through space large enough to dwarf the Voyager. In his short 7 years aboard the Voyager he had seen such wonders and horrors that it was just his life at that point.

He had more pending commendations waiting for him, as did most of the crew, than most war time Admirals could dream of.

What was he supposed to do now? He would turn 11 a few days from now and there was no place for him yet.

He missed the excitement of living on the edge. His favorite adoptive family member had said he would grow out of it eventually.

Sure Star Fleet had set him up with a great place on Earth. Didn't matter though to him. His knowledge and skills were more than enough for him to blow through the Academies courses with little difficulty.

Still he was only almost 11 and that wasn't really an option for him yet.

Then his favorite family member showed up. The one who said he had 'potential'. Considering Uncle Q viewed humans as interesting and cute little pets, him having 'potential' meant he could some day reach the levels of the collective.

So he got to spend a few seconds/decades/days/time and reality are constructs of lesser minds, playing and exploring his powers with his uncle Q.

"Hey kiddo, bored huh? I've got a game for you."

He felt his eyes lighting up at the smirk uncle Q had on his face. The last game he had played that started with that smirk they wound up sinking a dyson sphere into a super massive black hole. He still giggled at the scream of pure rage the leader of the aliens had made as he sat there eating ice cream as it collapsed.

It seemed fair enough to Harry, seeing as how the aliens had violated the one rule he carried above all others. Laughter keeps the universe running.

Really it did, he had multidimensional charts and cross temporal resonance imaging that proved it. Really, Star Fleet was still trying to prove that wrong and he had sent that thesis on to them about 2 years ago.

So an entire species that was devoid of humor was entirely fair game to sink into a black hole. It was for the good of the universe after all. Also their poetry was horrible.

"Yes, don't care, let's play!"

Q smiled and held out a strange letter addressed to him

*His Princely Grace the Son of Heaven and High Charge of the Q Continuum Harry James Potter*

*Imperial Suite*

*42 Infinity Way*

*Federation Headquarters, Alpha Quadrant*

Harry opened the envelope, gave it a read and had to laugh. He laughed until it hurt he laughed so hard.

He had learned of his home reality. Uncle Q had taken him there a few times to observe the history of that reality.

The both found it funny and depressing how little of their potential the self-styled wizards and witches of that reality used. They squandered far more potential then they ever began to use.

It took him a few minutes to lock onto that reality and create an arch to it. Uncle Q checked it over and gave him the greenlight.

They stepped and he confirmed he could find the Beacon for the reality he had just left.

After he had gotten lost once and smashed through a couple dozen realities trying to find his way back home uncle Q had helped him build a reality beacon.
