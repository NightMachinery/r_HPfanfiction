Hello!

As the title says, I have much experience writing fiction and non fiction and typically work with entirely original material. I have only recently got into the HP fandom after an absence of over a decade so the contours are somewhat unclear to me. I know the basics about Lippet and other big series, the infamy of My Immortal and the basic lore of the fandom but otherwise I would appreciate knowing what people seek in fan fiction and what new authors should be aware of.

My planned work, currently a few thousand words in, is about 80-90% original characters and settings and mostly in the Muggle world. Working title is 'The Mugs'. Are there things to avoid or be aware of for stories that deal with or involve Muggles?

Thank you so much for your help!


** Welcome (back) to the fandom. I feel somewhat qualified to address your query, given that I've played in both fanfiction and original fiction (I've sold twenty or so pieces of the latter) and have 100+ nonfiction articles to my name. In terms of advice:

If a character is well established in canon (Harry, Hermione, Ron, Neville, Dumbledore, Snape, Draco, etc.) and you aren't departing meaningfully from their canon portrayals, don't waste words on lengthy character descriptions or walking us through how a character thinks if it could be reasonably guessed at by knowing canon. All prospective readers will be completely familiar with this and your efforts are better spent on other aspects of storytelling. This is a bit of convenience fanfiction writers have that original fiction writers don't.

Avoid setting up a situation where Muggles pwn everything magical. This rarely makes for a good story and more often than not pisses off readers who read Harry Potter fanfiction because they enjoy reading about magic.

Slash stories should be telegraphed well before the point of insertion.

Try to find a unique angle for your story. With a million or so HP fanfiction stories out there, it isn't easy, but it will probably give you more views.

Read the tongue-in-cheek DLP [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=8086][Potter Laws]] to get a sense of a few of the clichés out there that might be avoided.

I agree with this with the caveat that muggles shouldn't be portrayed as inferior either. There are things that technology is simply far better at than magic such as communication and information distribution. Technology put a man on the moon. So many fics go too far in one direction or the other.

Also, as a side note, I'm really starting to detest the argument that "writers shouldn't do X because readers like reading about magic". I feel like I've seen it used pretty frequently lately.

****** Arthur Weasley, working in the government department in charge of cursed Muggle devices, isn't said to be incompetent at any point. In fact, wizards seem dismissive of his Muggle device obsession despite his job. Yet he knows pathetically little about them after years if not /decades/ at the job.

If wizarding society is that way after /centuries/ of uninterrupted social order and supposed advancement, it doesn't seem likely to change and is practically a wilful part of their presented cultural identity.

That points to the /society/ of magicals in general being pretty hopeless about Muggle knowledge, even if some Muggle-born /obviously/ know way more than that.

******* I don't think this is the only (or even the most likely) way to interpret this part of canon.

Despite being "pretty hopeless about Muggle knowledge," Wizarding society nevertheless remains effectively invisible to Muggles, with all their surveillance equipment, IR goggles, closed circuit television, cameras, camcorders, the Internet, and whatnot. While commercial GPS, a.k.a. "Unplottable locales and the Fidelius mean nothing to me," wasn't in place by the end of the series, it was only a few years out and one suspects the Wizarding world had plans for how to handle it.

My head canon treats much of what we see in the stories as emblematic. For instance, Dursley abuse is very likely hyperbole, a story told for emotive and comic effect by the author to, as [[/u/Taure]] notes, make the contrast between Muggle and Magical worlds seem greater to the reader.

Similarly, Arthur may be playing up his purported lack of Muggle knowledge as a private joke, a bit of affected eccentricity, and not genuine ignorance. It would be a Columbo-esque, disarming way of learning about the Muggle world through asking seemingly innocent questions without setting off warning bells (aside from "this guy is weird"). It certainly makes more sense to interpret things this way--and, as a meta-point, considering it another instance of JKR's penchant for humor over strict logic--than imagining that despite maintaining a pronounced personal and professional interest, Arthur remains utterly ignorant of the Muggle world throughout his decades of exposure and immersion. (He does deal with Muggles in his day-to-day.) Muggleborn children somehow are capable of navigating the Magical world in a few years, yet a qualified Wizard can't figure out how to use a 'fellotone' after decades? I don't buy it. The guy would have to be the world's biggest moron (for which there's little evidence in canon).

If this is Arthur's natural behavior around Muggles and Muggle-born/-raised in his day job, it's plausible to me that he might naturally fall into a similar pattern during his off hours. As an example of what I mean, I know a former CIA officer of twenty years with the agency who reflexively "handles" her social contacts in, one imagines, much the same way as she did her agents in her day job. If you know what to look for, it's clear how she's manipulating and steering conversations and interactions with her social contacts, though it's very smooth, very subtle. I honestly don't think she even knows she's doing it anymore, the patterns being so ingrained.

We don't know if the bubble-head charm would work in a vacuum, if a warming charms are strong enough, if a broom could maintain a constant acceleration high enough to break free of Earth's gravity, if shield charms would protect you from radiation, if there's anything magic could do to let you survive reentry, etc.

We know the Firebolt is capable of going 150km/hour from PoA. We don't know if that's it's maximum speed, but it gives us a ballpark figure. 106 days was derived from that.

To [[/u/denarli]] (whose post I totally did read, honest) I'd only say that writing HP fanfiction just for the sake of trashing the magical world went out of fashion about 8 or 10 years ago. I don't think the advice given is unsound or inappropriate.

** I'd suggest trying to keep the canon characters' personalities mostly intact, and build on top of the canon's magical system instead of introducing an entirely different one. These, I think, are the two main things that keep a fanfic relevant to Harry Potter universe and to the majority of HP fanfic readers' interests. Otherwise it feels like an alien story that only tries to disguise itself as an HP fanfic. This is, of course, only my opinion.

Then you need to give harry an awesome power, like, a giant human shaped patronus that can kill dementors, dual animagus form one being a dragon and the other Naruto's Nine tailed fox

Then you need to get him chicks, and the more the better, so get every named female character into his harem excet Ginny fuck that bitch.

Now you need to get him some really good dosh which is easy, just have him make freinds with goblins! so he can open the Potter family vaults where he finds sirius will' so he can now become Lord Potter Black Gryffindor Prevell

Seriously, if there's anything lacking in more recent fanfiction is the sense of fun with magic. Most use it to turn Harry into a power fantasy, some just barely nod towards it like a replacement for technological conveniences. Many don't even bother bringing it up as they're focused on the relationships between the known characters.

What we need are more stories like [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4563439/1/Ectomancer][Ectomancer]], [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8596476/1/Starnlicht][Starnlicht]], and [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/9860311/1/A-Long-Journey-Home][A Long Journey Home]], where magic is hinted to be so much more than what we've seen so far.

** Like _Pers said, avoid making muggles superior in everything. (The "but a pen is so much more practicable than a quill" annoys quite a few readers by now.)

Generally I'd say it's harder to get readers if you have many OCs and if the story takes place mostly in the muggle world. I don't know any popular ones like that, e.g., but if your plot is interesting and the writing good I don't see why yours shouldn't be the first. To garner more attention you can either recommend your own story here or maybe post it on darklordpotter.net in the work by author section - the second option has the advantage that you usually get more qualified feedback there than on ffnet (where reviews usually consist of a cry for MOAR).

I guess I don't have to mention it if you usually work with original fiction, but character bashing (manipulative but incompetent Dumbledore, money stealing Weasleys) is not very popular.

If Harry is your main character, I think readers prefer him to be more competent/talented/hard working than in canon.
