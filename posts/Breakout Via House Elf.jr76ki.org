:END:
So I started Re-reading linkao3(20054596) and a house elf actually shows up in Azkaban.

Here's the prompt, What if a random House of Potter Elf came along and Broke out Sirius not long after his imprisonment started? Same goes for breaking out Harry, from the Dursleys. It could be Either, but I'm more interested in Sirius bth, he can go get Harry later, or tell the elf, whatever works. This prompt assumes Sirius was formally/magically adopted into the Potter Family, so their elves would listen to him. I'm aware of linkao3(14758079). Not what Im looking for.

As for the request, Are there any fics where Sirius escapes azkaban via House elf? In the story I mentioned above, the elf(Mopsy) doesn't take them anywhere, because Bella opened her big mouth. But if there are any stories where this happens, they be welcome. Thanks. It doesn't have to be a Ptter elf here, any House elf would do.

  Sirius was thrown into Azkaban for the Murder of James and Lily Potter. Sirius had sadly accepted his fate and was ready to spent his remaining days in the locked cells, but sometimes fate and dead wonderful best friend and his wife likes to meddle. a spell performed for the safety of his godson, Harry, by James and Lily transports Harry into the Azkaban tower at the mere age of just 17 months.Sirius can only hope for the best as his godson clings to him tightly. Along with Harry and some unexpected prison mates, Sirius sets on an adventure that is sure to change the lives of not only his mismatched family but the wizarding world as whole.

  Halloween 1981 and the Potter family has been attacked. But when Sirius arrives, the crib is empty. Harry is missing, presumed dead, but Mipsy knows the truth. She takes care of little master just as Lord Potter's portrait commands her to.
