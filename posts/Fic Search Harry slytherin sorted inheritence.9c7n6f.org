I wish to find the title of a fanfiction that I have lost : Harry hides his hogwarts letter, go to diagon alley alone and to gringotts where he has a inheritence test before going to Hogwarts and made aware of his lordshiips and custom. Sorted in slytherin. But he acts like a Gryffondor by going after the dark lord.


** I mean... this is a such a common trope it could be any of a large, large number of fics. You would need to be more specific.

  Harry Potter finally snaps after being treated like a slave by the Dursleys. With a bit of accidental magic and a dash of luck, he stumbles upon a unique snake. Bonded and armed with peculiar powers, Harry walks away from Privet Drive to the Wizarding World. Now he's at Hogwarts, and no one knows what exactly or, who exactly is Harry Potter.
