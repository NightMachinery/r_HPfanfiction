Indy!Ron time!


** Indy Ron actually makes more sense from their canon flaws. Harry always wanted a family, while Ron desired to stand out from his. An independent Ron would likely grow more than an independent Harry would.

Harry's been independent from since he was born until he met Ron, and he said to hell with going back.

*** Yeah it used to bother me a lot that Ron wants to stand out so bad but never seems to put in any work towards that until he started practising for quidditch on 5th/6th year.

But it makes sense, plenty of people have goals so lofty that they seem impossible so it seems pointless to start. It also doesn't help that Ron doesn't seem to have a natural talent or drive towards many things. That isn't meant as a dig, not everyone has innate drive like Hermione for learning or Harry's talent for quidditch. It just means he'd have to really work at it, which unfortunately isn't his thing.

So if you just make him a bit more driven and dedicated you can get a pretty brilliant Ron who actually has to work for achievements without just being born with a genius or with loads of money.

And because I'm sure this came across as bashing Ron at some point and probably was I just want to repeat that these kinds of flaws are natural and make a character more realistic and he makes up for it in my opinion with his humour, bravery, and loyalty.

** I have no idea the name, but there was one that had shades of this. I think 4th year Harry got sent back in time to his 1st year body before the troll. Not really thinking, Harry told Ron to stop being an asshole, that Hermione was his friend. Then he got sent back to his own time.

Butterfly Effect in full force, Ron became tight with Seamus and Dean and was quite popular. Harry ended up mainly hanging with Hermione and the quidditch team.

** *The Ravenclaw Explorer's Guild.*

I looked up from the book I was reading. Hogwarts, a History, ironically enough. Hermione's little contribution to my survival while Harry was going through triwizard tournament preparations.

Yeah, I screwed up big time on that one. In my defence, though, I wasn't really pissed off at Harry. He just happened to be around when I vented. I didn't mean to vent at him, honest. Pissing him off turned out to be a bad idea.

So here I was. Stuck trying to figure out how to say sorry to my best friend while everyone just kind of watched from the sidelines after our little spat in the common room. I got sick of the constant attention and, next thing I know, I am following Hermione's advice and reading up stuff in the library.

Being gawked at by some girl whose name I didn't even know. "Yes?" I asked her as I looked up to still see her staring at me after five minutes.

"What are you doing here?" The girl asked.

"Reading. What does it look like?" I grumbled, already feeling the now-familiar sensation of my ears turning red.

"Glaring at a book like it murdered your friends." She retorted sharply, having picked up on something in my tone.

"Well no. That's the DADA professor's thing, not mine." I said, going back to re-reading the sentence I had been focusing on. It was pretty wild, this book. You don't really get how useful the dungeons here can be until you pick through the stories this place has to offer. No wonder Hermione loved it. She'd probably already written up the section that will talk about us.

The girl was still staring at me when I turned the page. "What?"

"Why are you reading it?" The girl asked.

"Why do you want to know?" I retorted.

She tapped her tie. Ravenclaw colors. Well that explained it.

"Trying to get ahead on some stuff." I answered. "I'm pretty sure Harry's in danger from something in Hogwarts and I am trying to figure out what it is. Hence why I am reading up on the section about where the dangerous artifacts are stored and if someone managed to get to the Goblet of Fire before it was brought out."

"And what will that do?" The Ravenclaw asked.

"Well, if I can prove that the Goblet could have been tampered with before the tournament was announced, then Hermione can do her thing and get Harry out of having to participate altogether." I admitted.

"Sounds a bit far-fetched." The girl said. "I mean, in order to do that, you would have to get to where the Goblet of Fire was stored without setting off any alarms and leave, say, a note saying that if you could do it, anyone else could have."

I nodded. That had been Hermione's plan alright. Problem was that Harry wasn't going to play ball until I apologised and I was having the hardest time just being in a room with him right now. Odds were that Harry will have already competed by the time I got around to doing that, which would mean he accepted the contract and all this will have been for nothing. I want to say sorry, I really do, it's just-well, every time I try, I... fizzle. Maybe I wasn't cut out to be a Gryffindor after all.

I shrugged instead of saying anything. I really didn't need Hermione to be even more on my case than she will be come next week.

"I've got a plan for that." I said glumly. Listening to Bill and Charlie debate enchantments on top of my own experience with this kind of stuff meant that getting that sorted out was child's play between me and Hermione. She did the theoretical, I edited it until it was practical. Bound to fail, really, but it would work beautifully until it didn't.

"Then what's stopping you?" She asked.

"I need more people." I said, evading the topic of what people I was talking about. Harry. Hermione. Neville in a pinch. Draco for comic relief, even. Anything but the idea of trying this for myself, which I could do but really didn't want to.

The girl looked at me. "My name is Lisa Turpin. I handle the more... active aspects of Ravenclaw's research proposals. Dungeon diving, Forestry field trips, buying from the muggle world, all that. Normally I'd offer my services for a fee, but for you Mister Weasley?" She stopped, frowning.

"For me what?" I prompted.

"Well, you have a reputation as an adventuring sort, right? I give you some people and equipment, you get into the artifacts storage area of the dungeons and get out whilst leaving a note like you intended to /and/ write up how you did it... and I will pay you five hundred galleons for it."

I stared at her.

"Ravenclaw looks after its own mister Weasley." Lisa said with a smug smile. "And you will find that we have very deep pockets for people who do more than sit around reading books when there are mysteries to be solved. Very deep ones indeed."

Five hundred galleons... People... Maybe even curse-breaking equipment? It sounded too good to be true. It probably was too good to be true. But then again, getting Harry out of this tournament without having to risk their necks as well as mine sounded like the kind of apology even he couldn't say no to.

It was a chance and I had blown far too many of those as of late.

"You know what, Miss Turpin? I'll do it." I answered with a smile.

"Good." She said whilst grabbing a seat. "Now, tell me about this plan you have."

And so I did. It was both the best and worst decision I ever made.

He knew he was endangering them, and god knows what the horcrux was whispering to him.

The fact that he immediately tried to go back once he had cooled off and tried to return doesn't count for anything at all, though?

Ron has a way higher breaking point than most people do, and the first chance, the first opportunity that he had to try to redeem himself, he took that chance, and dived into a freezing cold pond to save Harry's life, and then quite literally slayed his inner demons and destroyed the Horcrux that caused him to lash out in the first place.

*** Maybe Harry stops Ron from being the Master of Chudley Canon xd. To be fair, Ron is a representation of most of our 11 year old selves (including me). Pity, he always stayed the same though.

** Totally canon:

- In his first year, Ron had an inherited wand. When others were levitating feathers, Ron was levitating troll clubs. When our resident genius was cowering in fear and our resident hero was using his wand as nasal cleaning instrument, Ron did the only intelligent thing.
- In his second year, Ron had a /broken/ wand. He still passed all his classes.
- In the Mirror of Erised, Harry saw a family; Ron saw ambition.

It wasn't his fault that Harry was such a high-maintenance friend.

I am not 100% sure whether I am being ironic or serious here.

*** Finally someone says it!! It's so not in character for him to do that. He would never abandon a friend, especially not ron, he loves him so much. He was his first friend and he is too scared of losing him (especially after book 4 when he experienced life without him for a few good weeks).

**** It doesn't mean harry will do the same lol. Also you're being too harsh on ron, he was an asshole for doing that but he loves harry with his whole heart, just like harry loves him. He didn't leave harry because he didn't care about him (he always cared), he left harry because of his own insecurities, it's not an excuse but still. And he always came back.

**** I'm tired to repeat this argument but :

- 4th year : Ron was not jealous about Harry participating into the Tournament. He was angry because he thought Harry had found a way to enter his name in the Goblet and didn't share it with him, he thought he was left behind. Which is stupid but comprehensible for a 14 years old.\\
  Also, their dispute would not have nearly as long if Harry had also not decided to vent. Ron would have been by his side the next day if Harry had just said "Moody think someone put my name in the Goblet in the hope it kills me, the usual" rather than "You are an idiot". Pretty sure throwing a badge to his head didn't help the name he talked to Sirius. Both acted like stupid 14 years old and that's fine because they were at that age.
- 7th year : People seem to forget that Harry (and Hermione) were also under the influence of the Horcruxe, and that Harry litterally told Ron he could leave. Ron went ouside to vent, and if not for his encounter with Snatchers (and Harry decision to leave the moment Ron was out), he would have been back the same day. People also forget that Ron while Ron was homesick, Ron was also the one taking the most risk in their group. Harry or Hermione capture meant their death, Ron capture meant his death, and the one of his whole family.

What Harry says: "Listen," said Harry, "I didn't put my name in that goblet. Someone else must've done it. "

Harry says "you're doing a really good job of it (being stupid)" after telling Ron twice he didn't put his name in.

The selection is on the 31st of October. The tournament on the 24th. Sirius and Harry speak just a few days before. Ron refused to speak to Harry for three weeks. It's still 3 weeks if Harry doesn't throw the badge.

I like Ron and I don't like bashing him, but this fandom has shifted from bashing to attempting to justify his every action. Ron abandoned Harry here and there's little to nothing Harry could have done to change that.

**** That's not what I said, I said /Harry/ would never abandon /Ron/, not that Ron would never abandon Harry. Though I would say that in situations where they step away from each other, cool heads would always prevail in the end, because they love each other, even though they can both hold a grudge.

** This just made me realize, like, why did Ron adopt Harry as best friend? Like. They just met and instantly became best friends, and that worked? What if Ron is just like, a friend monster who adapts himself into the best friend of whatever he comes across.

Like say Harry rejects Ron. Ron moves down, becomes best friends with Terry Boot. Now Ron is study machine, puzzle lovin' Ravenclaw man. Draco presumably has rejected him before, but say he comes across Theo Nott. Now he is super polite Slytherin dude.
