  Inspired by a post on Tumblr, this is a AU story set during Harry's sixth year at Hogwarts, with one big, foul-mouthed difference. Instead of Horace Slughorn, the position of Potions professor will be taken on by...Gordon Ramsay.

** I'd rather a story with a muggle celeb and all th muggleborns flipping their shit and Harry's pleased as punch because no one is paying attention to him as even the purebloods get caught up trying to figure out why everyone is losing it over some weird muggleborns.
