As the title says I wanna see what your top 5 fics are?

Personally my top five are the following

1.Fates gamble. By Lupine Horror. A crossover fic with the fate universe, whilst it probably doesn't hold up as much anymore it is what got me started on reading Harry Potter fics Linkffn(Fate's Gamble)

1. Make a wish. By Rorschach's Blot. This is a crack fic where Harry decides to leave Britain to explore the world before he dies to voldemort. Linkffn(Make a Wish)

2. His angel. By Durararaa. This is a romance fic where it is flower pot, was very cute but unfortunately it got discontinued. Linkffn(His angel by Durararaa)

3. Barefoot. By zaxaramas. This was a very unique premise where Harry walks around barefoot due to an ability that he was born with. Linkffn(Barefoot)

4. Core threads. By theaceoffire. This is once again a more unique take on magic. Harry can see the magic in his body as if they are threads of string. Linkffn(Core Threads)

P. S if links don't work ill fix them when I'm home.


** 1. The Boys of Crowhill: best Remus I've ever read yet. linkao3(The Boys of Crowhill)
2. My heart is a fist of barbed wire: best manipulative, obsessed, possessive Tom, the only realistic way he could ever be in a relationship. linkao3(My heart is a fist of barbed wire)
3. Harry Potter and The Enemy Within: best mentor!Snape I've read yet. linkffn(Harry Potter and the Enemy Within)
4. If death is a doorway, I am gate seeker: best Lily I've read yet. linkao3(If death is a doorway, I'm gate seeker)
5. Crime and Punishment: another great mentor!Snape linkao3(Crime and Punishment by melolcatsi)

  The note pinned to his collar read 'Harry J Potter - please accept'. The Dursleys had left him with nothing else but a pillow sack with half a sleeve of McVities biscuits, a mealy apple, and ten pounds.

  "Now I have three heads: one for speech, one for sex, and one for second guessing." - Analicia Sotelo. 'South Texas Persephone'.Her door clicks open and nearly clips her in the face. It could be a sudden draft, but Amy is doubtful. Her fist clenches shut around the marble. It is pretty. She could look at it for hours, the way it catches the light. It's almost like a sweet. Want curls up in her chest like a cat. She thinks she'll keep it. A gift from the big grey orphanage, just to her.“That's mine,” comes a thin, cold voice, and she sees the boy across the hall for the first time. His room is directly across from hers. He is pretty, she thinks, like a drawing from a book. The lines of his face are smooth and pale. His hair is dark and neatly parted. He holds himself very rigidly, like a miniature soldier or a wind-up toy. “That's mine,” he repeats, sharply.(In which Tom Riddle is not the only strange child to come out of Wool's.)

  "The sorrow birds find what is weak, my chest, beak-marked, my eyes long gone." - Ann V. DevilbissLily Potter is dead.No.Lily Potter should be dead.The cheerful little owl clock on top of the dresser hesitates, then ticks onward. The baby in the crib sucks in another eager breath, and wails anew. The dead girl on the floor- the should be dead girl on the floor- opens her eyes.(Lily lives, but sometimes wishes she hadn't.)

  Harry is accused of burglary. The Dursleys leave him to rot. Dumbledore sends Snape to remedy the situation. Harry finds himself in the care of an irate Snape. Not slash, gen-fic w/ focus on Sevitus relationship. Angst galore. Warnings: coarse and suggestive language, mentions of abuse/neglect. Un-betaed and un-Britpicked.

  AU: When Voldemort attacked the Potters on Halloween night, she not only created a living legend in Charlus Potter, the Boy-Who-Lived, but she touched the life of another just as deeply.

  Harry is fully prepared to face the basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets to save Ginny. Unfortunately, he never gets a chance.

  Neglected in favour of his younger brother, Harry Potter always was dissatisfied. His Parents and their friends fawned over Thomas, no matter what the older brother did. Harry upped and left; why would he have stayed? 6 years later, Harry Potter found a new home. The boy is in the middle of it all, though. What will his role be? Where will his allegiance lie?

Harry will take Hogwarts and his 'family' by storm and by the time the 'light' realize their mistake it will be too late for them to fix. OOC!Dark!Powerful!Harry.

  There was no troll in the girls bathroom in 1991. Hermione found no friends that night. Therefore the brightest witch of her age is on a perilous path. Because with magic it is so very true that knowledge is power. But is it also true that power corrupts? Will the only daughter of two dentists become the third Dark Lord that rises in Dumbledore's lifetime?

  Harry has worked for years as an Unspeakable to identify the best point where he might go back in time to change the impact of Voldemort's war. Now he knows: he will have to return to his parents' Hogwarts years and encourage the Slytherins to stand on their own instead of following a leader. He knows how to assume the post of Defense professor and how to reach the Slytherins. And from there, well, surely nothing can go too wrong.

1) !linkao3(Of a Linear Circle by Flamethrower) . Just... Wow. 11 books. So much history and intrigue and lore. They built a world and it's incredible.

2) !linkao3(All the Young Dudes by MsKingBean69) My favourite Marauder fic. Best Remus. Best OC. I want to marry Grant.

3) !linkffn(The Life and Times by Jewel5) Cult classic but eugh DAMN this was SO GOOD!!! Brilliant James and Lily and so much drama!

4) !linkao3(Remain in Light by veeagainst) Best Remus and Sirius after OoTP. Really good insight into the war and what the Order was doing while Harry was off galavanting.

5) !linkao3(Practical Applications of Arithmancy by JanuaryGrey) A one shot of Sirius telling Orion why he dropped Arithmancy and the consequences. I love Black Family stories. And this one is the most realistic I've found.
