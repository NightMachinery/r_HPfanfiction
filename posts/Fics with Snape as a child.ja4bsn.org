With the amount of Snape-centric fics there are out there, I've had trouble finding ones where he's a kid.

I'm good with a fic about his childhood, de-aging fics, or even time travel fics.

I've only come across two like this so far: linkao3(House Potter for Children in Need) linkffn(UnVeiled by Snapegirlkmf)

  Eight-year-old Severus Snape wakes up alone at home only to be later dumped in another house. There, he must put up with an annoying toddler, a creepy cat and two adults that cannot be trusted.The place is Godric's Hollow and the year, 1981 ---except for the fact that Severus thinks it is 1968.

  After the Second Wizard War, the Veil turned inward and spat out a few familiar faces-as children! Severus, Sirius, and Lily get a second chance to live their lives over again. What things will change, and what will stay the same? With Harry as Sev's guardian, Remus as Sirius', & Lily has a surprise new family. AU!
