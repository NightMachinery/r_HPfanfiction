#+begin_quote
  Draco awakens to find himself in an unfamiliar place, having apparently committed an unspeakable crime, with no wand, and no memory of how he got there. Will he save his victim from certain death, or will he be the heartless killer everyone has believed him to be? Nominated for "Best Multi-Chapter Story" in the Deathly Hallows Awards - December 2010. Please note that this work is NOT for the faint of heart. Very dark.
