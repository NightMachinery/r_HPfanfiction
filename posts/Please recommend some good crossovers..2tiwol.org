Fics I have read (and enjoyed):

So, I've read a lot of crossovers (more than is listed, definitely). Basically, I want something that's been posted fairly recently, or is outside of my usual fandoms.

*HP/Avengers:*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8212843/1/I-See-The-Moon][I See the Moon]]

#+begin_quote
  Gen. "While on the run, Bruce meets a young man who speaks to the moon. He's probably not quite the sanest friend Bruce could have made, but, well...beggers can't be choosers."
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10524028/1/The-Observer-Effect][The Observer Effect]]

#+begin_quote
  After Tony Stark outs himself as Iron Man on live television, he acquires a magical stalker in the form of a bored (female) Harry Potter, who has emerged from the Veil of Death in a world without wizards. A cat-and-mouse game ensues when Stark's curiosity drives him to ever-increasing lengths to capture his invisible benefactor, who struggles with maintaining her distance.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9625555/1/Birds-of-a-Feather][Birds of a Feather]]

#+begin_quote
  Tiboldt's Family Circus brings together two birds of a feather. The world tries to tear them apart.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8177168/1/Wand-and-Shield][Wand and Shield]]

#+begin_quote
  The world is breaking; war and technology are pushing on the edge of the unbelievable, and S.H.I.E.L.D. desperately attempts to keep the peace. The soldier and the scientist are not the only lights that push back against the darkness, however; magic will encompass the world again as the last wizard makes himself known.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8410168/1/Steve-And-The-Barkeep][Steve and the Barkeep]]

#+begin_quote
  Steve has a routine, and god help him if he's going to break that routine for anyone - yes, that includes you, Tony. Enter a local barkeeper with a penchant for the occult and the gift of good conversation. EWE, not slash, just a couple of guys and a few hundred drinks. Rated for fear of the thought police.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8216900/1/Legal-Alien][Legal Alien]]

#+begin_quote
  Normal people didn't have to worry about this sort of thing when they go on vacation. They worry about things like losing their luggage, catching a cab or something similar. Not alien invasions. Harry, however, had never been normal. Then again, neither were these guys. One-shot
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8148717/1/Finding-Home][Finding Home]]

#+begin_quote
  When Harry finally accepted the fact that he had stopped aging, ten years had passed and he knew it was time to leave. AU.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8310486/1/Crestfallen][Crestfallen]]

#+begin_quote
  When Harry lands on Asgard, he doesn't expect to be besieged almost immediately by two gods and a giant wolf. But he's always been the adaptable sort. (No pairing.)
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10812693/1/Darkness-of-Birth][Darkness of Birth]]

#+begin_quote
  Howard Stark was remembered as a hero, but he was not a good man. Steve did not expect his friend's dark turn. He would never have believed it if it weren't for Tony's animosity, the certificate tucked into a forgotten drawer, and the photo of a baby with blonde hair and curious brown eyes.
#+end_quote

*HP/Ironman:*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4630585/1/Unified-Theory][Unified Theory]]

#+begin_quote

#+begin_quote
  With Voldemort defeated and Harry turning seventeen, the elder Weasley boys decide to give him a chance to be a normal teenager for a while; namely, by buying him a ticket to Malibu, California. But of course, Harry Potter can never do anything normally. Especially not once he meets Tony Stark in a club, and begins a holiday romance that leaves him with more than just memories.
#+end_quote

*HP/Attack on Titan:*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9872765/1/We-are-the-Hunters][We are the Hunters]]

#+begin_quote
  Something went wrong with Eren's father's experiment. Instead of turning into a Titan as he was supposed to, Eren woke up in the unfamiliar body of someone else who had just been through an incredibly traumatic experience. The infant Harry Potter. Rated for foul language in English and Japanese.
#+end_quote

*HP/Hobbit:*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10473466/1/Fate-be-Changed][Fate be Changes]]

#+begin_quote
  Reborn as a Hobbit, Willowyn Proudfoot isn't about to let a doughy potato like Bilbo Baggins get himself killed on Gandalf's hairbrained idea of an adventure. She's taking his place. For better or worse. (fem!Hobbit!Harry, major canon!divergence)
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10873705/1/This-Dream-s-On-Me][This Dream's On Me]]

#+begin_quote
  Fili has heard the whispers, between his uncle and his men. There's going to be a quest, a quest to reclaim Erebor and he wants in. The warrior witch he meets in his dreams doesn't seem to think it's a good idea for him to go though. At least, not alone. Eventual Fili x FemHarry
#+end_quote

*HP/LOTR:*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6086187/1/The-Promise-of-a-New-Dawn][The Promise of a New Dawn]]

#+end_quote

*HP/Death Note:*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10814641/1/Ritorukira][Ritorukira]]

#+begin_quote
  It was lucky he did this, for if he had not, another human would have found the Death Note. Ryuk would follow one old man for about a week before he freaked out and tried to burn the Death Note. Ryuk would be back in the Shinigami Realm, bored, Harry would go back to the Dursleys' home, malnourished, and everything would be... normal. Will not be finished, T for murder.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5730598/1/Martyrdom-and-Paradox][Martyrdom and Paradox]]

#+begin_quote
  L is deep in the Kira case when suddenly a man with a fake name and a sharp intellect turns up in Japan. As L discovers what attraction is, Harry Potter fights to help L solve the case while falling in love with the detective. Yaoi/slash. Rated mature!

#+end_quote

*HP/Hitman:*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8614847/1/Paradox][Paradox]]

#+begin_quote
  AU -- Reborn is too paranoid for his own good. It comes with the job. But then, encountering an unknown woman many times than is healthy has gained his suspicion. He needs to realize that sometimes, coincidences are just coincidences. One-shot. FemHarry.

#+end_quote

*HP/Naruto:*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8857635/1/Reborn-at-Hogwarts][Reborn at Hogwarts]]

#+begin_quote
  Honestly, none of them expected the dimension to collapse, other than Hidan. None of them expected to be reborn, with memories fully intact, in a different dimension. None of them expected to learn magic in this new world. None of them expected anything that happened. But it did.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10765546/1/The-Unbound-Soul][The Unbound Soul]]

#+begin_quote
  Ripped out of his world by an incomprehensible force on the night his parents died, young Harry Potter is cast into a world far different from that which he'd been born into. Bad luck and worse timing see the traumatized child falling into the hands of a man without scruples and his life is forever changed by the unethical experiments that are performed on him.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8615592/1/Piercing-Snow][Piercing Snow]]

#+begin_quote
  Dudley's innocent push starts Harry journey into Snow and beyond. An open wound grants him a wish. A mistake makes him the tool to the greatest man he had ever met. (A Harry is Haku story) Slash, violence, and a little bit of love.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5303127/1/En-Route][En Route]]

#+begin_quote
  Years after Voldemort's death, Harry and Luna's journey in search of mysterious objects lands them in the Hidden Countries. They must collect the lost pieces of a forgotten past while facing the world of ninjas. Things are going to be interesting...
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5852062/1/Multicolour-Post-Its][Multicolour Post Its]]

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter's animagus form is the Kyuubi no Yōko. And now he's stuck in a little boy named Naruto. So he helps the kid out. And boy is the kid hyperactive. Gen, WIP, AU.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3777014/1/A-Personal-Matter][A Personal Matter]]

#+begin_quote
  Two missions with drastic consequences. Worlds connect, destinies unravel, and nothing will ever be the same. HPxNTO crossover like you've never seen! Set pre series Harry Potter and Kakashi Gaiden Naruto.
#+end_quote

*HP/Avatar:*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9622291/1/Avatar][Avatar]]

#+begin_quote
  Harry defeated Voldemort with the power he knew not, a power far more valuable than his freedom. Sealed away until next he was needed, the Wizarding Saviour slept through the fall of his race, of magic and almost the world. Now he has been woken, the last avatar of a dead species and a being whose purpose is so old that only the bones of the Earth remember. (Not set during movie)
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6281862/1/Firefly][Firefly]]

#+begin_quote
  FINISHED. When they went to sleep, they hoped of a better future. But with Gaia insane and Magic as dead as his friends, Harry has no reason to stay. Escape and exist was all he had in mind when he stowed away on a ship to Pandora. Not another war. Slash.
#+end_quote

*HP/How to Train Your Dragon:*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10474336/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Time-He-Wasn-t-Actually-Harry-Potter][Harry Potter and the Time He Wasn't Actually Harry Potter]]

#+begin_quote
  ..wait, what? Harry Potter not himself? Well, when you factor in a skewed ritual done by a dead person, an evil wizard, and a time-traveling baby, it starts to make a little more sense. Maybe not to the students of Hogwarts, though, who are all a bit miffed that Harry Potter has somehow managed to enter himself into the Triwizard Tournament, despite being 1774 years in the past.
#+end_quote

*HP/Sherlock:*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6947125/1/A-Study-in-Magic][A Study in Magic]]

#+begin_quote
  When Albus Dumbledore shows up at Baker Street with strange demands and baby-filled picnic baskets, Sherlock Holmes is less than thrilled. Featuring Detective!Harry, Competent!Quirrell, and the world's only private consulting detective. No slash.
#+end_quote

*HP/Star Wars:*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7104491/1/Force-sensitive][Force sensitive]]

#+begin_quote
  At age eight, Harry Potter had an epiphany. He realized, with the utter certainty that only an eight years old can have, that he was a Jedi.
#+end_quote

*HP/Supernatural:*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5437211/1/You-Leave-the-World-Behind][You Leave the World Behind]]

#+begin_quote
  Part 1 of a HP/Supernatural crossover series. After an incident with the veil, Harry starts a new life in California. There he finds the Winchester family and a new destiny. H/D. SLASH. COMPLETE. Winner of TWO Always Hoping Fanfiction Awards.
#+end_quote

*HP/Batman:*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5558026/1/No-Fear][No Fear]]

#+begin_quote
  Harry meets the Joker.
#+end_quote

*HP/Tinkerbell*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10914983/1/The-Last-Breath][The Last Breath]]

#+begin_quote
  "When the first baby laughed for the first time, that laugh broke into a thousand pieces and that, was the beginning of fairies." It has been a very long time since that first laugh. It's time for a new beginning. (Slow updates, if any.)

** Well, here are some of my favourites:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8616362/1/Harry-Potter-The-Last-Avatar][Harry Potter and the Last Avatar]]: HP/Avatar

#+begin_quote
  Why is Harry Potter considered the worst firebender in Gryffindor? Why doesn't he want to be noticed? Probably the same reason he dreams of drowning every night. [Harry Potter characters in an AU with magic replaced by the elemental powers of Avatar: The Last Airbender / Legend of Korra. Full summary inside.]
#+end_quote

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5543906/1/Retsu-s-Folly][Retsu's Folly]]: HP/Bleach

#+begin_quote
  It all goes wrong when Dumbledore gives Harry the choice to go back and fight Voldemort or move on. Harry is taken before he can make that choice and is thrown in an unexpected afterlife. Now he is on a mission to fight his way back to his own world.
#+end_quote

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7158052/1/The-Gunslinger-and-the-Mage][The Gunslinger and the Mage]]: HP/Dark Tower

#+begin_quote
  In an abandoned Way Station surrounded by endless desert, Harry Potter awakes, with no memory of his arrival. Alone, sanity fraying, salvation comes from an unexpected source: Roland Deschain, the last gunslinger. A Harry Potter / Dark Tower crossover.
#+end_quote

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9215879/1/The-Prince-That-Was-Promised][The Prince that was Promised]]: HP/Game of Thrones

#+begin_quote
  He remembered being Harry Potter. He dreams of it. He dreams of the Great Other too, a creature borne of ice and death with eyes red as blood and an army of cold, dead things. He is only the 2nd son of the King, a spare, but that changes when things rather left in the dark come to light, and Westeros is torn asunder by treachery and ambition. Winter is coming... but magic is might.
#+end_quote

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10016768/1/Discordant][Discordant]]: HP/Star Wars

#+begin_quote
  It wasn't the bright and shiny Jewel of the Galaxy you've all seen on the HoloNet. Harry's story started in the Underworld, a kilometer below the upper levels of Coruscant, where you never walk the streets alone, especially if you don't have a blaster hanging by your side. He left for a little while, but now it's called him back, whether he realizes it or not.
#+end_quote

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5871255/1/Fictional][Fictional]]: HP/Fate Stay Night

#+begin_quote
  The dictionary defined fiction as thus: something feigned, invented, or imagined; a made-up story. The act of feigning, inventing, or imagining. Yes, Harry thought, this defined him nicely. Harry Potter & Fate/Stay Night Crossover.

Edit: apologies for the Dresden Files links. I only saw this part of your request upon rereading your OP.

** HP X Supernatural

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10536715/1/The-Accidental-Vessel][The Accidental Vessel]] by Alatar Maia

#+begin_quote
  Gabriel might have made a mistake when he borrowed pagan weapons to make a fake angel blade, but he'd thought it would be enough to trick Lucifer. Well, it was, but now the archangel find himself set adrift on another Earth. With his Grace almost gone and unwillingly possessing Harry Potter, what can Gabriel do? Maybe Hogwarts will be enough to distract him. T for swearing.
#+end_quote

I also second the recommendation of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8957424/1/Illusions-of-Grandeur][Illusions of Grandeur]] by Kanathia. It's more of a Supernatural fic than a HP fic, but still very good.

#+begin_quote
  Angels, demons, and Winchesters have made it to the top of Harry's black list, but first impressions are rarely right, and a glass of scotch can soothe anyone's temper. Starts mid season 3 and spans several seasons. Rated T for coarse language and mild violence. Now completed.

HP x LOTR

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8019225/1/Man-in-Fangorn][Man in Fangorn]] by JaidenAye

#+begin_quote
  Stumbling into Fangorn, Merry and Pippin find more magic than Ents and the armies of Middle Earth gain an unexpected ally from the shadows of the woods. That is, if Pippin doesn't insult him into seclusion first. Roughly from challenge by CashyHoray1.00 "Lord of the Forest".

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4838629/1/Not-Quite-A-Maia][Not Quite A Maia]] by Kara's Aunty

#+begin_quote
  Middle Earth has a problem: Gandalf the Grey is AWOL in Time & Space after destroying the Balrog of Khazad-dûm. But who will take his place in the Quest to defeat the Dark Lord Sauron? Not who you think... HP/LOTR Crossover. Wildly AU!

HP x Doctor Who

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7156582/1/That-Which-Holds-The-Image][That Which Holds The Image]] by TheAngelsHaveThePhoneBox

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter faces a boggart that doesn't turn into a Dementor or even Voldermort, but into a horror from his childhood. Now the boggart isn't even a boggart anymore. There's no imitation. That which holds the image of an Angel, becomes itself an Angel.
#+end_quote

Bonus!

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8864415/1/Lifetime][Lifetime]] by robbiepoo2341 is a very good Doctor Who x Supernatural crossover.

#+begin_quote
  (Not shipping) Dean has never met anyone like the Doctor before. For that matter, the Doctor hasn't met anyone like Dean. They keep meeting out of order, too, and that only complicates what is already a rocky relationship. The Doctor isn't human, after all, and he has a tendency to show up when trouble is brewing.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9305868/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Master-s-Ball][Harry Potter and the Master's Ball]] HP/Pokemon. It works, somehow, seriously.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2636980/1/Uzumaki-Harry][Uzumaki Harry]] HP/Naruto. More crack than anything.

** ...I came here to recommend something already on your list and was then distracted by how lovely your list is...

But anyway: [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1134255/chapters/2292768][Whispers in Corners]] is one of my favorite Harry/Sherlock crossovers.

There's also an entire thread of addamsfamily/HP crosovers in the subreddit recently that I won't bother relinking from, but Harveste was one of my favorites from that.

** *HP/Naruto*

- Sneaking around konoha([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/442432]])\\
  Loneliness was not for him, Harry knew that. Then he met Kakashi and he found a solution to his problem.

- Newton's Third Law By: Barrel of Monkeys ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6428527/1/Newton-s-Third-Law]])\\
  How would the Naruto and Harry Potter worlds change if Harry was raised the traditional Hatake way?

*HP/Ironman*

- Stranger in a Familiar land ([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3942424]])\\
  Tony Stark is a complicated guy, with many secrets. One of which is that he is very lonely, despite his money and fame, he has few true friends and no real idea what to do with himself outside of Iron Man. Which is all anyone ever seems to want, except Pepper. Pepper hates Iron Man, but he can't change what he is.\\
  Harry Potter has no idea what the hell is happening and isn't sure that he likes any of it, but he can't go back, can't undo what has been done, ever. A new life, new people, and a new world. None of which he wanted in the first damned place. Apparently what he wants doesn't seem to matter.\\
  The only direction is forward, for both of them. (Tony/Harry)

- The Stark Chronicles by IA29 ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11200075/1/The-Stark-Chronicles]])\\
  Harry discovers about a cousin he never thought he had. The cousin turns out to be none other than Tony Stark. Watch as Tony and Harry find family in each other. No slash. Family fic. Scrambled timeline.

- Petal by worldtravellingfly ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9935403/1/Petal]])\\
  Nine years after the Final Battle, Amaryllis Potter found herself working long shifts in a private hospital in New York City, combining Muggle and magical Healing. The war never really let her go. And then suddenly her quiet, somewhat peaceful life changed abruptly as she ran into a stranger one night, after a long day at work. But not only her life changed... (Tony/Fem!Harry) [AU!]

*HP/Sherlock*

- Patience Rewards Itself By: The Miffed Writer ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10445823/1/Patience-Rewards-Itself]]) Sebastian Moran's job was simple this time; 'fix' Vernon Dursley. He was prepped to do it. He had no problem doing it. That is, until he sees an unidentified boy with no record of existence at the residence thrown out of the home. Thus, Harry Potter gains a (admittedly unconventional) family, Jim gets a protégé and Seb just hopes that Harry won't wind up quite as...off as his Dad

- Ashes to ashes and memories to memories ([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2498459]])\\
  Holmes and Watson have been in 221B Baker Street for quite some time and their lives has settled into a routine, until a beautiful girl walks into their lives. Tristyn Potter is more mysterious than Irene Adler who up till now has captured Sherlock's attention. Tristyn Potter was the godmother of the child she now cares for and the aloof and handsome Sherlock Holmes has caught her attention, but the secrets she hides may just be too much for the detective to handle, but they may also be deadly. (Sherlock/fem!Harry)

- Name confused ([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/441560]])\\
  What if Mycroft's name confused assistant was male? Harry Potter tries to shed his name and his past, taking a rare offer of anonymity while still getting to play the hero. (mycroft/harry)
