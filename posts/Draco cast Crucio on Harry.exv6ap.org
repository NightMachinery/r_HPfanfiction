What would have happened if Draco had cast cruciatus successfully on Harry in the bathroom? How would the events differ?

If Harry gets out alive and intact he would have a legitimate reason to have him arrested and shipped off to Azkaban. Would he?


** Dumbledore would cover that up faster than you can say "Guilty!"

Dumbledore:

- already sent Harry to the Dursleys for over ten years.
- already let Draco slide by almost killing three or four people while plotting to kill him.
- Allowed Marietta Edgecombe to be memory charmed in front of him to cover stuff up.
- Shelved all of Snape's past transgressions (doesn't matter if they were all shown or not), because he became his semi-once in a while-maybe-spy.

He would totally cover it up. He's too hardheaded and set in his ways to let his plan change once he set his mind to it.

** Snape made an unbreakable vow to protect Draco. So Dumbledore would probably cover it up. It's either that or let Snape die. Or let Snape kill Dumbledore much earlier.

*** That's a good point. But to what extent does Snape need to protect him? Also Dumbledore just sweeping it under the rug could cause a major rift with Harry.

After all the casting that curse is a monstrous act.

  to what extend does Snape need to protect him.
#+end_quote

To the best of his ability. Narcissa makes him swear to protect Draco to the "best of his ability."

I don't see any way out of this. If Snape finds out Dumbledore is planning on turning Draco in, he has to act or die. The best of his ability would be to either convince Dumbledore not to do it or kill Dumbledore.

And if Snape doesn't find out, then he finds out when Draco is in Azkaban. And /then/ Snape has to get him out. Or die.

Kind of a clever idea from Rowling. Gives a good excuse for Draco sticking around despite Dumbledore knowing what he's doing. It just makes Snape look stupid for accepting the unbreakable vow.

If Neville and the DA's leaders are dead, the room of requirement isn't being used as their base, and the trio can't get into the castle from aberforth's place.

Basically if Snape dies before at least half of book seven, everything falls apart and Voldemort wins. (In canon anyway)

******** Honestly, the plot is a joke and characters seem to be holding the idiot ball for no reason except that.

Harry wasn't told how to destroy horcruxes at all by Dumbledore. He could've handed the sword over to Harry any time during the year. He could've told him about basilisk venom and made provisions to have the fangs accessible to the Order and the trio.

But, /nooo/. Snape needs to be relevant somehow so he passes on a sword. Ron needs another moment to shine so he can suddenly imitate parseltongue well enough to fool a magical entranceway.

And why the flying fuck would Snape ever make an Unbreakable Vow to protect Malfoy? His position and reputation with Voldemort is secure. The Malfoys' power is on the wane and they're rather irrelevant at that point. Sure, he could've agreed to help without risking his life.

It's hinted at that he's Lucius friend and he genuinely seems to like and approve of Draco (which shows just how much of a hypocrite he is). It's why Narcissa felt comfortable coming to him. In the 1st potions class, Harry says something like "Snape walked around insulting everyone's work, but Draco's" Every Gryffindor, but every student but Draco.

****** And all of that can be blamed on Dumbledore for not giving the trio the necessary tools before he died.

Also, a Basilisk tooth would have done the trick, and Harry can easily get into the chamber. And since Goblins don't count as humans, you can simply use the Imperius on them, just like Harry does at Gringotts anyway. It's not even morally questionable since keeping the Horcrux under their protection is siding with Voldemort, which makes them enemy combatants. And who says that the passage into the ROR wouldn't appear if they need it. Not to mention that with Snape dead, the Order would not have lost their best fighter in that stupid extraction plan.

And just like Harry doesn't have to be the one to kill Voldemort, Neville doesn't have to be the one to kill the snake. Oliver Wood is right there speaking with Neville and both Ron and Hermione are still around. Hell, Harry was just about to move.

Without Snape, some other actual death eater becomes headmaster of hogwarts. And then who's Dumbledore going to talk to? What's stopping them from just torching Dumbledore's portrait? How's Harry going to find out the info he needs? Get the sword? There are ways these things can happen anyway, but it's made even more difficult.

Losing Snape would be a heavy blow against the good side.

By Dumbledore telling him and giving him the sword as he's very much alive for most of HBP because only plot kept him from doing so. There's also the fact that Harry, Ron, and Hermione only remember about basilisk fangs at the end of DH and not the end of HBP. Harry also manages to disregard speaking to Slughorn about Horcruxes in general.

******* No. Harry does not have to die to defeat Voldemort. You can destroy his body, no matter the Horcruxes and then go searching for them. If anything, that would make the search easier. Even assuming that Harry is indeed a Horcrux (which makes no sense given the protection he has), you can reduce Voldemort to a wraith and remove his entire powerbase, effectively preventing his return until Harry dies aged 130 or something like that.

By whom? Voldemort threw away his entire forces in that stupid frontal assault on Hogwarts. By the time he was finished, Bellatrix had been the last one standing before she was killed. Umbridge also apparently was dealt with easily as "all was well" in the epilogue, implying that there was no bloody struggle for control over the ministry.

Execute all surviving Death Eaters or have them kissed by dementors and Voldemort has no powerbase left. Hell, Harry could have planted a few tons of disillusioned explosives (transfiguration, your friend and helper) from under his cloak and ended the conflict during the hour Voldemort gave him to surrender himself. Mechanical detonators and chemical reactions are not impeded by magic after all.

So you would say that all was well in, for example, Poland in 1964? That the 1/5 death toll amongst the population has been completely equalised? That there was no resentment, no trauma, no families torn apart?

Or, a more recent example, do you think that in Syria, 19 years down the road all will be well? That the economy will make a full recovery and a status quo ante bellum can be restored in that time?

Or how about a longer perspective? The US is still divided amongst its civil war battle lines. Or would you really say that all is well there now, nevermind in 1884?

And you can certainly plant enough explosives on the perimeter of the camp to completely blow it up.

"But we prevailed", "Justice was served" or maybe "The wounds healed". You could do a lot better without the three word limit, but here you go.

As for the examples I've given, if you really are too blind to see the parallels between what happened in Poland until 45 and the fact that the Ministry was deporting people of a certain birth under laws which look like a bad copy of the Nürnberg laws, well, I'd recommend picking up a history book.

Syria and the US were just further examples of countries torn apart by civil war. And given that you can see the divide one-and-a-half centuries later, someone claiming all was well, even in a metaphorical way, would have been utterly wrong.
