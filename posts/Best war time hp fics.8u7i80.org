Lf best hp war fics preferably Hogwarts era not 19 years later


** War fics? Hmm:

- Prince of the Dark Kingdom linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom): A minor spoiler but Harry gets kidnapped during the Triwizard Tournament so Voldemort starts a war against several countries in Europe. As a result, Britain becomes an island under seige and includes at least three major battle scenes that I can think of, not to mention the stuff in Ireland (which is trippy to say the least).
- Patron and Divided and Entwined linkffn(Patron; Divided and Entwined): Starfox5 does a good job depicting a sense of war coming to a country, with multiple factions vying for position as top dog and the sorts of atrocities one would expect in such a conflict.
- Skitterleap linkffn(Skitterleap): if you haven't read this, the Austro-Hungarian Empire is at war with a number of other states, particularly in Eastern Europe. Not at Hogwarts, since its a massive AU, but most of the characters are pretty familiar (although its the most unique Fred and George I have ever read).
- The Firebird Trilogy (particularly the last book) linkffn(The Firebird's Son: Book 1 of the Firebird Trilogy): Voldemort, the heads of the covens and Harry's faction are in a bout to take control of magical Britain and decide the future of the witch-born. Good ideas regarding war, though it is pretty dark. Warning: a dark ending indeed.
- Magicks of the Arcane linkffn(Magicks of the Arcane): I have some issues with this fic, but if you think [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8303194/25/Magicks-of-the-Arcane][this]] interests you, give it a full read. A somewhat disappointing ending, but at least it has an ending.
- Harry Potter and the Sword of the Hero linkffn(Harry Potter and the Sword of the Hero): Part of the Hero Trilogy, these fics depict war in truly brutal ways, and have what may be the saddest noble hero arc I can remember.

There are more, but these are the ones that come to mind.

*** I second the firebird trilogy.

So often war is depicted without meaningful losses. Darth Marrs does a great job with this, while some may call it dark, I call it war. War does not leave a winner, merely survivors. Too often the defeat of Voldemort is a great victory followed by rejuvenation and celebration. War inflicts wounds that don't heal, and whether you like the ending, it does an exceptional job of it.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  Fifty years ago, Grindelwald won the duel that shaped the world. In a land overwhelmed by darkness, a hero emerges: a young wizard with the power, influence and opportunity to restore the light. Harry Potter, caught up in a deadly game of cat and mouse, must decide what he truly believes. Does this world deserve redemption? Or, more importantly, does he?

  Sometimes, all it takes to rise to greatness is a helping hand, the incentive to survive. And thrust between giants Harry has no choice but become one himself if he wants to keep on breathing. He might've found a way, but life's never that easy. Clock's ticking, Harry. Learn fast now.
