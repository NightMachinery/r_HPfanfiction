Searching for some good Harry Potter fanfictions in which Harry is an introvert. Also fine if he is dark and mysterious and comes off as desirable to witches. He likes to be alone after his first 11 years living in Dursley household.


** Honestly, Canon!Harry is a natural introvert. He has a small social circle and shuns overt socialization.

Lomonaaeren has some good fics in this direction: Linkao3(Forget-Me-Not by Lomonaaeren; The Art Of Self-Fashioning)

Hmm, what else..? It would be easier to list fics where he /isnt/ an introvert than not. Linkao3(Blood Crest by Cauchy) is another good rec.

  Harry isn't the Boy-Who-Lived, but his parents still died, and Albus Dumbledore, concerned that Death Eaters might seek the boy's death, cast a powerful charm on him to make wizards ignore him before Harry was left with the Dursleys. Except, with the Elder Wand in play, the charm was far too powerful, and made others essentially forget Harry existed when not directly interacting with him. Sorted into Ravenclaw at Hogwarts, Harry lives a contented life with no one either loving or hating him...until the charm breaks on his seventeenth birthday, and he's suddenly plunged directly into the middle of a living world at war.

  In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. But while Harry deliberately hides his growing skills, Minerva worries more and more about the mysterious, brilliant student writing to her who may be venturing into dangerous magical territory.
