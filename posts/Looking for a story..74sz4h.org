I can't remember the title, but basically it was one of those 'wrong boy who lived' ones.

Basically Harry's brother won, parents still alive, Harry joined Voldemort, broke out of Azkaban, breaks into the Potter home before dropping dead on front of good brother.

There was a specific moment where he taps his brother on the head with his index and middle fingers.

Anybody able to help a brotha out?
