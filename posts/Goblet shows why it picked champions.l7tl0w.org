In this fic goblet showed why it picked each champion, fleur lived thru the fight with mere people, Victor was something i think about wronski feint and how he broke his nose, cedric was how he saved some classmates from basilisk, and it showed harry in the chamber of secrets


** The abandoned fic The Goblet's Surprise by furyvore shows why it picked each champion.

#+begin_quote
  As part of the Triwizard Tournament, the Goblet of Fire may re-ignite after choosing the champions. This is a rare part of the choosing ceremony during which the goblet justifies its choices by showing something about each champion that influenced its decision.

** It'd be really funny if it showed some exemplary actions for Fleur, Cedric and Krum, then just showed Moody confunding it when Harry's name came out.
