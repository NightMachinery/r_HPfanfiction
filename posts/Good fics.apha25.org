Different subcommunities have different tastes that shift over time. There's also a ~monthly book club in the sidebar, so you can check out some past fics there.

**** For sure. And even here there are highly rated fics that I personally didn't enjoy (i.e. Emperor), fics I enjoyed when I read them years ago but didn't enjoy recently/on a second reading/have arguably aged poorly (i.e. Black Comedy), and easily more than a dozen other fics on that list that I tried and didn't enjoy. So I was just making it clear that I wasn't /personally/ endorsing every fic on the list, even though it's a good start.

** Harry/Daphne is one of my favourite pairings. Have you read the fics by this author? [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/8431550/Dorothea-Greengrass]] There's also this community of fics [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Completed-Harry-and-Daphne-Fanfiction/126530/99/0/1/0/0/0/0/]] with completed works in this pairing.

Linkffn(Unatoned) is a personal favourite, but very different from standard Harry/Daphne fics. Linkffn(The Legacy Preservation Act) is an interesting spin on the marriage law/contract trope. Linkffn(Contractual Invalidation) is a post war fic that's more lighthearted. Linkffn(Days to come) Linkffn(Beltane Child) are also in the post war genre, but those last three aren't really action stories.

More in the fighting the war story with Haphne is linkffn(Honour thy blood).

For Harry/Bellatrix I'd suggest Linkffn(Delenda Est) but you most likely have already read it since it's highly acclaimed.

#+end_quote

you didn't list it, and it's a kinda new... and feels like a good fic, so I thought I could link it; [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13133746/1/Daphne-Greengrass-and-the-Importance-of-Intent][Daphne Greengrass and the Importance of Intent]] which is from Daphne PoV.

another one which is also Daphne/Harry is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13022013/1/Novocaine][Novocaine]] in which Harry finds out he is loaded (got all death eater money) and needs help investing it all into rebuilding Diagon Alley... Daphne is the lawyer he finds & employs.

** If you like HP/DG fics, then I have to recommend Daphne Greengrass and the Importance of Intent - linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13133746/20/Daphne-Greengrass-and-the-Importance-of-Intent][13133746]])

** In terms of HP/DG my two current favourites are linkffn(The Mind Arts by Wu Gang) and linkffn(Black Luminary by YakAge), though neither pairing is really /confirmed/, and the latter especially is totally up in the air (however Daphne is my current favourite of the options).

In terms of just general good fics, I've just finished linkffn(Phoenix Corrupted by iamneverwhere), which has a really unique concept and deserves more love. Hopefully it's not totally abandoned, though I'm not sure it fits your criteria anyway.

  The war against the Dark Lord was the last straw. The oppressed, fed up with oligarchy, corruption, and injustice, sharpened their knives, rallying behind those who promised change. They won. Today, Magical Britain is a changed country -- for the better. Hail and praise to our saviours! Finally, all is well. But listen! Can't you hear the grindstone turning still ...?

  A chance meeting and Albus and Gellert would become inseparable friends, until the death of Albus' sister. But what if Ariana had survived? Almost a century later, a boy named Harry Potter would survive the Killing Curse, finally bringing an end to Grindelwald's war. Now, as he finds a place for himself at Hogwarts, there are signs that suggest that the war might not truly be over.

** linkffn(The Arithmancer) if you're interested in Hermione inventing interesting spells.

linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7) is one of my all time favorites, Sirius is very caring for Harry and Tonks working with Remus is interesting.

linkffn(The Green Girl) is another fic I really appreciated. Good plot twists and a interesting dark side.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Deus Ex Machina) has the most awesome Regulus Black I've even seen.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Rune Stone Path)

linkffn(The Very Best by BrilliantLady)

linkffn(Raptor by sakurademonalchemist)

linkffn(Hermione Granger, Demonologist)

linkffn(The many Deaths of Harry Potter)
