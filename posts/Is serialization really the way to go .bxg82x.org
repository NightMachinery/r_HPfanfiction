** There isn't a right or wrong but I suspect that a very large proportion of fics that are written and posted chapter by chapter are never finished. Personally, I've always completed fics before posting, then posted chapters twice a week until it was complete. And I have been in the position of starting a fic at a time when there would probably have been plenty of interest but by the time I'd finished it, the whole thing around which it was based was pretty well toxic (Cursed Child if you couldn't guess), and it didn't get a single review for several chapters.

Also, it's difficult to get meaningful and useful constructive feedback on fanfiction. You'll probably need to play review games or do exchanges. It's very rare to get unsolicited critique and there are better places to go for critique on your work.

However, I have to add that my fics are obscure to say the least. My strategy didn't get me any success, and fanfiction generally has made me pretty miserable, so I am probably the last person you should listen to. But oh god I wish someone had told me all this before I ever started. Sad to say, if I could turn the clock back, I wouldn't have done it at all.

*** As with anything, 90% of reviews are shite (when it comes to constructive feedback). Don't get me wrong, it is always nice to read that your work is appreciated, but a "nice chapter, can't wait to read the next one" doesn't really tell you how you can improve your writing. YET, the other 10% are useful, and those are the reviews you really want.

Perhaps it's a new angle will make you rethink a scene due to some unintended implication. Maybe someone predicts the way your story will end and you'll change your outline (to make it happen or to make sure nothing like that happens).

And of course there's always that one guy who reviews "awaiting more" Under what feels like every chapter on FFN.

** You sound like a someone who's a perfectionist, and doesn't understand why others are not.

Fanfiction isn't he world of published books. You can't go to a publisher with half an idea. You can do that with fanfiction on the internet.

Posting chapters as you write is a form of motivation for many people. They want to know that the weird thing that they thought of isn't that weird after all. If they tried writing the whole story in one go, they'll abandon it, just like many authors abandon half-finished stories on fanfiction sites.

The difference is that now that half-finished story is available for others to read. Maybe it'll light a spark in someone else's mind, and they'll write about that derivative work.

I think the world would be much, much better place if all the unfinished stories that aspiring authors abandoned were available for us to read.

*** I was speaking on the ground of trying to produce the highest quality product. I'l be honest, I'm probably not going to publish anything I wrote because I don't think it's qualitative enough. Let's be honest two second here, fanfiction is very not that good writing in general and I think readers could benefit it if the writers were being a little more exigeant with their works, being self-aware is not a bad thing.

**** I know I'm an asshole for bringing this up, but it is hilarious to me that you're talking about being self-aware about the quality of your writing while using the word "exigeant," and /misusing/ the word "qualitative."

** So, let me preface this by saying I'm actually planning to finish or at least mostly finish and completely plan my current WIP before I start posting it.

/However,/ serialization has its own benefits. What I think you're missing primarily is that most fic authors don't use feedback as a means to improve, they use it /for motivation/. Writing in a vacuum can be disheartening for a lot of people. They start to have doubts about the quality and value of their writing, or even just get distracted by something else. But if you've got people commenting how great your stuff is every time you post a chapter, or even just leaving some kudos, you have the assurance that you're on the right track and at least /someone/ out there appreciates your work.

Also I'm not sure what the problem is with a difference in quality if that difference is the writing getting /better/. If somebody gets through the first few rough chapters of your fic, they're only going to appreciate the improvement. And a lot of authors who are dissatisfied with the quality of their earlier chapters just post a new revised version of the story after they edit it all.

I'm of the school of thought that even if you're posting a WIP you can always go back and edit stuff in. It's one of the risks we take by /reading/ WIPs.

And honestly, it's not really an issue in a lot of genres. Your average slice-of-life coffeeshop AU isn't at a big risk of needing serious editing. I mean, God knows I thought Charles Dickens and Alexandre Dumas could have stood to have some fat trimmed off of their writing sometimes, but if the point is to enjoy the ride, then it's not something you really need to worry about. For a lot of people, the purpose of writing fanfiction isn't necessarily to create a quality product, it's to /have fun/ and connect with other fans along the way.

Besides, there are plenty of people who finish writing before they post. It's not exactly a revolutionary idea. I just think the cost/benefit analysis people consider before posting longer works mostly comes out in favor of serialization. What's wrong with instant gratification, anyway?

Motivation works I guess. I hadn't taken that into account.

I guess you could say it better having your latter chapters of better quality than your earlier ones, but wouldn't it be better if all the chapters were of the same quality as the latter ones ? I would assume prewritting a fic and doing a final editing/rewriting of all the text at once would produce a final product of quality on the level you stand as an writer at the time of publishing.

Even if it's possible to rewrite earlier chapters I wouldn't like to do that, it seems like a bad habit to have (peoples can miss the changes or get confused. If the changes is major, then you're basically forcing the reader to re-read a chapter they already completed because of a mistake on your part).

Of course, but the subject was obviously on the ground of trying to produce the highest quality story possible.

I didn't say anything is wrong with instant gratification, I just said it was the only reason I could think of for serialization.

** If you have the time to prewrite and the dedication to do it, then it's a great option for all the reasons you cite.

​

I personally am terrible at completing things; if I waited until I finished a story to start posting, I'd never post.

I've been writing and not-finishing stories for as long as I can remember. Only with the pressure of a potential audience - however small - was I able to start, carry through for two years, and finally complete a fic.

Only the knowledge that chapters 1-12 are posted out there is strong enough to push me into writing chapter 13. Otherwise, I'd be skipping merrily off after whatever new plot popped into my head that week.

I started writing my first (very bad) fic in 2016, started posting within a week. I finished it two years later.

There were multiple times over the course of those two years where I wanted nothing so much as to give up, drop the horrible story, and never think about it again. But I finished, because I knew that otherwise it would be abandoned. And I've come across enough stories where the writers said 'I just don't feel like writing more,' and dropped them - and I won't be that person.

​

Am I the same writer now as when I started my stories? Absolutely not. My writing is different, I'm different, my characters are constantly tweaked as I get new ideas. Will it be a seamless story? No. Could it do with editing, foreshadowing, tightening? Certainly.

But I've fought too hard for too long against the inclination to rework, overwork, and perfect everything before I move on, and frankly I'd rather write a complete story that's a bit disjointed than a very good chapter one to a story that's never finished. Editing can always come later.

​

So, yes. If writing the whole thing works for you, absolutely go for it. But if anyone reading this needs that external push to keep going - whether readers, reviews, or just the knowledge that your unfinished story is out there in the world - don't feel bad about it.

There is no wrong way to write as long as you don't give up and do your best to keep improving along the way.

** You enjoy your hobby the way you want to, and I'll enjoy mine the way I want to.

Though, having someone about to post their first fic smugly informing the world in a tedious essay that their way is the best way is kind of funny to me. Humility not your strong suit, I'm guessing.

*** Yeah of course you write however you want, I was just trying to make an argument about a method of writing that seems to hold multiples advantages to me. Sorry if you found my post to be condescending or something, please feel free to explain what you find appealing with serialization.
