[Was looking through my notes and found this from a while ago]

*He didn't mean to say yes.*

*Purely by accident, Harry accepts a reward from a pair of grateful, miffed and incredibly petty alchemists at the end of his first year.*

Harry awakens in the Hospital Wing and catches the tail end of an argument between Dumbledore and the Flamel's. The former claiming he had no choice to destroy the Philosopher's Stone and the latter couple furious he did such a thing without their consent. However, Harry discovers the Stone is still in his pocket and becomes somewhat suspicious and curious as to why Dumbledore would claim such a thing (later hearing it was because Voldemort would surely come for it again).

Noticing he's awake, the Flamel's take to personally thanking Harry for, though it was apparently in vain, defending their precious Stone. Both seeming lovely, Harry is upset at learning they really would die without it.

Thus Harry (to Dumbledore's horror, as he tries to shuffle his old teachers/friends out) hands over the Philosopher's Stone to Nicholas and Pernelle.

Immediately they shower him in praise and gratitude for his honourable and honest action; the Flamel's state they will give him anything he wants as a reward.

Baffled, and a bit intimidated, Harry is silent but Pernelle comes up with the perfect idea and offers him a place at their old school:

/Beauxbaton's/

The two go on about the beauty of the chateau and the grounds, the top tier education, the schools of magic taught there (that Hogwarts doesn't cover) and the incredible honour it would be to attend. They also let him know that they will pay for his entire schooling as a thank you and excitably push for an answer. Harry, incredibly intimidated, agrees despite himself and the Flamel's are off to make arrangements before anyone can stop them... a pale Dumbledore trying to laugh it off as he tells Harry he will "take care of it."

Days later, the Flamel's and a woman rivaling Hagrid in size await him at Platform 9 & ¾. The woman introducing herself as Beauxbaton's Headmistress and wonder if he has time to have a tour of the grounds in the next few days. So he can see the teachers before they leave for the summer AND see the grounds without students interrupting them.

Harry is later shown the grounds and Madame Maxime introduces him to a few of the staff and straggling older students. He is emnamoured immediately by the location but feels somewhat guilty as Hogwarts was his first home.

The Flamel's are able to wheedle out of him that he was mistreated by the Dursley's, but the Flamel's claim they have more than enough push with the Ministry's of Britain and France to ensure that, no, he does not have to return EVER AGAIN. They claim they don't want Harry to feel pressured to attend Beauxbaton's at all and that he should make his own decision.

When Harry fails to receive any letters over the summer, upset, he decides he would very much like to go to Beauxbaton's instead. He sends a letter of acceptance to Maxime and the Flamel's, leading him to be whisked away from his room in the Leaky Cauldron that next day...


** How would they name the books after that?

- Harry Potter and the Chamber of Wine
- Harry Potter and the normal year
- Harry Potter and the Dismissed Contract
- Harry Potter and the Order of the Baguette
- Harry Potter and the Liar's Funeral
- Harry Potter and the... I got nothing.

*** Not really what I had in mind. Reading through my notes on the story it was more:

A) Dumbledore wanted the Stone destroyed so Voldemort could never use it. I believe I had Tom going after it again later in tue story and actually getting it.

B) The safest place for Harry to be is where he can see him. In this story, despite his position in the ICW, the bulk of Dumbledore's influence doesn't reach past Britain. Meaning it would be harder to keep him safe if he went to Beauxbatons (which is definitely something I explored later on)

And thanks for the heads up, I wasn't sure about the apostrophe

**** To add to the apostrophe thing, it is NEVER acceptable to pluralize words with an apostrophe-s. You should just throw an s on the and be done with it, unless the word ends with a y preceded by a consonant, such as liberty -> liberties.

This holds true for family names (Potters, Malfoys, Lovegoods) and place names. If you say the Flamel's, you are saying the thing owned by the Flamel. The Flamels would be the people who go by that name. The Flamels' would show ownership by not just one Flamel, but a whole group of them.

The only time you should do apostrophe-s for pluralization is for a single letter. So only apostrophe-s for you s's.

** This sounds really good and thought out. I like it. One of your commentators mentioned Dumbledore bashing, I'd read it either way.

I'm laughing at myself though, and it might make you laugh too so I'll share. Most of the time when I read a description, I think how I'd write it, whether I've any plans to write anything or not. With this my first thought was about Snape's promise to keep Harry safe.

I'm picturing him going to Beauxbatons and interviewing for a job, Madame Maxine's doubt or disbelief and what he'd have to say/do to convince her. Another thought is the awkwardness Harry would feel when he realized his most hated professor followed him.

If Snape managed to nab a teaching job, instead of just brewing for the school or something, we might see a personality shift since he doesn't have to worry about Death Eater children and Beauxbatons wouldn't put up with the overly harsh persona/personality.

Last but possibly my favorite, his response to the Death Eaters when they confront him and especially in 4th year when Voldemort returns. I prefer long stories so having a sub story in with the main story isn't a problem for me and as Snape is my favorite character there's always room in a story for him for me. But I could see it being a huge turn off for some others.

*** I really like this idea, and ironically the story revolves around Harry deciding to beat Snape's record for being the youngest Potions Master when, under his new Potions Professor, he finds he is actually quite talented and really enjoys the class.

And, though I didn't plan on having Snape teach there, I did have a funny idea that Tom decided to see if he could get a job at Beauxbatons so he could better monitor and assess Harry's strength but the only one available was the only job he was entirely unqualified to teach: Muggle Studies.

**** I may or may not have squealed that someone like my ideas.

Tom teach muggle studies or send Snape to teach it? Either way they were both raised in muggle areas and perhaps just need a refresher of the past decade (in Snape's case) or so and it would be hilarious.

As a potion's master I see Snape being qualified to teach herbology and perhaps care of magical creatures due to the need for gathering ingredients. I've a lot of notes on why he'd be good for other classes as well, reasons why they are a part of a mastery or interested in general. If you want them I could direct message you or something.

As this is a different school you could also make different options for classes as well. I read a story once where Snape (in an alternate universe) was an expert on magical devices - Tom could be interested in something like that.

Pity the Flamels didn't go to Durmstrang. Have Snape or Riddle challenge the current Dark Arts prof to a duel and a knowledge test or dark arts maze. Winner gets the teaching position. I like the thought of Snape wanting to be a teacher so he can dissuade students from being a Death Eater. Hmmm, I just have myself a new plot bunny I don't have time for. Nothing to do with the Flamels, just Snape challenging Durmstrang DA or DADA professors.

** This idea sounds /really/ good! I've been looking to write an HP fic for a while, and I'd like to try my hand at this one. I do see some problems, though.

I'm a fairly average writer, so I feel like I would butcher certain aspects of the story.

I'll likely still try my hand at it, maybe with a few changes here and there, but I'm no /jbern/ or /Less Wrong/ so if any of you do end up reading it, which I would love, I'd ask for your /constructive/ criticism and that you don't expect too much from the get-go.

​

OP, would you want me to credit you?

I put prompts up for people to use, as I don't have the time to do these myself for the most part.

Though I've got to ask you, if I do end up doing my own version of this fic, would you mind? I'll DEFINITELY be reading yours as I would love to see your ideas with the premise.

**** The more, the merrier!

I'll most definitely give you credit, and I would /love/ to see your version if you do one! There are certain aspects of the plot I could see myself changing and certain aspects that I'm sure would be different between ours.

As of right now, I'm trying to mentally structure the story, and I could easily see some things like the Flamels teaching Harry, Harry/Fleur- stuff like that. I'm slightly nervous, I'd rather not disappoint lol
