I had asked this before, but didn't get too many suggestions.

Not because they want too, but because they know that the Death Eaters won't stop what they're doing.

Bonus if Harry kills and has to live with what he did.

Note: No Super powerful Harry, or super smart Harry, Harry more powerful or smarter then he was in canon is fine, but make it believable.

Only have them kill when they have too, again not because they want too. The morality being questioned and the like, is also welcomed.

No Harem Harry

No Seer Luna

No Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash

Would rather it be completed, but if not it's fine

No Weasley bashing, as I really love that family

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.
