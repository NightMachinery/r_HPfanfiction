So I was reading (yet another) fanfiction where they use the " Snape is forced to be mean and bully students and especially Harry because of his job as a spy. "

And i think that's pretty stupid, I mean during the whole years where Voldemort disappeared, Snape had to "convince" Dumbledore he was a redeemed deatheater. Wouldn't it be more logic to get his temper and hatred a little bit in check ? Surely it wouldn't be convincing if he started bullying Gryffindors AND the boy who lived under Dumbledore's nose.

And the fact that he almost got away with everything proves that Dumbledore really trusted him right ? Because yes as much I don't fully agree with some of Dumbledore's acts nor do I particularly like him as a character, I admit that he was one of the strongest and most intelligent wizards in the HP universe. And that he feigned ignorance sometimes when it suited him, but he wouldn't put so much trust in Snape AND let him behave this way if he didn't have some reassurances. So in Snape's situation (from Voldemort's perspective at least) he had to put in some effort to keep his position as Dumbledore's spy right ?

I think most of Snape's acts were a result of his own hatred and grudges. I get that some people want to look for convincing excuses but I just don't understand this one..


** Are there any fics that deliver on this Snape-is-a-spy thing? Like delivering actionable intelligence, providing information and data on persons of interest? Because from what I recall this is usually glossed over and not explored at all.

** For some reason, I sometimes get the feeling alot of people who try to make Snape into a less despicable arse than he is have only seen the films.

Film Snape and book Snape are two entirely different people.

Some people maintain that Snape is well regarded and respected by his peers, but I completely disagree with that. His knowledge, skill and talent are respected, but Snape /the person/ is tolerated, and just barely, at that.

** Snapes abused the fact that Dumbledore valued him as a spy because even if Dumbledore had been wrong about Tom's survival Snape would have still had an in with the death eater and could feed information to dumbledore

His actions towards both Harry and towards the student body in general are just him lashing out at people who have no way to really fight back as dumbledore isn't going to rein him in unless he crosses a line, though where that line is up in the air per dumbledores actions in HBP

** Snape apologists who can't tolerate flawed characters... I prefer stories to not simplify troubled and complex characters. Yes, Snape was blind to Harry, all he could see was a reflection of James and he acted on that assumption and /this is fine/. Snape doesn't need to be a Saint in order to be interesting. People who try to excuse his behavior just want a perfect martyr to admire. Like, reread canon folks, even assuming Unreliable Narrator, Snape is still deeply unfavorable.

** I definitely agree with that, that Snape acted as he did and got to keep his job as a teacher (with Dumbledore /constantly/ claiming he trusted Snape) makes it obvious he wasn't at Hogwarts to teach. (Even Insane Voldemort™ should have realized that.)

If he were to be believable as a spy, I think he should have been a competent teacher, at the very least (and he definitely wasn't). So, I actually think he was incompetent as a teacher /and/ as a spy. Not very cunning at all (but then, Slytherins in general weren't shown to be).

Other thing I believe: his attitude enabled bullying and strenghtened blood supremacist beliefs among the students, specially the Slytherins.

** I would have given Snape's treatment of Harry a pass if, /and only if/ it was an isolated case. You can make a reasonable argument in such a case that Snape engineered an animosity towards Harry to avoid being put in a difficult spot once Voldemort is back: if Harry trusts Snape implicitly, why can't Snape abduct Harry and bring him to Voldemort? After all, in Voldemort's mind, Harry's continued survival is the only thorn against domination of Wizarding Britain.

However, Snape's treatment of Harry is /not/ an isolated case. He treats other Gryffindors badly as well, and Neville arguably even worse than Harry. There is no good justification for this at all.

** I mean, we /know/ why Snape behaved the way he behaved: He simply was a dick. Dumbledore says so (in nicer words), there's nothing more to it. So your answer is that someone people don't like that, and feel like they have to come up with a "better" reason, that makes Snape look "better". And that the logic is flimsy to nonexistent has not ever stopped any trope from being popular (Potters dumping WBWL at the Dursleys, Betrothal Contracts existing for no reason, ...)

 

I'd probably focus more on Snape's behaviour in the first place. Was it so bad that it needs excuses? For many modern-day (likely non-UK) readers, apparently, or we wouldn't have those stories, but in the context of (elite) boarding schools and by historic standards, a teacher like Snape is somewhat par for the course.

The idea that children simply were brats that needed to be taught lessons and disciplined in order to make them actual people (i.e. grown-ups) is only like 20 years out of date, at the very least in the '90s. Hence, people like Snape but also Filch or Headmaster Phineas are stock characters that appear in basically any classical boarding school novel. Knowing this context relativises Snape's behaviour, and also the reaction it gets (a frown, and otherwise the advice to suck it up). And hence, it's perfectly possible to have an otherwise quite genial person acting like Snape in a classroom.

Oooh I never really thought of it from this point of view. That's also very true. Appart from his Harry bullying that we know is because of James, and Neville bullying that I suppose is because he kind of dislikes him too (I mean he was the other child in the prophecy so he could have been chosen instead of Lily's son), I never really thought of Snape as the average teacher in those times. I get that in the like last 20 years, there was a lot of progress but yes its true that like in the past teachers were a lot more meaner and some outright abusive..

But there's no denying the entire approach to teaching was revamped from like the '70s onward; teachers started treating children as equals, and that, while not preventing arseholes from being teachers, made treating them like Snape does impractical.

The foundation of this classroom approach is that you accept children as lesser beings. If you don't, behaviour like Snape's raises questions.

**** If Snape wasn't a spy but was reformed, he would have a lot of difficulty maintaining his position as a teacher with how he acts, but because he's a spy, Dumbledore has no problem with him being a bit Death-Eatery. Because he's a double agent (both sides think he's playing the other side) this is especially true because he can basically act however he wants and justify it as trying to be more convincing to the other side. In the case we're talking about here, he acts like a jerk towards Harry and as a double agent he can justify it to Dumbledore as a way of shifting suspicion away from his attachment to Lily. For Voldemort / Malfoy he can justify it as his real feelings and say that Dumbledore thinks he's acting, or just lets him get away with it. Snape doesn't NEED his status as a spy as motive for being a total jerk, but it is certainly a way in which depth can be added to the character beyond just Snape bashing.

Hmmm yes, I was mostly seeing it from the death eater perspective.. It's true that at the end of the day Snape was in both sides (even if his true allegiance was the order's) he acted of behalf of both in multiple occasions

****** Yeah exactly, Snape might have been on the side of the Order, but he was still a powerful dark wizard with serious anger issues. There's a very real chance he deliberately took advantage of Dumbledore's trust and his status as a double agent to take out his anger on students with impunity.

** Because Dumbledore and Snape have been on the same page the whole time? Dumbledore and Snape both knew the Dark Lord was coming back, so Snape had to come across like a death eater at least to some extent. Honestly I think him being consistently a bad guy or consistently a good guy is better than the books regardless of which side you drop him off on. That being said I do think the fact that Snape was toned down for the movies is indicative that once JKR decided he was a good guy she realized she made him way to evil.
