Hey guys, as the title says, I'm looking for fics where the protagonist (Harry or any female character) is far more powerful physically than the others, and there is a heavy emphasis on this fact in the fic. (Maybe have him/her be half-giant? )


** linkffn(Enter the Dragon by dogheadthirteen) - Harry becomes a dragon... and stays that way.

  It began with a quirk of timing. It continued because dragons, such as what 8-year-old Harry Potter just turned into, are large and difficult to control. Fortunate for everyone he's a nice kid, eh? Shadowrun and Rifts crossover. You have now been warned.
