Like he • got back in time • got a gift to fight with or help in other areas • took the place of the leader of the three • is the reason a certain event didn't happen as worse as it did in canon like he prevented Pettigrew from escaping or killed or at least distracted Bellatrix before she could kill Sirius • his good traits are more shown and through a nice action towards someone of the Slytherin he gained an ally that's gonna save them a few times and helps to bring more Slytherin to the light side

#+begin_quote
  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Mary Sues, no Character bashing.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

#+begin_quote
  Ronald Weasley follows in his father's footsteps, pushing the envelope of magical application to muggle science. As the forerunner of his new magical art, Ron is forced to make a universe-altering choice-one that spits in the face of magic, science, and logic. With a magic-generated Tipler cylinder and a dash of exotic matter, the world's first Technomancer travels back in time.
