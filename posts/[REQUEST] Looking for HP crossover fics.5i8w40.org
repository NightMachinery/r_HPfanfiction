Hi everyone! It's my first time posting here so I hope I did the flair right. I'm looking for fics where Harry (whether accidentally or intentionally) crosses over to another fandom universe. That is, not fics where it's still the HP universe but some things are different, and not fics where two fandoms exist side by side (for example, Harry is adopted by Sherlock and John but still goes to Hogwarts). A good example of what I'm looking for is esama's [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1134255/chapters/2292768][whispers in corners]]. I'm only interested in well-written fics, and ones that are either completed or have been unpdated recently. I really don't mind which fandom the crossover is with, I'll read anything.

Thanks for your help!


** The Difference One Man can make is an incredibly enjoyable crossover with Game of Thrones that requires very little knowledge of GoT to enjoy; i went into it with no knowledge of the series and enjoyed it so much I decided to start reading the books! It has city-building aspects, rune-usage, and some politics.

I will say the first chapter is really set-up heavy, and honestly feels like a clunky way of buffing Harry going into the crossover, but it's a fun read otherwise.

**** Also check out "The Last Lion of House Reyne" from the same author. It plays before Robert's Rebellion and has Harry interact with characters that are dead in canon. Mainly Arthur and Ashara Dayne but also Rhaegar (not much yet but i'm fairly sure we'll see more of him in the future.)

He also doesn't immediately remember his last life and therefore all his magic. Makes it a lot more interesting imo.

***** I've only read the first chapter by now (work :/) but so far I'm not impressed. You did say the first chapter wasn't as good as the rest though so I'll continue reading. I'll check out her/his other stuff if it gets better. Thanks again!

** A few other good crossover fics where Harry completely leaves his own universe behind are 'Who am I?' , which has Harry in the Eragon universe due to unusual means, Wand and Shield has Harry entering the MCU as a Master of Death doing all sorts of pleasantly fun super-powery things, and Double Jeopardy is another fun Eragon crossover that has Harry leaving his own universe behind.

I could probably root out some more given time but these were in my favorites and easy to get to. Some of the writing is of course tropey, but all of them are at least lengthy, enjoyable in concept, and updated in the last year or so, barring Double Jeopardy which updated a little longer ago than that.

  Eager for more power, Galbatorix tried to create the first dragon Shade. The spirit he'd summoned, the Master of Death, took pity on the poor dragon and merged their souls rather than simply taking control of the body. Now with a mind to match his rage, the new Shruikan plans to dish out justice while he searches for his new Name. [On indefinite hiatus: Plz see Ch 28 for details]

  Having a deranged dark wizard after you is not too great. Having something you cannot quite explain after you in a strange world where the kindest fate is to find yourself on the wrong end of a sword makes that first thing seem like child's play. Geralt/Yennefer, Harry/? Rated M. Because there's no other way to write a Witcher story.

  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.
