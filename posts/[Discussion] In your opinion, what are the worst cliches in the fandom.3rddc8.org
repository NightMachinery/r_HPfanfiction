** Lord Potter-Gryffindor-Slytherin-Ravenclaw-Black-Dumbledore-Peverell-Evans-Bones-Greengrass-Parkinson-Weasley, half the titles claimed by right of conquest the others by betrothals. He also has controlling interest in every magical business and has a majority of seats on the Wizengamot, or he will so long as his best friend Lord Longbottom-Abbott-Lovegood also votes with him.

He's also a magical, political, and economic prodigy at age 14 with established alliances with all magical races.

** Bonds. Especially unintentional bonds, of all kinds.

One could be lead to think that self-control or even basic survival instinct don't exist in the realm of Harry Potter. Bonds popping up because divine figure number 3 said so, or because character Y did this, or because character Z made this mistake.

That potential topic for debate aside, fics with bonds of any type have a tendency to also use the term "magical cores". I have yet to read a decent implementation of said cores or mechanics behind the various potential aspects of having one.

I would also add overpowered and nerd!harry to this as well as magical portraits of old people, the Elder Wand, and completely not noticing Veela allure, or having Veela allure affect everyone but Harry.

**** I don't think it's too hard to dodge most fics that involve that list. The summary alone is usually an indication of quality. The bashing part might be the hardest thing to dodge, since most stories have /some/ bashing since authors are generally predisposed to disliking their least favorite characters, so the writing will be slanted towards that

Also, the no STD thing is weird, since I'm skeptical at how common STD's would be in private high-school setting. It's not like they just appear from nowhere, so it would have to be something like Hermione boning her older muggle neighbor who has one, and then transmiting it to the school because she's a slut. I tend to avoid fics where everyone is boning everyone, so I don't really see it as an issue that needs to be covered in gen fics at all.

There are harder trops to dodge, such as friendly!goblins, magical cores, Hadrian Potter, multi-compartment trunks, and evil!Slytherins.

**** He's one of the bravest kids of his year, willing to sacrifice himself in their first year. He followed Harry down into the Chamber of Secrets with a broken wand. He also stood up (with a broken leg too) to who he thought was a mass-murderer in their third year. His problem is that, like with so many other characters, his characterization was wrecked several times for plot reasons, to the point of him becoming a joke.

********* Well, then, you're missing out on some of the best-written fanfic in the fandom - if not THE best-written. It's really professional-grade stuff. But I see what you mean about reading fic primarily for Hermione; I guess a good way to approach /Alexandra Quick/ is to think of it as an original-fic series in the same universe, and not as fanfic per se.

But the reason I mention it is that it's very, very character-driven. Nobody gets the idiot ball just to drive the plot forward, and there's no derailment. (Yet.)

****** And quite a lot of his issues can be attributed to jealousy and the desire to actually have anything of his own. A petty reason, sure, but there are signs that point to him actually being his family's unfavourite child (signs that he might actually be noticing and taking for what they seem to be), so though I do get annoyed at him for once again throwing a fit because of jealousy, I sort of can understand the “why” of it.

And most of the problem with him in both book 4 and book 7 have their root in jealousy as the motive. So a prat he still is, but not to the degree that the people bashing him make him out to be.

****** Wait, so Ron being willing to sacrifice himself to Sirius (who they thought was a mass murderer) in order to protect Harry is merely idiocy? Ron being terrified of spiders, but being willing to go into the Forbidden Forest in order to try and establish a friend's innocence is idiocy? Ron's willing sacrifice on the chess board, aimed towards stopping what he thought was the return of Voldemort, is idiocy?

Maybe those examples are idiocy to some people, but to each their own. To me, they're brave acts by a guy who struggles constantly with his own insecurities-- and maybe some people will scoff and say that folks should get over insecurities, but that's not how it works. You struggle with them, deal with them, and try to make the best choices you can, all while feeling like you're not measuring up to the person you think you can be. Ron is the kind of character who has to deal with that his entire life, and I think he comes out on top.

It also helps explain how someone can be magically exhausted, since their core is depleted.
