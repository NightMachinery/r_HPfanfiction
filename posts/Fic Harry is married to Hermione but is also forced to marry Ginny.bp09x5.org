I'm looking for a specific story where Harry and Hermione are married but due to a contract he also has to marry Ginny. Hermione becomes the main wife and Ginny ends up cheating on Harry. If anyone could help I'd appreciate it so much!


** Alright, for this post you want the “What's that Fic?” flair.

The flairs in this subreddit are used to differentiate between general requests (H/Daphne) and specific fics (Harry marries a Fallen Angel)
