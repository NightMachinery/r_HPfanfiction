Just assume this is a Dark or Indy Harry:

Harry relaxed in his solar. "Ahhh, life was good" he thought as he took a pitcher of wine his servants prepared earlier. He was now the Hand of the King. It wasn't that difficult, to be honest. After he appeared in this strange reality three years ago, he was momentarily floored. All those strange people, and the language! Don't get him start on the language. But he persevered. In the end finding his place in this new world was quite easy. A couple of geminio charms on some stealthily summoned coins and he was golden. Who cared if they disappeared after a time, the merchant would just believe them stolen.

Being the resourceful person that he was, he went to the capital, King's Landing. A truly atrocious name. Talk about grandstanding. But still, he managed to worm his way into the court, with a few very careful Imperius curses and a couple memory charms.

It took him a few years, but now he had a comfortable life as the most powerful person in the kingdom.

That fat king barely stood a chance and currently he was ready to proceed with his plans. He will bring the light of the 20th century to these uncultured people. Printing press, electricity, perhaps even combustion engines if he figured out how they worked. But he had time. He will likely live to be over 100 years old, and considering he was only 20 right now, it still left him with plenty of time to uplift these idiots.

He had asked his scribes to draft preliminary laws on the emancipation of small folk, another stupid name. It would meet with some opposition, but memory charms worked wonders, as did the confounding charm.

Harry reached for his wine and took a sip, while thinking on the way he could help the people of Westeros.

...

He coughed.

"Damn, that must have went down the wrong pipe." Harry said as he poured another cup and quickly downed it.

He began to cough violently again.

As he went for his wand his legs gave out and he fell down.

"Aahh... I was wondering when it would begin to work." a simpering voice said.

The owner of the voice came into his view, towering over Harry who was violently clawing at his neck in a desperate attempt to regain some air.

It was Varys, looking over Harry with a face that screamed contempt.

"You didn't think that I wouldn't keep a good eye on you, did you?" Varys said.

Harry's eyes were red as he tried to say anything while finally reaching for his wand.

"None of that now, my dear magician." the Spider quickly removed the wand from Harry's hand before he could even think of a spell.

"Yes, you might think poison is such a bad way too kill a person. Especially one as powerful as yourself. But remember Harry, even the most powerful can be caught unaware and you are still only a man. I might had to up the dosage a bit, didn't want to risk you knowing a spell for antidotes or something similar. Ever since you came here, I watched you, I observed your every move and frankly I'm disappointed. You were quite foolish all things considered. Did you think you waving your stick wouldn't be observed by people? Perhaps not, the powerful often overlook those they think inferior. The reality will quickly reassert itself either way. Goodbye, Harry Potter."

With that Varys turned around and entered a small hidden passage, leaving the dying wizard on the floor.


** I can see him have problems going up against Maiar and first age elves and maybe some Numenoreans wielding forgotten magic, but I don't think there's anything in ASoIaF that can threaten him.

It could be fun to stick some horrific first age elves into like Worm or something and have them wreck everything though, like, say, Fëanor.

Muggle-repelling charms are one idea, but could possibly fail since orcs are often run by those who have them in their service. But disillusionment and apparition to points that you can see could almost certainly save you from trouble with them even if they are too many to actually be dealt with.

It was really to stick the middle finger to all the crossovers that try to make HP magic all powerful, when there are a multitude of ways that the story could have gone bad.

Not really about a specific fandom, although any fandom is viable for the prompt. It just depends on the imagination of the author.

So, I was not saying anything about your objection. Just clarifying the prompt.

I would say it's simply that the Silmarillion world is incompatible with the Worm world, so that we should never pit Scion against a Balrog, other Maiar, a Vala, or against first age elves. Instead, if we want the Silmarillion/Worm we should let something left behind influence things, like say, a Silmaril being washed into shallow water by Leviathan, or a Palantir being found.

Scion as a powerful being in a diminished world which the powers have not visibly intervened for a long time. An alternative could be to have him be a descendant of Ungolianth, so that he can in fact go up against the Valar and that's a reasonable idea considering his goals and philosophy.

In all seriousness asking for a stomp on a HP Wizard feels like a Star Wars VS Star Trek prompt that only ends with people taring their hair out. Sure a Wizard is just a human and subject to basic mortality but they still have reality bending powers.

Besides, this is Game of Thrones, a more reasonable outcome is that Harry is suddenly buried underneath several dozen Lannister and Tyrell cousins, as every family in Westeros suddenly realises that the new hand of the king has inheritable powers.

It's not like we've seen wizard vs muggle battles in canon, which makes it hard to be completely certain. You're right that it could be applied in a way that makes it basically impossible to beat in a fight, but getting cocky, falling into a trap, poisoning, assassination.. there's always a possibility something goes wrong.

**** I think you're partially right in that the only way Westeros has a chance of taking out a fairly-powerful wizard would be for them to get too cocky.

With the premise of a Dark/Indie!Harry with a wide knowledge of magic, there just aren't any avenues of weakness to pursue if Harry is even mildly paranoid. Assassination is impossible when Harry is wearing clothes with permanent shield charms enchanted on them (canon) and potentially other useful charms like the bubble-head and flame-freezing and such.

He can secure his home with muggle repelling charms and/or a sufficiently high enough age line, either of which would be impenetrable defenses.

He can ensure his entire staff/employees/etc aren't planning to betray him through weekly imperio+obliviate sweeps, which would have the handy side effect of making it impossible to discern /how/ he is rooting out any spies.

Poison would probably the biggest concern since it seems to be pretty dangerous even in the HP world (though the efficacy of muggle poisons on wizards is unknown) but practically, Harry can just use human transfiguration and apparition to eat anywhere he wants without anyone's knowledge, so unless his killers are willing (and have the funds) to poison an entire city he'd be pretty safe.

He doesn't have to worry being assassinated in sleep either, since one anti-Muggle charm is enough to keep any Muggle assassins out. Of course, there are magicals in this land, but that's what other wards are for. Burning down his house will not get him either because he can just apparate out.

Assuring the loyalty of his underlings is no problem: dark Harry is of course an expert in Legilimency, and he will regularly test them. For a wizard, currying favors with the population and gaining loyalty from people is easy too: food can duplicated, diseases and wounds can be healed, destroyed things can be reparoed, and true guilty ones can be identified.

As I said before, HP magic is way too powerful for this place.

For someone like Harry and Hermione, who also happen to know about modern Muggle technologies and social engineering, a country under their rules will quickly become the undisputed superpower.

***** Ehh... first of all, anti-muggle charm? You mean the one put upon the Leaky Cauldron? How would people find his home then? It makes sense for a retreat, but not if he actually wants to live in a muggle society. Wards are overpowered in fanon, in canon there are very few "wards", apart from the ones on Harry's home and not every wizard is an expert on everything, mind that.

Why would Dark Harry be an expert on Legillimency? Even Snape, who was definitely quite proficient didn't know every secret of teenage Harry (who had no idea what Occlumency even was and was never good at it later either). I think you think too much about fanon and the OP magic that fanfiction writers invent. Consider this:

A wizard comes into a world. Starts to cast magic. Gets a crossbow bolt, sniper shot, plasma beam to the back of his head. There are tons of other such scenarios I can imagine. Magic is super useful, but a single practitioner, without a society is very vulnerable. This is not magic vs muggle, but a single wizard in a non-magical world, which can end disastrously for the wizard.

EDIT: It's difficult to get a bezoar when you're dying of poison, as the incident with Ron showed. Wizards are just humans with special abilities, they are not immortal.

- Legion on the Broken Shore but during the attack on the Tomb of Sargeras, preferably when the giant portal for Argus opens. (Or right at that moment, for the giant space rift could be a valid explanation for the teleportation of the trio across the worlds)

- Or in BFA, either in Darhshore shortly before the burning of Teldrassil or later, throw them in Nazjatar for shit and giggles.

** Harry remembered the beozoar he kept in a secret pocket on his robes, having prepared for such an occasion, and as his vision blurred and his throat closed off, he fumbled it from the pocket and shoved it madly into his mouth, attempting his best at swallowing it whole.

In a few moments, after fierce pain and the terror of near death, the beozoar had saved him, freeing his throat as it touched it and made its way down his esophagus. He lay there on the cold stones, breathing heavily and being more thankful for air than he could ever imagine.

His green eyes flashing with anger, he was now deadly determined to take back his wand. It was about time for an Avada Kedavra...

Edit: sorry, I couldn't let him die like that.

Edit 2: explained how he could swallow when his throat was closed.

***** I tried to thought out this prompt through. A wizard without a wand is just a muggle and dies just as easily. It's quite a downside on HP magic (apart from fanon of course).

EDIT: Most people forget about that tidbit and invent wandless magic or other things to get over that disadvantage.

****** You are completely wrong, I'm afraid. Wandless magic canonically exists. Remember how a young Tom Riddle bragged to Dumbledore about being able to levitate objects, control animals, and other things? There you go, consciously directed (i.e. not just accidental) wandless magic.

There's also further elaboration with Pottermore's supplemental lore that the wand is a European invention, and not universally needed to use magic.

******* To add on, the reasons that prejudice from "purebloods" exists is because witches and wizards are born with magic in them as a physical quality. This is why squibs born to wizarding families are such an anomaly. Magic in the person is the whole deal, the wand is just a magical object that helps them direct the magic inside of them.

******* Wandless magic is a definite thing, but most wizards can't manage it. It's usually accidental magic that is wandless. An easy way to write a balanced ASoIaF fic would be to have the character break their wand or lose it. Then you get magic in an unreliable state. There's also magic in that world that you could tap into for story purposes.

Who even knows how the magic of the Night King and the Children of the Forest would compare to Harry Potter magic? You could write that however you want.

** As others have already said, a truly competent HP wizard with a wand would be pretty hard for the ASoIaF characters to beat, but an /incompetent/ HP wizard would make things interesting. I'm imagining a 3rd/4th year Neville having to overcome his timidity and lack of a good wand to survive in a very cutthroat world.

Or even instead of an incompetent wizard maybe just somebody who hasn't had that much training. A second year Hermione determined to end all the misogyny in Westeros has a very limited tool set with which to implement changes, which would make things interesting especially if the author didn't do some kind of cop out where Hermione invents a bunch of her own spells, discovers OP! magic, etc.
