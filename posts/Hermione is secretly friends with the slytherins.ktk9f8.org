Looking for fanfictions where hermione is still in gryffindor but is secretly friends with the slytherins and ends up dating one of them. Dramione is my favorite but it could be any hermione/slytherin pairing. Any good suggestions?

*** Both of these are so god damn good I feel like Hermione's ‘voice' in Detraquee is probably the most Hermione of Hermiones I've ever read. There's something about the rhythm of the words and all the big words and references I think. And the wry humour.

I need to read that again

  After a tumultuous Fifth Year for the Golden Trio, Dumbledore agrees to give them access to Order information. With that, Hermione is given an assignment---to be the handler for a secret faction of the Order that is comprised completely of Slytherins. This is the story of how---instead of blindly rejecting all Slytherins as a lost cause---Dumbledore went out of his way to bring them in from the dark, and how the brightest witch of her age took them to new heights. Full disclosure, I still don't know who's ending up with who. Sorry in advance.

  "All her growth was the conveying of a corpse of hope."(From 'The Rainbow', D.H. Lawrence)It was definitely the worst of times. Follow Hermione as she navigates through the quagmire: saving the world, getting top grades, falling in love, lust, and a whole lot of trouble; and comes out of it hopefully at least partially sane
