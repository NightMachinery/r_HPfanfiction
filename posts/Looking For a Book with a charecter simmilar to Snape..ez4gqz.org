I just finished reading linkffn(A Difference in the Family: The Snape Chronicles) and am truly in love with the character.

Could you recommend me some books ( not fanfics) with similar protagonist ?

Thanks.

  We have the testimony of Harry, but witnesses can be notoriously unreliable, especially when they have only part of the story. This is a biography of Severus Snape from his birth until his death. It is canon-compatible, and it is Snape's point of view.
