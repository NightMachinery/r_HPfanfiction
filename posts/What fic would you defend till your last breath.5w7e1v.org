Doesn't necessarily have to be something 'controversial', but maybe just a fic that you consider yourself to be the #1 fan of, or one you're unnatrually passionate about (besides your own obviously).


** Found this one on this subreddit a couple of hours back, and I'll defend it till the end of time.

Here's a quote:

#+begin_quote
  Harry -- Good day. I'm here to see Griphook

  Griphook -- Oh My God HARRY! You remembered my name!

  Griphook falls to the floor along with every other goblin in the building, convulsing heavily as they all cream their tiny pants from the sheer pleasure that Harry uttering one of their names gives them. Harry watches confusedly as a couple of goblins crawl up to him and start humping his legs. Thinking that this is their own Gobbledygook way of communication, he shrugs and starts humping them back.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom][Prince of the Dark Kingdom]].

Even though it's probably unfinished now.

It's just so /creative/ and does such great things with the canon characters and relationships, twisting tropes in such interesting ways.

My other favourite is literally the majority of Wolfstar stories. Especially older ones.

*** Yes, yes, yes. I love Stages of Hope.

There is something about it that is almost unique--it is /tender./ The friendship between Harry and Hermione, and Neville and Luna is beautiful. Soft yet sad, a sense of intimacy that is understated, but this is for the better.

The way Luna rubs Harry's hair and tells fairy tales to their little group. It's simply wonderful.

A small tip: stuff like that generally doesn't happen if you link by ID rather than the title. And if you want to fix it then you just delete the bot's comment, change the link command to the ID one to underp the bot, and then relink it via refreshing the bot (the commands for deleting and refreshing are on the right in the bot section). Not that there's a need to do it now, but you now know for the future.

  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.

**** While I can't really speak to the fic itself, having not finished it, people have argued that there's a dearth of female anti-heroes because of a double standard around "likeability" with male as compared to female characters. [[http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/08/unreal-shiri-appleby-rachel-female-anti-hero]]

And the Tamora Pierce books are feminist in that they represent girls doing traditionally "male" things, like becoming knights or blacksmiths, while boys can do traditionally "female" things, like be empathic and nurturing and in touch with their feelings. She even has a trans character in one of her newer series.

I was going to make a joke about how chances are you weren't just snarking because you consider yourself a radical, intersectional feminist rather than a liberal/mainstream one. So I peeked at your post history in the hope of understanding where you're coming from so I could persuade you, but apparently you're a Birther.

You actually believe Obama's birth certificate is fake despite evidence to the contrary, so I doubt anything I could say to change your mind about the meaning of feminism.

So in fact while a women who's "qualified" might be able to lift you out, due to the lower standards for them joining, they might not be able to lift someone heavier.

Your argument relies on 1% of women as an example for the entire population of females. Yes, there will always be outliers and people on the far right of the bell curve. But the fact is that the percent of women that are fit enough to be firefighters, soldiers, knights or whatever is so much lower than the percent of men. That's why it's not a good example of feminism, because men have an inherent advantage. Even if an averagely fit woman trained and trained until she was a better knight than 99% of men, a man of *at least* equal strength originally could train for the same amount and be stronger.

There's no avoiding the fact that when physicality matters, the strongest woman will never be stronger than her male counterparts.

This isn't an argument against feminism, so you can stop downvoting me.

***** This is from another thread because I can't help but voice my displeasure whenever I see this fic pop up on the subreddit.

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/5w4bbh/z/de7px8g]]

#+begin_quote
  It's like the author was held at gunpoint and forced to end their relationship in the stupidest and laziest way possible. I actually felt insulted while reading that part of the story.

I would check out the comment thread I linked. There are a couple other worthwhile comments.

*** That story is an amazing example on how to write a great story, but then ruin it by making the wrong decision every time the story came to a fork in the road. It's a very guilty pleasure read of mine because, in spite of its flaws, it's an engaging read.

** linkffn(Murder Most Horrid)

I love it for being a truly unique and well written AU, especially with regard to how characters turned out with different circumstances and influences.

  In a world where Voldemort never existed, Bellatrix Black is a cynical and dour detective working for the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, subdivision Magical Homicides. When she is tasked to solve a murder at Hogwarts, a certain resident genius called Hermione Granger happens to be her prime suspect. AU, Bellamione, liberal amounts of fluff.

** Ready for my down votes but... HPMoR, The Lie I've Lived and Bungle in the Jungle.

First I'll defend HPMoR primarily on how well it's written. A lot of people give it crap for being 'propaganda' and such and I won't deny that it is to some extent. However, the blend of the story with said 'propaganda' made it a very interesting read. The characters and plot was very driven and interesting. Any one who says otherwise hasn't read a word of it. Fanfiction is all about taking someone else's sandbox and making it your own. Less Wrong did this in a spectacular and well-written way. I'd go into it more but I'm on mobile lol

The Lie I've Lived is basically crack at its core but it's hilarious and I love the dialogue.

Bungle in the Jungle is fun.

*** Defend MoR on merits of "driven, interesting plot" all you want, but when I see someone asserting that it's well written, I see red. Well-written is a very particular qualifier and it encompasses so much more than spelling&grammar polish.

***** Brevity. Keeping track of what's happening. Understanding that more is not always better. Knowing where your plot is going and staying on course instead of meandering towards a hundred subplots that go on for hundreds of thousands of words while neglecting the main plot teased in the beginning. And, as [[/u/yarglethatblargle][u/yarglethatblargle]] said, pacing, which is practically nonexistent in MoR. It's less a coherent sequence of events than it is a collection of shorter stories that claims to be a novel.

That's not to say you can't write half a million words and stay on point, but MoR fails in that regard.
