I don't remember much about this fic. I think there was something to do with Harry going to the goblins and because he was the heir to two(three?) families he accidentally names Hermione and the Granger name as new nobility. Pretty sure this happened during their sorting but he didn't realize it until later.

  A more mature, knowledgeable and motivated Harry Potter goes to school. His fated encounter with Hermione Granger comes sooner as they share a compartment aboard the Hogwarts' Express during their first journey to school. With greater self-confidence, the muggle-born and halfblood will start the long needed reformation of the magical world, hand in hand. HP/HG/DG/LL/OC
