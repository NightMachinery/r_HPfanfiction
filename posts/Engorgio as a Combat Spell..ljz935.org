There are fics that talk about or make jokes about people using Engorgio on certain body parts and a Healer having to correct it, but what about using it intentionally on your opponent.

You're in a Duel against a female? Why not make them Lopsided with Engorgio on their chest.

Against a Male? why not beat them by making them put horses to shame, to the point they trip over their own tackle.

That's ignoring the lethal options of engorgio aiming for someone's heart and causing it to literally explode in their body, or things like that.


** Theres this brilliant fic where Harry gets a "domestic household spells" book and basically just turns them all into combat spells.

The slicing bread spell? Yep, just gonna slice up a person. Use the refilling charm on their lungs so they drown? A cleaning charm on their mouth so they suffocate and choke.

They go into how you really need to believe that that tree is a loaf of bread for it to work. So it takes a lot of effort and willpower and why it's difficult to do it in a battle but deadly if you can pull it off. Which Harry does at times to fucking deadly effects...

It's brilliant and very clever. linkao3(The Second String) if you're interested.

*** Off-topic but wasting willpower on imagining that enemies are household items that need to be charmed seems like a waste of energy when you can cut them to shreds with an obscure curse without even knowing what it's supposed to do.

**** that later gets brought up by another character when harry discusses his discovery of those spells, one of the other advantages are shields like protego dont stop it bc its just a household charm, though harry ends up mostly using the bread slicing spell for large objects that arent very mobile like ships masts

  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in a new world, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort.

  In the summer before his fifth year at Hogwarts, Harry is drawn to a room in Grimmauld Place. Like the Gryffindor he is, he enters the room without fear. The room is a library, and Harry is surprised to find that he's eager to learn. Then he gets the bad news: he's been accidentally expelled from Hogwarts, and he needs to be sorted again. Everyone is confident that he'll go straight back to Gryffindor, but with what he's been learning, Harry's not so sure.

** My general response would be --> everyone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth.

You can try to Engorgio all you want, but it won't be as efficient as Expelliarmus, simply because you can't really practice Engorgio as well as you can Expelliarmus. You need to make sure you have a repeatable, reliable outcome.

#+end_quote

Also: "Eat Slugs" --> which I realise now is a bit of a strange spell devoid of abhorrent dog latin. Is it just intent expressed in English resulting in the spell being cast? It resulted in the intended effect, in any case, just directed at the caster.

I'm starting to create a headcannon that all spells are incredibly dangerous and can all backfire spectacularly. The most dangerous wizard is the one who can reliably control the most powerful spells that would escape the control of more meagre wizards and consume them. No one wants to start a Wizards duel without rules because you'll end up hurting yourself more than others if you fail to apply your spell correctly (while under the stress of combat, and needing to defend yourself).

I wish more fics approached the "No magic in school corridors" with more severity. I.e. a stupid duel between two second years sees one of them in Saint Mungo's and the other is a hairs-breadth from being expelled. I want to see a fic where Harry engages in some Rocky Balboa style training montage but ends up nearly killing himself. Or perhaps the DA gets outed because kids keep getting injured in unexplained circumstances.

One plot bunny in my head is that Ron has incredible magical skill and the first evidence of this is his being able to cast a powerful conjuration like that, without using the right words, with a broken wand and still making it last as long as it did...while he was a second year student.

By the time he faces Voldemort, he is capable of playing with magic like play-doh.
