"A bunch of girls keep asking me to the Yule ball. I don't know why," Harry tells Sirius's head in the floo.

"It's those Avada Kedavra green eyes of yours," Sirius's inflamed head nods wisely.

"What?"

"Girls dig eyes that reminds them of lethal weapons. It's why I always go to muggle bars. Apparently my gray eyes are the same shade of gray as bullets that muggles use in their machine gum thingys. Instant lady charmer.

"Machine gum? I can't tell if you're trying to say gumball machine or machine gun. Either way, that can't be true!"

​


** 9 times out of 10, this makes me cringe massively too. Surely, you, as an author, can come up with something more creative than THAT as a description for green eyes. Hell, you could just say that they are GREEN. Toss in a romantic adjective. Not that hard.

THAT BEING SAID

The one time I do approve of it? MoD!Harry fics, a la, On A Pale Horse. Eldritch abomination Harry may absolutely have "Avada Kedavra green" eyes if it's done so to point out that it is now an /unnatural/ shade of green as opposed to what he had as a relatively normal human being.

***** I'm familiar with RGB being hex values through my usage of html and css.

This CSS code for example would make a webpage have an emerald background:

#+begin_example
  body {
    background-color: #50C878;
  }
#+end_example

You can also specify RGB values as hex when using Adobe Photoshop and presumably other graphics editing software as well. Pixlr is similar enough to photoshop, open [[https://pixlr.com/editor/]] and check out the color palette to see that it will accept hex values and also tell you the hex value of your current color.

****** I realize that one can specify rgb values on the screen as hex, but if we're talking about css here, the syntax to specify rgb values in an rgb format is would be background-color: rgb( 255, 255, 255), rather than background-color: #000000, which uses hex values to address rgb pixels, rather than rgb values to address rgb pixels. Coming back to the eyes though, it would probably make the most sense to use an rgba tag, since they allegedly glow in many fics that use the term emerald orbs.

***** Harry Potter and the Serpent Court by whitetigerwolf has Harry and Hermione become Basilisk animagi (other characters become their own magical animagus) who can turn their eyes yellow and petrify people while in human form. It's about a dozen chapters long and hasn't been updated since 2010 I think.

** Can I just say as an aside, I hate people saying avada kedavra when referring to the curse itself. As for kc green eyes, I think it's a good description for MoD harry that essentially becomes death. Even if that's an overused cliché at this point. My favorite MoD was in a Naruto xover. The fic itself wasn't too great, but the main thing was harry could only die of old age, and heal any unnatural ailment. Natural causes like age and allergies were off limits though.
