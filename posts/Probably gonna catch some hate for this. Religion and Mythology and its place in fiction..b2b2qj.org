I recently posted on another subreddit where I asked if christian themes/imagery had a place in fanfiction. I used christianity as my example due to my personal knowledge of it. Needless to say, I got about one answer taking the question seriously, before I got nothing but messages decrying the failures of christianity and generally insinuating that all religious people (particularly christians) are hypocrites and incapable of logic or rationality. We all know this song, and the resulting arguments, lets move along... I hope to avoid that in this question by telling those of you who will respond so. Message well and truly received, please focus on the actual question.

I have a story idea, and for this story idea I have a group of witches calling out to their god (unsure which deity at present) for a boon and basically they get Harry instead. Fair enough. But then there's the question of what it means to have deities running around doing stuff. You have to find reasons for them to intervene in mortal affairs, and you have to find reasons for them to NOT intervene. You need to know what makes them powerful and why. You need to know if they can be killed. Which is all well and good and I've been discussing it with my betas at length.

That is, until one of them asked a question. Basically...Okay, we know about the various pantheon religions (save hinduism and a couple others, because we hadn't reached them yet). We decided that people's belief empowers them and allows them to exist and coexist with mortals. (fair enough.). Hey Rhys, what about the Abrahamic religions in this scenario?

*Crickets Chirping*

I more or less go, 'um...yeah, I don't know if I want to touch that. I got chewed out recently...'

*more crickets*

A lot of people believe in the Abrahamic god. If you're going with god's being created and powered by belief then he's gonna be around on that basis surely? And if he's not around you need a reason why.

I pretty promptly agreed with the assessment, and pointed out I'd rather, for my own sanity, not go the 'God is Dead' (nietzsche) route just to get around the issue.

So what do I do here? If I include the Abrahamic (Christian, Jewish, Islamic) god, empowered spirit version or no, I'm going to catch a lot of hate. If I DON'T include him in any way shape or form, I'm gonna be chewed out for not doing so and feel a bit like a coward for avoiding the issue.

So what do I do here? I can't Include him in any way. And I can't NOT include him. So I have to strike a balance. I have no idea where this balance lies. I could use some advice guys and gals. I realize no matter what I do, I'm going to catch flak in any story I write. But I do want to do right by as many of my readers as possible.

ALSO. Just out of curiosity. Why is it not really commented on when other religions are mentioned, but if the Abrahamic ones are mentioned people go nuts? Is it that the other religions fuse better with the magical system in Harry Potter or something?

Regardless, I hope for advice here. Thanks for your input ahead of time.

I'm just highlighting how people argue the matter, not intending to get into a debate about it myself either. Ultimately I think that particular topic is secondary in importance to questions of doctrine such as love one another and judge not lest ye be judged type stuff. We (christians in general) should focus less on what we disagree on and more on the things that bind us together. SIGH. This is turning into a religious conversation. Which was not my intent as I'm not sure this is the venue to discuss it, but here we are none the less.

** I'm fond of treating old gods as ascended magical mortals. This works well enough for most pantheistic religions since their legends are generally more like soap operas than fables. When it comes to the Abrahamic monotheistic beliefs, I'd stick with the notion that His prophets are the ones like the other gods, but as a measure of humility they don't accept the power granted of the worship they're offered, because they have a tradition of distributing that power back to their followers at some level.

In all cases I would dismiss any notion that an overarching deity would interfere with the lives of men, as it ruins the entertainment value. Either a God that great is too intrigued by the struggle to interfere, or too massive in scope to even notice.

** I think there are two big problems with deities in HP.

Firstly is the problem of tone: it clashes terribly with the whimsical, down-to-earth nature of the HP magic system. Magic in HP is a thing you use to do the washing up. It is a technology analogue - mundane magic. It may well involve mystical ideas in its theory, but it's not really all that mystical in nature.

Even the magical creatures are demythologised - in mythology, Pegasus was the child of a god; in Harry Potter, pegasi are just another animal, albeit one that can fly and drinks single malt whiskey.

So I don't really think there's any way to make deities fit the HP world. The only way to have the tone be consistent would be to give them the same treatment as everything else - demythologisation. E.g. Ra was actually a powerful wizard. But then they're not really deities anymore.

Secondly is the problem of agency. Deities are by definition immensely powerful beings that dwarf humans in importance and power. Their existence brings the agency of humans into question. If Voldemort wins, he wins because a deity couldn't be bothered to intervene to stop him. Our characters' actions become merely the proximate cause of events. The true cause is whether or not a deity acts.

What does the story of a human conflict matter, if at any time a deity could come along and wipe the floor with the lot of them, and the only reason why it hasn't done so is because it's insufficiently interested? Once you introduce deities, you have introduced a cosmic scale to your story, a scale on which human conflict becomes insignificant. You thereby rob your own story of meaning. Consequences no longer matter, because we're watching two ants fight over a mound of dirt.

It's similar to why "Britain is a magical backwater" stories don't work: suddenly you have massively decreased the significance of the characters and the events in which we were previously emotionally invested.

Essentially, if deities exist, then they are the natural protagonists of the universe, not humans.

**** An interesting take on this is in the webseries "order of the stick". Where the Norse Gods Thor and Odin explain to one of the MC's why they can't intervene directly.

​

The theory is that every time one God ends up building up something for centuries it just takes one asshole god one night to burn it all down. So all the Gods made a binding pact that none of them can directly interfere.

​

However they can still "indirectly" interfere by talking to select people and giving them advice and such. The people in the story are sort of involved in a proxy war of the Gods.

** This probably isn't what you want to hear (and might be dodging the question a bit), but I think that you're probably going to make some people unhappy with either route, so you should do what you think works best for the story. Maybe include references to the fact that the Abrahamic God does exist but don't make Him pivotal to the story in any way? You could also use the fact that the Abrahamic God has three religions worth of people and beliefs to work within, so in a lot of cases his best course of action would be pretty 'hands-off' to keep from starting a war between his own followers.

** You might wanna go with the pre monotheism Israelite pagan route, do some research on El who later became Yaweh and Asherah who was his wife before the other gods were purged from the pantheon. That's the route I personally take in my won writing, and I tend to find it deeper and more meaningful than pulling from modern Abrahamic religions. Islam actually keeps a few of these concepts alive but not in the same ways they were originally presented, and studying the ways in which those original practices are reflected in modern religion can be fun + deeply enriching. A few notable scholars have done pieces on this if you follow biblical history and archeology (ever advancing fields I find myself consistently drawn to in my quest for mythological material) there's even a Netflix documentary that came out recently which provides a nice, easy to understand insight into the narratives and themes behind the modern bible, and why it was rewritten to be what it is today, and that can serve as a comprehensive source for more research material should you find yourself with any more questions.

Hope you have a good trip doing your research, I know it's one of my favorite parts of a project, and I wish you luck avoiding the rabid hivemind response people online can have.

As an aside, I'd love a link to your fic when you post it because it sounds really interesting and I love to know an author has really thought things through.

​

El did not "became Yahweh". El and Yahweh were two separate gods with El being the father of all gods and Yahweh being the god of war. What happened was that the cult of Yahweh decided he should be the king of gods instead and started removing El from scriptures and copy-pasting Yahweh's name in them.

** I think the best way to approach this is to be ambiguous, and have your characters know as little as possible of any deities (and maybe they presume more than they truly know). Perhaps there's a god for wizards and a god for muggles, or maybe there's just the one, who is different for every person. Not even wizards can say!

I might merge the ideas of them, personally, i.e. 'Wizard X prayed to The Great Z for a weapon against the dark. The Great Z, known to muggles as God, Allah, et cetera, was not all that they believed---it was far more, +fate's will itself+' (however you want to describe omniscient power).

However you approach it, I don't think it's necessary to explain the hows and whys of the divine, unless the god(s) themselves are directly involved in your story (as characters). Mystery and imagination are usually more intriguing than the reality, I think.

** I just feel like most of the religious feats would not impress the average wizard since they are part of the Hogwarts curriculum (water into wine, walk on water, survive in a desert, smite a tree) and even resurrection is a possibility (Voldemort had a Horcrux at 16/17). Therefore I don't see a lot of wizards following the religion out of conviction and lip service was probably the best you could hope for.

You can possibly go into a few shenanigans with a magical Papal state and wizards using the reformation and protestant league to get away from Rome, but that would still be more about political power than about beliefs.

Wizards could be into paganism though. It would fit well with the "persecuted by Christians" theme and some sort counter movement. And the stereotypical interpretation of pagan rituals (Stonehenge, sacrifices, naked dancing) fits a lot better with the theme of magic than "going to church". I mean, magic is considered evil by the monotheistic religions after all and generally punished permanently.

Another example at the root of gaming is And where you have paladins and clerics of many deities, some of which are deities of Light and Goodness and stuff, which draw again on those same sort of cultural imagery and traditions. The gods Pelor and Bahamut would be two of the big examples.

** One way to handle any god of your choice not existing (as oppsed to trying to make all the popular ones true and any made up/long dead religions relevant is that Deities aren't created by belief/worship/whatever it is they get from people, they're just an existing, probably immortal race that strengthened by it. Then if there never was a Rhys (also did not know he had a less confusing name than just God) spirit the whole religion doesn't do anything.

No need to explain why people believe in a god that doesn't exist when there's others that do, based on the number of mutually exclusive religions in the modern world people are apparently pretty good at that.

** Another that comes to mind and does sort of semi-cover this is Darth Drafter's /The Little Veela That Could./ There does not appear to be an actual deity figure in there but it certainly covers the religious aspect of it quite well. In fact, a cathedral in France somewhere is one of the repeat set-pieces that just keeps coming back. Been a while since I read through it though.

** I don‘t want to focus on it to much and think there are great answers in this thread already; if you want to use the monotheistic beliefs that is totally okay and your choice.

But you also have to decide how deep you want to got on the topic. Just including the god, go as far as the religion itself or even the structures that grow from their. Different levels define how you can portray it „believably“. Do you just want an Angel that occasionally appears in the story, a tangential mentioning or entrenchment and close contact with Christian institutions?

The deeper you go the more divers, both positive and negative, it becomes. That is the point where it becomes the most controversial, because it isn‘t an abstract thing like god/angels anymore, but gritty/wonderful reality.

In the want you decide where you go with it. Where do you want to focus, what to do you want to mention, what is not worthy of mentioning. My advise would be, that independent of the level you want to take it, you should treat it like a coin. There are at least to sides to it and mentioning one leads to the other because they share the base.

Or as stupid as it sounds; watch Supernatural from season three onwards and take your own spin to it.

Actually other religions fuse worse with Harry Potter magical system.

** I think it's completely fine to include it, though perhaps put a note about it at the start of the story. Real world religion and mythology is an incredibly rich/detailed source of material to draw from - and integrating it into a world can give some fascinating twists.

The note on the Dresden series is probably a good one to draw from, although I haven't read any of those books. There is an interesting crossover fanfiction with that series and harry potter that I enjoyed, and the way that concepts integrated there seemed well done (with dual magical worlds).

As for why people might go nuts over it, I think it's more familiarity. A lot of people have firsthand experience with christianity/other abrahamic religions, and often negatively. The types of people most likely to be involved in the online fanfiction community are less likely to have had that amount of firsthand experience with other religions (eg - Buddhism, Hinduism, etc), and so that visceral reaction isn't present.

** There are so many ways to think about this, but one way is to say that magic is based on (free) will rather than spiritual faith. Since faith is basically putting yourself in the hands of something greater it serves to reduce your free will and therefore weakens your magic potential. For this reason most magicals avoid thinking about religion and just live their life as best they can. However, when something super scary happens a few martyrs/saints come together to willingly weaken themselves in order to receive help from a 'higher' power. You don't need to be particular on what that power is so you wouldn't need to decide on a specific religion.

** Well, the question is why do you want to introduce the religion into your story. I am a Christian myself and I was looking for some good religious stories for myself.

It is kind of weird that in the country where majority of Muggles at least nominally belong to the Church of England (for you, Americans, not every state in the world has separation of the state and church) there is no mention of anything religious anywhere. Of course, the true reason is probably that Ms. Rowling wanted to have her book approachable all over the world (or she probably didn't think about that at all), but sometimes it is really a bit ridiculous. All those Christmas, Easters, and no mentioning of school chapel (every large British educational institution has one, of course)? All those godfathers and godmothers and no baptisms (try to imagine Sirius Black present to the baptism of Harry in the church of St. Jerome in the Godric's Hollow)? Tolkien in LotR could get away with having religion-less universe, although historically it is more certain than anything that Aragorn would quite certainly sacrifice to some deity before the Battle of the Pelennor Fields (but Tolkien was rather traditional Catholic so he probably didn't like the idea of inventing a pagan religion). Nothing.

This religion-lessness mostly continues in the fanfiction universe. There are really few stories which take religion seriously and even less which make a good job of it.

In completely random order (just as I found it in various bookmark lists):

1. linkffn(6494461) This is sweet, not super deep, but lovely retelling of missing parts of DH from the Hermione's point of view, who is practising Anglican and carries with her “Prayers for Young Girls” as surprisingly relevant guide through her struggles. Prayer in face of Voldemort (or Bellatrix Lestrange) is here surprisingly convincing (I was always afraid that such stories end up like the Hogwarts, School of Worship, which is IMHO abomination).
2. linkffn(3077936) Severus Snape's cover is blown and he is saved on the run from Death Eaters by a wizarding priest who teaches him a lot about faith and himself. Not bad, the heart of the author is certainly in the right place, but it seems to me that he never figured out how to finish the story and it somehow hangs in the middle.
3. linkffn(3388041) for change, here Severus is not Roman Catholic but Jewish, but the main hero are OC person (Jake) and Anthony Goldstein and their trials and tribulations with trying to be faithful Jew in quite secular environment of Hogwarts. Except, it is apparently not as secular as Ms. Rowling talking from the Harry's point of view lead us to believe. There are Christians (Terry Boot, Cedric etc.), of course Patils are Hindus, there are some Muslims IIRC, and all of them are trying to navigate waters of Hogwarts as much as they can. Sympathetic, but the author is apparently Jewish and he is struggling with understanding of Christianity (that's the one I can judge) rather desperately.
4. linkao3(7292632) Severus Snape, brought up as a Roman Catholic, when dying in the Shrieking Shack manages to pull out antidote and transfer with his emergency Portkey to the friendly Irish Roman-Catholic friar who cures him. Apparently, he secretly practised his faith all those years including confessions, and he is now trying to reconcile with his past. Not bad, sometimes a bit too preachy and too much teaching the Catholic liturgy for every occasion, but story makes sense. One of the few fanfiction stories which noticed that the Good Friday Agreement happened 22 days before the Battle of Hogwarts.
5. linkao3(4426211) Foundation of Hogwarts as viewed by Brother Brendan (from the film “Secret of Kells”) who turns out to be Fat Friar eventually. Actually, not much religious, but sweet nevertheless.
6. linkao3(7460772) A rare example of good medieval story from the HP universe. Brother Thomas turns out to be a wizard and he is sent by his prior, Robert Grosseteste (true historical figure, famous medieval philosopher) to Hogwarts. Although he is always suspicious whether his powers are not a bit demoniacal, he is forced by God (and the Sorting Hat) to be humble friar in the wizarding world. Lovely description of medieval wizarding world, which is precisely not developed enough to be persuasive (he participates in developing the Floo powder). Brother Thomas is of course later the Fat Friar (who cannot leave his students for whom he cares pastorally). Sir Cadogan is present as well as his friend and not completely crazy knight.
7. [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/636071]] we all suspected it, but now it is clear, Hermione is Jewish (actually, it seems to me as the only explanation why super-bookish girl from country with mandatory religious education has no idea where “Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.” or “The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.” come from) and she is dealing with the punishment for Obliviating her parents. Jewish wizarding tribunal and all that jazz. Not bad but unfinished and sorely missing the conclusion.

The crazy thing is that it seems to me this is really it. If anybody knows about any other good religious wizarding story (no mocking, no anti-religious) let me know.

Tolkien did in fact create the gods of Arda. Eru, the high God. Valar, who I believe would be comparable to the role of a lesser god and the Maiar who are akin to Angles. But Humans in Arda seems to be bound in a Ragnarok-esque cycle of being reawakened in a hall where they will spend eternity until the Final Battle with Morgoth. So I'd say they'd place the lesser god who are in charge of this hall as equally important as Eru himself.

​

I have no doubt that one of the reason it didn't get any notability in the main books was because of his religiousness. But to say he didn't make it would be false. But the fact that you have people that'd have met not just angels but also lesser gods would mean that a more unified religion is likely to develop. Which means it sort of loses its significance.

I am a Protestant, so for me “religion” means more “humans activity towards deity” (sacrifices, liturgy, this sort of thing) rather than just “existence of God” (and yes this understanding of the word is paradoxically non-Biblical, James 1:27) . Yes, certainly there is God in Arda universe (BTW, beginning of Silmarilion is one of the most beautiful description of rise of Evil I know about), but nobody does anything about it. There are no prayers (almost, at least no explicit ones), no sacrifices, no priests, etc.

The same goes for the Harry Potter-universe (that line in the DH1 movie “Would they've been there, Hermione, ... my mom and dad?” is I am afraid just Hollywood's poor attempt of libation towards American Evangelicals to placate them).

  Long before the Statute of Secrecy, when Kings still sought counsel from wizards and scholars debated magic at the great centres of learning, England seethed as her nobles struggled to check the power of the King -- and one young friar found his new path taking an unexpected turn.

** Unless you are including a specific religious theme in your story that is central to what is being told I'd shy away from using an actual religion. I personally never enjoy authors including religious aspects in their story as it seems very forced and rarely adds something to the story. But that's different if you go for a more archaic religion like Greek/Roman/Egyptian gods. That's a little farther from home for most people.

** The problem with having the Abrahamic god exist in your setting is that you need to find a damn good reason for evil to exist. Why would a benevolent, omniscient and omnipotent god let innocent children die? Especially in a world with magic, where at least the wizards know how easy it would have been to save everyone. If god exists, why didn't he answer prayers and save people? Were those people praying for help not worthy? Why did the holocaust happen? Why starve so many people? You can get around that question with "gods cannot intervene directly" and "gods are jerks" for a number of pantheons, but for the Christian god, that doesn't work. The Christian god is a walking plot hole. And you don't want that kind of plot hole in your story.

Further, it might shock some Americans, but in Western Europe, no one really gives a damn about religion any more. There's about 7% left who visit Church in Britain. Religion just doesn't matter much - certainly not in daily life.

This is the reason that I react negatively to stories written to conform with the religion of the author. linkffn(Harry Potter and The Iron Lady by mugglesftw) is a good example of that. Around chapter 19 Ron spontaneously breaks out in prayer.

  "I think we should pray for Neville and Dean and Seamus," Ron blurted.

Yeah, no. American readers might not react to it, but that killed the story for me. The story happens in /Britain/. Church attendance is low, and only weirdos save their virginity for marriage.

*** Hey there Starfox. Nice to hear from you again. Answering those questions in real-life is of course a subject of much debate, even amongst the religious, and not really...appropriate/necessary to our efforts here I believe, right? That doesn't sound quite right, but I admit it is late here and I'm very tired. To a certain degree such a being would by nature need to be mysterious for story purposes I think. However I believe we could hammer out some preliminary answers to work with for a story. If you are willing, let's treat this like a thought experiment/exercise. Like one of those debates they made us do in school where we had to defend the opposing position wholeheartedly. If you are NOT willing to indulge in such an experiment, fair enough and we'll go no further on this together. Let's run on the assumption, for the sake of storytelling, that a Just and Loving God exists. How would you tentatively answer those questions you posited in a way that makes sense? Keep in mind we have to try to assume things are not entirely senseless, cruel or uncaring on the part of this deity. I hope you will indulge me on this, as I'm genuinely curious what you come up with. I'm headed to bed for a bit but will gladly try and revisit this experiment with you after I've done a couple things in the morning. Best wishes.

**** I don't have an answer for the question why in Harry Potter a benevolent, omniscient and omnipotent god would let evil exist and innocent children die. That's why I called it a plot hole.

Old Gods? Pagan pantheons? That's easy. Gods are limited and/or jerks.

A god that doesn't intervene, but judges souls after death? Works as well.

But the Abrahamic "I'm the only god and I can see and do everything and I love you" god doesn't work in a story. Not just because evil happens, but also because the god's existence cheapens the heroes' achievements. Either he intervenes, and renders the struggle moot, or it feels like a training run - "good work, kids. If things had gone bad, I'd have done something, but thanks to you, I didn't need to."

** Before my comment into the tract on the religion in HP fanfiction (see above), what I wanted to say were two things:

1. Why do you want to have religion in your story? Make sure you know your reasons before doing so.
2. Why do you care how much people will hate you? If you shoot for the popularity, I am sorry to disappoint you, but with million or so stories around, you are riding towards obscurity most likely. Trying to make people like is useless idea, which will make you bitter. Write only if your own joy of writing is your biggest compensation. You won't get much more else.
