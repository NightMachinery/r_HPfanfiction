What's a fic you've read and couldn't put down? Or a series that keeps you up until 3am so you're on a coffee IV at work the next morning?

*All ships/genres/tropes welcome!*


** linkffn(Limpieza de Sangre) is excellent, and recommended here a fair amount, as it should be. [[/u/TE7][u/TE7]] has pretty much only written good stories as far as I've read. The sequel is about 8 chapters in though, which will bring your binge to a halt.

  Harry Potter always knew he'd have to fight in a Wizarding War, but he'd always thought it would be after school, and not after winning the Triwizard Tournament. Worse still, he never thought he'd understand both sides of the conflict. AU with a Female Voldemort.

** linkao3(Turn by Sarasgirl) Is my absolute favourite, it centres around a middle aged Harry going through a midlife crisis. It's a wonderful story. (Harry/Draco)

linkao3(No Glory by Obsidianpen) thematises what would happen if Harry wasn't killed in the forrest, instead Voldemort takes him prisoner. It's amazing but absolutely heart wrenching.

  The Dark Lord divines what Harry Potter is in the Forbidden Forest, and revelations lead to incomprehensible consequences. Lord Voldemort has won... and the dystopia is damning. A tale of a fallen hero, dark desires, and a Dark Lord's obsession with something he has lost and finds himself unwillingly lusting after: a soul.

  "We don't drown. We float. That's how Muggles used to tell, isn't it?"-When Regulus is five, he nearly drowns in the sea off Blackpool. When Regulus is eleven, his brother befriends a ghost.It's not until Regulus is eighteen and ready to die that the Black family's darkest secret finally unravels. It might, perhaps, change everything.(A coming-of-age story with mind magic, star charting, pink petit-fours, two diaries, and a ghost.)[Edit: SPOILERS in the comments.]

  Petunia performs a bit of accidental magic. It says something about her parenting that Uchiha Itachi is considered a better prospect for raising a child.
