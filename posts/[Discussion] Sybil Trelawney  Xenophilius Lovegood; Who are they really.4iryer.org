In my current story, Sybil and Xeno are students a little older than the Marauders. I'm having trouble writing their personalities with regards to how they would act as teenagers. I want to keep their characterizations close to canon. Would you guys give me some pointers or ideas, please?


** I think the clues to Trelawney are in her drinking and this exchange with Umbridge:

#+begin_quote
  DU: And you are a great-great-granddaughter of the celebrated seer Cassandra Trelawney?

  ST: Yes

  DU: But I think --- correct me if I am mistaken --- that you are the first in your family since Cassandra to be possessed of the Second Sight?

  ST: These things often skip --- er --- three generations.
#+end_quote

She desperately wants to be a "True Seer" but knows she doesn't match up to her great-great-grandmother, Cassandra. In fact, she thinks she isn't a seer at all. She tries to maintain a facade she desperately wishes were true, but the lies and her inadequacies eat at her. She knows people don't believe it and that's why teaching at Hogwarts is the best and worst thing. Some of the children believe in her. But ultimately being at Hogwarts is terrible for her. She hasn't come to term with the lack of her abilities so she wallows in her lies and guilt, perpetuating her misery, turning to drinking. She never develops a life or career outside of her lies and is stagnant, festering.

I'm guessing her name was either "seen" by Cassandra or a desperate hope from her parents. Either way, it weighs heavy on her because she's disappointing someone no matter what. Proving her great-great-grandmother Cassandra (a true seer) wrong or dashing the hopes of her parents. The spelling of it probably bothers her too. It's not Sibyl, but Sybill. In her bad moments, she probably thinks this indicates and foretold her lack of (apparent) abilities- not quite a prophetess.

I think her feelings of inadequacy stifled her abilities and that a happy, well adjusted Trelawney would be a much better seer. I see the prophecies she made as those so large and important that they had to burst out no matter what sort of blocks she'd inflicted on herself. Anyways, that's how I see her. She needs to get out of her head

*** Thank you for the sum up. That's just the sort of thing I needed, so now I can see how I need to write her as a teenager. Insecure, probably a little shy or maybe just introverted, always trying to prove herself and be everything to everyone in her life while falling sadly short in (almost) all endeavors. I can see her cultivating some of her 'otherworldly' persona but not be completely wrapped up in it yet, and already making false predictions--or sometimes not so false--she's bound to get something right eventually. Maybe even declaring fervently that Divination is her favorite subject when it really isn't, just because of who she's related to.

Once again, thank you.

*** Thank you as well. Half the time when I look for something on Pottermore I don't find anything, so I didn't even think to look there this time.
