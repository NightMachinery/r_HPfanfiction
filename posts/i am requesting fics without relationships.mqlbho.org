simply tell me your favorites, i dont care what its about i will read it anyway because i am sick of reading romance. preferably no hermione-centric fics, fics with original characters that arent only in the background, or reader inserts


** Unfortunatly, while I read fics which aren't all too focused on romance, most of mine still have (slash) pairings in them.

Here are some gen fics I found

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10588629]]) This one is really amusing. Highly rec

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/790488]]) This one is really really good. Highly recommend. Very plotheavy.

If I could perhaps interest you in this fic which is romance but very unique. Brilliant woldbuilding. Doesn't seem like it would work, works brilliantly.

Lavender Brown/Tom Riddle Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19949440]])

Also this is really good. It's a wip and so far no pairing is really written into this but there are signs so perhaps not exactly whatcha lookin for. Soo good. Brilliant worldbuilding. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/284278]]

  Once upon a time, Harry Potter hid for two hours from Dudley in a chemistry classroom, while a nice graduate student explained about the scientific method and interesting facts about acids. A pebble thrown into the water causes ripples.Contains, in no particular order: magic candymaking, Harry falling in love with a house, evil kitten Draco Malfoy, and Hermione attempting to apply logic to the wizarding world.

  Harry is summoned to an alternate universe still suffering under Voldemort less than an hour after his own defeat of the bastard. Worse, he's not the first Harry Potter they've called on this way. Worst yet (at the moment), there is no way back home. But give Harry time, and he's likely to find something that's even worse.

  Lavender takes one step forward and -- just like the snap of a finger, the blink of an eye, the drop of a pebble -- Hogwarts is left behind. There's no jump, no flashes of light, no whirlwinds of disconnected images. Just one little step; behind stood her war and in front stands 1947. "Huh," she says to herself, "didn't see this in the tea leaves."
