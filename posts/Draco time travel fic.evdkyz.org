I'm just looking for good fanfics where Draco Malfoy travels back to first year, or really any year, just time travel.

  This is it. This is the end of it all.Draco Lucius Malfoy has survived the Second Wizarding War and has been miraculously kept from going to Azkaban. The Aurors have his wand while he's on parole, but at least he's a free man. Free to do whatever he wants, including go to Diagon Alley where people shun him at best and throw curses and slurs at worst.Draco made the wrong decisions. He doesn't belong in this world anymore, this world he helped to create. When he finds a way to go back to when it all began, he realizes this isn't the end.This is just the beginning.UPDATE : Vietnamese translation now available!! Thank you, ChunyuPink!!!
