Hello!\\
Do you have any FMA x HP fic where Edward Elric is hurt/tortured and sent to hogwarts? Some angst fanfic and completed would be good!\\
Thank you!


** *disclaimer tho most of these aren't finished & idk about ed being hurt and tortured tho

But still fma/hp recs galore that i adore dearly

I think silent walrus' linkao3(snipers solve 99% of all problems) is imfamous enough but gonna rec anyway

if that doesn't work: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20644262/chapters/49023794]]

there's also: linkao3(he's a killer queen, sunflower, guillotine)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22365040/chapters/53430703]]

linkao3( If Anyone Pulls One of Those Sticks on Us, Burn It)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12255411/chapters/27848412]]

part of a series called Sticks & Circles

  Ed had thought, after the whole Promised Day, homunculus, entire country harvested for alchemical batteries thing, the batshit quotient of his life would have settled down some. He really ought to have topped out the meter with that one. But no. The bullshit is just getting started. “Are you fucking kidding me,” Ed demands. “The wizards?” Podfic & Chinese translation available! See notes

  He has to be the weirdest Hufflepuff Harry's ever seen.Scratch that, he's the weirdest Hufflepuff Hogwarts has ever seen.(One thing everyone could agree on: NEVER call Edward Elric short.)

*** Drying sunflower seeds at higher temperatures helps destroy harmful bacteria. One study found that drying partially sprouted sunflower seeds at temperatures of 122℉ (50℃) and above significantly reduced Salmonella presence.
