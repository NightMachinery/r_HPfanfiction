Just to clarify. By craziest I do not mean Harry/Ginny like the last time this was asked.

***** Could it be called mpreg if the sock doesn't have anything resembling a female reproductive tract? I don't know the rules and conventions of that subgenre. I know the sock is referred to with feminine pronouns, but maybe the fact that it's a piece of clothing could warrant an exception?

But seriously, though, well done for finding the squickiest fic I've probably ever read.

I personally have no issue with selfcest when it involves alternate realities (most of my squick with incest comes from thinking of a family member in that way, and AR Selfcest is essentially fucking a stranger.), so it took me reading the latter pairing elsewhere to realize that WAS crazy, lol.

**** Aside from Bellatrix being batshit insane, twice Harry's age, and the most devoted servant of his arch enemy, who he is expected to kill or be killed by? And, later in the story, killed the closest thing Harry had to a family? And is responsible for torturing Neville's parents into vegetables? How in the world would that NOT be crazy?

Don't get me wrong, the BellaxHarry fic that I could stand (I'm very pick about how a story flows. Not too much dialogue or descriptions, characters aren't OOC, proper grammar and spelling...) was really good. I enjoyed it immensely.

*** I actually found a Harry/Fem!Harry that I really liked. Equal and Opposite, IIRC. Essentially, Harry finds another mirror like the Mirror of Erised, but this one shows your 'Equal and Opposite', which is Fem!Harry. Anything further is spoilers, but it gets Dark, fast, with rape/love potion abuse, torture, and such, so caveat lector.

The author of Holly Evans and the Spiral Path has a Fem!HarryxHarry fic, too, though I'm less fond of it.
