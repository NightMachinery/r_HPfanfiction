I don't care what the plot is about, but my only request is no slash. Anything where Seamus is a main player.


** You won't find too many non-slash Seamus fics, as most of them are Seamus/Dean fics.

  An Auror-in-training, Seamus is curious about the vandalism that Pansy Parkinson is refusing to report to the Auror Office. An apprentice reference librarian, Pansy thinks Seamus Finnigan is taking the mickey when he claims he needs her assistance for The Irish Wizarding Times' crossword competition. But one favour turns out to be worth another, as a pair of smiling Irish eyes steals someone's prickly heart away.
