One of the more nonsensical elements of canon is the combination of wizards being totally ignorant of muggle culture while Hogsmeade is supposedly one of very few all-wizard towns. So most wizards have muggle neighbors and still don't get that this is inappropriate:

#+begin_quote
  The man with the watch wore a tweed suit with thigh-length galoshes; his colleague, a kilt and a poncho.
#+end_quote

No way! This is a deliberate display of how ignorant they are of muggle culture as a way to show off to other wizards how rarely they're forced to enter the less prestigious muggle neighborhoods most wizards have to live in.

How is Arthur so ignorant? He isn't, really. He doesn't get the game, and he spends more of his time talking with deliberately-obtuse ministry workers than actual muggles, so his terminology is a little confused, but his actual facts are pretty good. Compare Arthur's clothing to the other ministry workers:

#+begin_quote
  He was wearing what appeared to be a golfing sweater and a very old pair of jeans, slightly too big for him and held up with a thick leather belt.
#+end_quote

My dad (a muggle) has worn this outfit plenty of times.


** As a running gag in a fic, this sounds awesome.

As actual canon? No, people are generally ignorant of other cultures. I make fun of fics that have "muggleborn don't understand our culture" but it's kinda like going to the US to Canada.

** According to [[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/clothing][JKR's Pottermore posts,]] even the most out-of-touch and anti-muggle wizards /do/ know about muggle culture. The Statute of Secrecy has a list of rules of "blending in" when going among muggles. The wizards that go around wearing nightgowns in public (like the breeze between the knees guy from the Quidditch World Cup) know what pants are, they just like walking around with their nuts out.

#+begin_quote
  Day to day, however, even those who detest Muggles wear a version of Muggle clothing, which is undeniably practical compared with robes. Anti-Muggles will often attempt to demonstrate their superiority by adopting a deliberately flamboyant, out-of-date or dandyish style in public.

  Some members of the magical community go out of their way to break the clothing clause in the Statute of Secrecy. A fringe movement calling itself Fresh Air Refreshes Totally (F.A.R.T.)* insists that Muggle trousers ‘stem the magical flow at source' and insist on wearing robes in public, in spite of repeated warnings and fines.

**** */puts on tinfoil hat/*

What did you expect from a man who forces a baby into the home of a young family who didn't want one, who already had their hands full with a baby of their own? Petunia must have been only 23 years old when Dumbledore dumped Harry on her doorstep with a letter explaining that her sister was dead.

#+begin_quote
  Aunt Petunia's hand was trembling. She looked wildly around the kitchen as though looking for an escape route, but too late---the envelope burst into flames. Aunt Petunia screamed and dropped it.

  An awful voice filled the kitchen, echoing in the confined space, issuing from the burning letter on the table.

  "Remember my last, Petunia."
#+end_quote

Then Dumbledore sends a threatening letter when Petunia is upset about her son almost having his soul sucked out by invisible monsters none of them can see.

It's hard to say that Dumbledore truly respects muggles when he overrides their will and desires whenever he believes the situation calls for it. He Confunded and lied to Mrs. Cole from Tom Riddle's orphanage, when she was Tom's legal guardian, and by all rights had a valid, legal reason to know about his magic, like all muggleborn/muggle raised guardians do.

***** I've always seen Dumbledore is a bit like Atticus Finch in Go Set A Watchman. A good man who protects the oppressed (muggles/African Americans), but not because he sees them as equals- rather, as someone who sees them as inferior and believes his kind (wizards/whites) have a paternalistic, "white man's burden" responsibility to "show them their place in the world."

Does he do things that are objectively good and help the oppressed? Yes. Is his reasons for doing so racist and condescending? Also yes. It makes for a complex character who can avoid the evil!Dumbledore and incompetent!Dumbledore tropes while still being someone who Harry can strongly disagree with ideologically, even if they are on the same side.

*** One of the reasons I like to consider Pottermore as quasi-canon is the line about muggle clothes being more practical than robes. Why can't wizards just use magic to make robes practical? They've gone to all that trouble to have separate cultures, and their arts and crafts aren't going to create something new? Baloney!

A lot of design choices in muggle clothing come from a need for freedom of movement. But, what if you could just charm your clothes to move around you? You might choose to wear yards and yards of material that billows dramatically around you, but the hem can fluff itself out of the way if it touches the toe of your shoe, or a stair step, so you'll never trip on it. Your sleeves could be huge and dramatic, but could be charmed to fluff themselves out of the way of a lamp on a side table, or other obstacles, so you'll never accidentally knock anything over. Witches' skirts could be charmed to rearrange themselves into something like culottes if they sense a broomstick. Huge hats could fold themselves to fit inside door frames.

My headcanon is that magical fashion dictates that a well-bred witch or wizard wears clothing that would be extremely impractical for a muggle to try to make or wear.

** They have more options besides Hogsmeade or buying a cookie-cutter muggle house in a conventional muggle subdivision with dozens of potential threats to the Statute within walking distance.

With apparation, the floo network, and even brooms rendering muggle concerns about distance and easy transportation moot, a wizard could comfortably live miles and miles away from anywhere and anyone, and still have a two minute commute to work, or be able to pop out to the shops within minutes.

Consider this, during the industrial revolution, a lot of agricultural workers in rural villages found their labor in the fields rendered moot with increasing mechanization, so they moved to the growing cities to work in factories. Now this is muggle history. Moving to find work is something that muggles do. As the tiny rural villages emptied of muggles, any wizards living in the village could have stayed behind. Perhaps enough of the muggle population moved out that the village was considered gone, and it was just one or two houses left that had wizards. A good chunk of wizarding housing stock could come from houses of wizards that were left behind by changing muggle population patterns.

** There is a disconnect between wizards' ignorance of Muggles and their success in wizarding secrecy. Kingsley Shacklebolt refers to firearms as "firelegs"; he also successfully infiltrates the office of the Prime Minister with no one noticing.

There are two possible explanations (which are not mutually exclusive):

1. As you say, the appearance of ignorance is cultural. Wizards understand Muggles well enough, they just enjoy mispronouncing things etc.

2. Magic is very good at covering up their mistakes.

** After reading Strangers at Drakeshaugh, I realised that the Statute of Secrecy makes it very problematic to actually mingle with neighbours. It was sweet to see the Potters swap babysitting and recipes and just hang out with another family from their new school, but as Jacqui kept noticing the signs that something was unusual about the Potters, I kept waiting and wishing for the big reveal. Until I realised that it wasn't going to happen, that legally it /couldn't/ happen, that if the Charltons finally saw too much, they wouldn't be brought into the secret; they would be Obliviated. >! Which happens in one of the later books, when the Charltons' six year old sees accidental magic and Harry has to remove the memory. Which is apparently happening with increasing frequency.!<
