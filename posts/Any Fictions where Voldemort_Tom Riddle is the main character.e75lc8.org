** Birds of a Feather by babylonsheep is a slow burn romance with Tom and Hermione, set in the 40s. It's pretty great, really captures Tom Riddle in my opinion. The first few paragraphs in and I instantly thought, "Yeah, I can see this little sh*t becoming Voldemort."

Hermione, who's born in this time period, not time displaced, is on point as well. Watching the two verbily spar over their vastly different moralities is a lot of fun.

** Hi! My fic fits this category! It's almost complete- the next chapter is the last one and it'll be finished before the end of this year. Tom Riddle is the central character, with the only OC being a psychiatrist who interacts with Tom and never isolated. That being said, the story is a Time Travel one where Tom comes to the future right at the start of the fifth book. Tom however, is the main character. I should warn you, the story is pretty heavy!

*** Oh my god! I actually read this fic a week ago. I was actually surprised that a fic so compelling and well thought out had such few reviews on ffnet. Definitely an underated gem.

**** Oh wow!! Yeah- it's really surprised me how unnoticed it is! Not that I'm trying to be vain, but my last story was fairly popular so this is an interesting experience! The story is wild, really sad but we're winding down! I have exams this week but I'm planning on writing the final chapter maybe Wednesday? Anyway! It may be done this week!

** I've read many stories in which Voldemort or Tom Riddle is a secondary protagonist, but few fics have him as the only focal character. Here are some with him as solo protagonist that I have enjoyed:

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6623293/][Realignment]] - (67k+ words ; COMPLETE) School-age Tom Riddle is the target of an assassination attempt by a powerful wizard (a time traveling adult Harry Potter), which leaves Tom with no choice but to accept Dumbledore's offer of guidance and protection. linkao3(6623293)

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15499683/][The Unwinding Golden Thread]] - (53k+ words ; COMPLETE) Harry accidentally travels back in time to the year Tom Riddle opened the Chamber of Secrets. Things go sideways in an unexpected way. Love never enters the equation. linkao3(15499683)

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2501577/1/Riddle-s-War][Riddle's War]] - (28k+ words ; COMPLETE) Riddle is evacuated to the countryside along with the other orphans during a summer of the London Blitz. linkffn(2501577)

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13088810/9/Carpe-Noctem][Carpe Noctem]] - (76k+ words ; ONGOING) After his death, Voldemort awakens in the body of his teenage self. With his sanity restored, he resolves not to repeat the mistakes that lead to his ignominious defeat. linkffn(13088810)

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2595818/1/Rectifier][Rectifier]] - (76k+ words ; DEAD) In another universe, Tom Riddle is a Hogwarts professor experimenting with travel between parallel realities. His experiment lands him in the canon universe. linkffn(2595818)

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7452468/1/The-Children-of-Set][The Children of Set]] - (5k+ words ; ONESHOT) Tom travels overseas in search of ancient knowledge. (The writing style and worldbuilding in this fic are heavily inspired by H.P. Lovecraft's works.) linkffn(7452468)

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6939995/1/The-Crown-of-M%C3%A8tis][The Crown of Metis]] - (17k+ words, ONESHOT) In the course of his journeys overseas Voldemort has finally set his eyes on Ravenclaw's Diadem, or as it has become known in Greece, "The Crown of Mètis." linkffn(6939995)

  The year is 1943. The Chamber lies unopened and Grindlewald roams unchecked. Neither Tom Riddle nor Albus Dumbledore is satisfied with the situation. Luckily when Hogwarts is attacked they'll both have other things to worry about.

  When Voldemort died at the Battle of Hogwarts, nothing had prepared him to reawaken as Tom Riddle circa 1943, rid of his madness but left with a gnawing sense of defeat. Things may have gone wrong the first time around, but Tom vowed not to let the course of history run unchanged. He could do better, and this time... no one would stop him.
