Personally, while Rowling wouldn't /hate/ it, I would add heroic Slytherins with no DE ties or blood prejudices -- somebody who is firmly in the 'good is not soft' category.

Something she WOULD hate is my belief that Harry should be a LOT more proactive and badass, though not necessarily OP. He should have also used politics and fame to his advantage.

What do you think?


** For how scary death eaters were portended to be, would it have killed to have someone on the opposite end go punisher on them also during the war. I mean you have muggle born who are getting picked off. I am sure a couple of them would have just said fuck it and gone off the deep end. I am sure if I ever saw my wife getting murdered by a blood supremacist and I didn't have children I would be hunting down every single purebred and just smoking them that I could research that supported a blood supremacist position.

In the Harry Potter world, however, the Death Eaters are essentially domestic terrorist and everyone has a weapon capable of causing great damage, a wand. So the odds are a bit even.

And even in WWII there were plenty of jewish soldiers and people capable of fighting giving the nazis hell wherever they could.

The common civilians didn't have the means or skills to fight back, but that doesn't mean nobody was.

***** *Bielski partisans*

The Bielski partisans were a unit of Jewish partisans who rescued Jews from extermination and fought the German occupiers and their collaborators around Nowogródek (Navahrudak) and Lida (now in western Belarus) in German-occupied Poland. The partisan unit was named after the Bielskis, a family of Polish Jews who organized and led the organization.

The Bielski partisans spent more than two years living in the forest. By the end of the war they numbered as many as 1,236 members, most of which were non-combatants, including children and the elderly.

**** The difference is that world war 2 hadn't happened yet. How were they supposed to know that a bunch of politicians were actually sociopaths and psychopaths. No one in the country really understood the sadism of the Nazi until it was too late for them. A muggleborn isn't going to sit back and let themselves be put in the same situation. They will make an instant connection on what Voldemort is doing and either get out of town, or if someone they loved was murdered plan to either leave or get revenge and some in more of a brutal manner.

It really contributes to a feeling of depth, with so much magic that is either mentioned in passing or that we never see. And literally every year adds at least one extremely rare type of magic, which is why it can feel so natural to come up with your own and build on those in fanfiction.

***** Personally I think most years introduce at least two different kinds of rare magic.

First year was Alchemy, which created the stone but wasn't really touched upon and the Mirror of Erised which seems designed to entrap people with some form of Mind Magic.

Second year was both Hereditary magic(Like parseltongue and later metamorphmagic) and the Basilisk(Which is both an artificial creature designed to destroy armies and seems to be bound to a bloodline, potentially linked to hereditary magic).

Third year was the map, and with it Ward magic, then Time magic, which has interesting laws and consequences and finally Soul magic(Like the Patronus which seems like it was designed to protect the soul).

Fourth year introduces Magical Contracts, as well as the fact that another can force you into one and of course Ritual magic, which seems to be rather interesting.

Fifth year showcases the Department of Mysteries which has several interesting magics held within, including the Brains and the Veil.

Sixth year is Necromancy with the inferi as well as more information on Mind and Soul magics.

Seventh year well yeah, I'll give it the Hallows.

If you're Tolkien, you can have a main character shout "I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor! You cannot pass!

I think the veil has been a source of frustration for people who read it as kids and didn't get what older readers understood as they read that. Which is a legit complaint , just, one I never shared since I read the series as an adult.

*** This is one of my biggest gripes with FF. Always everything has to be explained and happen for a reason. It is so un-life-like.

Humans to this day don‘t know Howe the brain works or why it starts working at all, why we dream or what Dark Matter is. The Veil in my opinion is something like a dark hole. You can see it and tell what to an extent what it does, but you never truly now. We have no true picture of a dark hole, because it literally does not let it escape light as much as none ever does return from the Veil.

My point is; the Veil and a Dark Hole simply are. We know they exist and have limited information on them with many guesses associated with them, but are we close to understanding them? Or will we even ever understand them?

Not explaining the Veil might have been intentional or not, but it put it miles ahead of most fanfiction that cannot accept, that humans know really little and magic will not simply solve that.

Here we have Harry, who's worried that Voldy can get into his head and might make him do shit. And /at no point whatsoever/ does he think to maybe /talk to the one person he knows who has spent extensive periods of time being possessed by Voldemort/.

I know he's briefly called out on the sheer stupidity of this later on, but it still pisses me off.

It's especially annoying because given that the end goal seems to have been apparently for these two to end up together, it would've been a wonderful opportunity to have the two spend some time together, get to know each other better, and build up that relationship...and then dispense with the Chest Monster ridiculousness in the following book(God, that shit was mind-numbingly idiotic).

I agree with most of your comment but I think Rowling made a choice to kill Lupin and Tonks to make a point that war doesn't care who you are. You could die at any time. Now, you could argue the fact that she mentioned their deaths in such a passing manner was sort of lazy, but I understand the decision to kill the two of them. Plus you get the whole "Teddy is an orphan but he'll have people who love him unlike Harry" thing which I'm sure was a nice side effect for her.

***** Right.. the narrative over-all has all these callbacks, going back to the beginning and closing a loop so to speak. Harry sacrificing himself with the power of love to protect his friends, another orphan created by Voldemort. This is a neat writing trick to make everything seem very coherent and meaningful, but it's also what makes the ending seem a little bleak: Everything is returned to the status quo, there's another orphan who's not going to have loving parents, the only thing that's missing is that Harry is killed on an Auror mission and Teddy gets raised by the Malfoys.

A few machine guns and mortars should do the trick. Easily obtainable in countries of the former Warsaw Pact if you are paying in gold. Purebloods hating you for Muggle ancestry? Introduce them to the wonderful inventions of a Muggle named Mikhail Kalashnikov.

Throw some mandrakes into the mix, which, by all logic, should be more devastating than any artillery shell since they are lethal to anyone who hears their cry. So easily a 50 yards kill radius. Seriously, you might as well limit yourself to a volley of these and call it a day.

  God made wizards and God made muggles, but Samuel Colt made them equal.

  Now I know what you're going to say: "But a wizard could just disarm someone with a gun!" Yeah, well they can also disarm someone with a wand (as they do many times throughout the books/movies). But which is faster: saying a spell or pulling a trigger?

  Avada Kedavra, meet Avtomat Kalashnikova.

  Imagine Harry out in the woods, wearing his invisibility cloak, carrying a .50bmg Barrett, turning Deatheaters into pink mist, scratching a lightning bolt into his rifle stock for each kill. I don't think Madam Pomfrey has any spells that can scrape your brains off of the trees and put you back together after something like that. Voldemort's wand may be 13.5 inches with a Phoenix-feather core, but Harry's would be 0.50 inches with a tungsten core. Let's see Voldy wave his at 3,000 feet per second. Better hope you have some Essence of Dittany for that sucking chest wound. I can see it now...Voldemort roaring with evil laughter and boasting to Harry that he can't be killed, since he is protected by seven Horcruxes, only to have Harry give a crooked grin, flick his cigarette butt away, and deliver what would easily be the best one-liner in the entire series: "Well then I guess it's a good thing my 1911 holds 7+1."

  And that is why Harry Potter should have carried a 1911.

Honestly guns vs magic is not an argument that has a clear answer as with even a little bit of creativity, especially with the sheer utility magic brings to the table, standard military tactics vs Death Eaters can be rendered impotent. Remember, especially around the end of the series, you're dealing with teleporting enemies hurling instant-death curses (even if they only clip a finger or hit you through clothing) that can fly and all individually have a lot of combat experience (the inner circle at least, and possibly a fair few of the ones from Voldemort's first war as well).

**** My personal headcannon re: guns is this:

Wizarding clothing should be regularly spelled to be unbreakable, because the unbreakable charm is literally childsplay. You learn it in school. Wizarding clothing should also regularly spelled with the ill-defined "comfort" charms, because wizards love their comfort (and why not?)

This has an interesting side effect of making all wizarding clothing /completely bulletproof./ Unbreakable is almost as poorly defined as the comfort charms, but my take on it is that unbreakable stuff can't be broken by non-magical means -- while an unbreakable glass window can be broken by a charmed rock or a bludgeoning spell, a mundane lightning strike would barely rattle it in it's frame -- making wizarding clothes quite durable unless someone is intentionally trying to cause harm. The comfort charms would magically make sure that the force transmitted by the clothing doesn't exceed comfort tolerances. Sitting on sharp rocks? Who cares! Fall to the ground after a portkey? Doesn't matter. Your clothes will buffer the force.

...

Shot by a bullet? It can't break through the clothes and the comfort charms take care of the impact. Sure, wizards would still be susceptible to being shot in the face, but that's about it. Between hats, robes, gloves, and boots, your average wizard out on the town has barely a square foot of vulnerable surface area. And that's before deliberately trying to defend yourself.

Sure, you can get around this passive defense -- individually enchanting each bullet, for example -- but that's not something a muggle can do and a wizard might have better options that are less easily countered than enchanting bullets.

The Mandrake thing, though... yeah. It should be like poison gas in WWI. Deadly when unprepared, merely awful when you are. There's a lot of potential countermeasures and you just know wizards are reasonably familiar with some of them (even if it's just casting a silencing charm on yourself), but if you manage to surprise them...

Then, he takes out his Yew wand, and kills every single one of the Hogwarts defenders using more of the kind of magic that he used against Albus in their OotP fight.

I believe he actually did. I don't remember if this is Canon or Fanon but I think it was exactly his casual use of the killing curse that made him so feared, because it wasn't a curse people normally used or would use, being so Dark etc. The wikia page for AK even calls it his "signature spell", although without a citation.

You know who else threw around killing curses like candy? Every other Death Eater. Heck, Vincent fucking Crabbe throws a few around in the fight inside the room of Hidden Things, before he goes full retard anyway.

**** The entire protective blanket as a result of the martyr walk is, unfortunately, not done with the same intent as Lily did, believe it or not. It's an incredibly shitty plot device, but the manner in which Lily does it is quite different.

Lily is asked to stand aside to allow Voldemort to kill her son. She's asked to do so twice, but she says, "Take me instead!" She begs Voldemort to spare her son, and take her life instead. Her son's safety is the /only/ intention that she has. Nothing else registers in her mind at that moment in time.

Compare that to Harry being told by Albus and Snape (indirectly) that he has to die for Voldemort to be killed. The martyr walk's intent is mostly towards dying so that the soul shard inside his body can be destroyed, facilitating Voldemort's demise. While Voldemort does make the ultimatum for Harry's surrender for the safety of all defenders, Harry isn't thinking about that too much. He feels a tired resignation and is numbed by the way his life had been manipulated.

Intent is key in all magic.

You can always explain away the non-working of Voldemort's spells on the defenders as a result of him not being the true master of the Elder Wand; that the wishes of the wand's master went against that of the wielder of the wand. The Yew wand would have no such compunctions.

Then the good guys deserved even more buff ups from its quite uselessness in canon. For example, when they luckily got 11 of the 12 Death Eaters down in Book 5, they should have EXECUTED all of them, knowing that the Ministry was completely useless. That would throw off Voldemort's plan by who knows how long.

Or earlier in Year 4, Dumbledore was not that useless plot device and actually bothered to ask fake Moody security questions upon his arrival. Consequently, Barty Jr was captured and pumped full of Veritaserum. They then raided Voldemort's hideout, captured him in his weak homunculus form, killed Nagini, and arrested Wormtail. A task force consisting of Dumbledore, Snape, McGonagall, Flitwick, Kingsley, Tonks, Arthur, and Sirius should easily finish the job. Once Voldemort was in custody, he was pushed through the most extreme form of interrogations, and forced to spill ALL his secrets, ALL his followers, ALL their hideouts, and ALL their resources. Voldemort was then fully obliviated (by Dumbldore's Elderwand), petrified, and locked behind wards stronger than Nurmengard until ALL his Horcruxes had been accounted for.

Or even earlier, after Voldemort got dissed by Harry in 1981, Dumbledore stepped up his game and demanded full Veritaserum and Legilimency interrogations of ALL captured Death Eaters, including Sirius Black. What happened next was that all Lestranges admitted to multiple murders and torture, and was sentenced to Dementor's Kiss immediately. Their vault was confiscated, and the Cup fell into Dumbledore's hand. He and DoM immediately launched the Horcrux Hunt.

You know, if you want to buff up bad guys even more, it doesn't really make sense without doing the same to the good guys. But since canon adult good guys were basically incompetent and useless, even a small buff would have the plot shot, as in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11265467/1/Petrification-Proliferation][Petrification Proliferation]], linkffn(11265467).

So what you need to do is to significantly raise the competence of both sides, completely change the plot, throw away most canon stations after Year 1, and reduce Harry's importance in the first 4 years.

** Get rid of the plot armor.

Snape was a marked death eater, and high up enough that he conversed with Voldemort. And yet he somehow manages to teach children??? We don't have ex cons teach elementary school kids, even if they weren't violent offenders...but Snape was way worse than a car thief. And Minerva and Hagrid liked James, so I don't buy them just ignoring Snape continually trashing a dead man to his kid's face. And I think Harry, when he found out the truth, would realistically hate Snape for having the gall to continue to trash James to his face when he had a role in James's death. Not saying he had to be kind or mourn James, but Snape could have pretended he didn't exist and ignored Harry rather than acting like James's bullying was worse than Severus actually being one of the reasons he was killed and his kid was orphaned. And Snape did have a role, he feels guilty about Lily's death and Lily dies alongside with James.

Harry is an average student. There's no way he is battling with death eaters and surviving. I would have Harry be a great student, not overpowered but top of the class, but that would ruin J.K.'s whole bit the average person is capable of anything.

Ron and Hermoine and Harry and Ginny getting married. It's a little too cliche, and it doesn't even fit into the cultural norms. In the 70s, sure it probably wasn't that unusual to get married at 20 to your high school sweetheart. in the 90s, it was. I could still see Hermione and Ron married, but they wouldn't have kids for a while and I would have Harry end up with either a random student or Luna or even Cho. Ginny would pursue her quidditch dreams. In canon, she would have quit her pro sports job and had a kid while she was only 23 or 24....

Some Slytheirns that weren't death eaters or blood purists. Could have Daphne or Blaise make fun of Pansy or Draco for using slurs and saying "my father" all the time, or there could be some well developed Slytherins who are original characters.

Seriously, someone please tell me what Dumbledore's little army and the Aurors did to not just react, but combat the mass murderer attacking them? They should've been gathering intelligence to go on raids, cut off whatever sources that are funding their operations, laying traps for spies and etc. They were at war and somehow the death eaters were the only ones fighting it :/

But: Not all Slytherins hate Muggleborns/Squibs/Werewolves/Creatures et cetra. Maybe even some of the Slytherins help out when Snape and Carrow are in charge; that'd be the biggest thing I'd change.

I'd also change the Harry is a Horcrux nonsense, as I feel like that's a bit overkill. (Personally anyway).

The professors have more of a backbone. McGonagall actually checking in on Harry, arguing with Dumbledore about some of his choices, the other Heads of Houses having some sort of importance, et cetra.

Parseltongue being used more than it was in canon. I mean Harry is often accused of being the next "Dark lord in Training" He "hates Muggleborns" despite the fact that his mother was a Muggleborn and one of his friends is a Muggleborn and stuff like that, maybe Rowling could have done something with Parseltongue that would have helped others show that not everyone who uses it is evil.

Introducing Harry to role models early; like first year early. Maybe Dumbledore or McGonagall writes to Remus asking if he wants to meet Harry, maybe they have Andromeda, Nymphadora and Ted Tonks meet Harry and get to know him, or just someone. (I mean Nymphadora at least is in the dang Order; and yeah I know that people thought that Sirius betrayed James and Lily, killed Pettigrew and killed 12 Muggles; but you'd think that Dumbledore or McGonagall would ask Andromeda or Nymphadora to get to know Harry.

Someone, freaking someone realize that how Harry behaves isn't exactly normal; or the way he dresses isn't normal, and get him the hell out of the Dursley's house, I know why Rowling did it, but I still don't like it.

Have Harry actually use the dang two way mirror, he's so worried about Sirius that he forgets about the mirror? I can see him being worried, but he'd just forget the dang mirror? Come on, that one really made me want to do a facepalm.

** The absolute lack of mention of the Soviets in the lore about Grindelwald and the likes.

Litteraly the most important block that led to the defeat of the Nazis in WWII doesn't even get the most minor mention anywhere.

I can understand somebody not liking the Soviet Union and portraying it either inaccurately or in a deceptive way because of their biases.

I also can understand that the published may not have liked going into that path, but I find it an absolutely gigantic historical inaccuracy at the very least.

LOL

well, okay, you're not wrong, but it struck me as hilarious that this was the thing that got stuck in your craw.

To be fair, I've got my own version of that - atomic bombs. Surely someone outside the inbred bullshit of Wizarding Britain noticed the whole A-bomb thing. Does Japan have no magicals? Couldn't the magicals have infiltrated the Manhattan Project and simply made it fail?

If you're going to build a world with basically "magic can do anything" and posit that magicals have been secretly living around us, Obliviating the shit out of us willy-nilly for the past 500 years, treating us like cattle, then surely SOMEONE would've noticed when the cattle invented atomic bombs.

Really from the Statute of Secrecy on forward, we should be living in an alternative history version of earth.

What would've been awesome is revealing tiny clues in the first book or two and slowly expanding it as you go on, to follow Harry's increasing awareness of the history of his own world. We slowly learn that Earth-Muggle is not Earth-Prime.

I understand that the story is extremely centered on Britain and there isn't much sense to explore the international scene, but it feels strange, if you mention/involve Nazi Germany it makes sense to at least mention their main opponent.

** I think a story of where blood purity does matter would be both incredibly fascinating and controversial. Where pureblood live for centuries looking 25, where their body is simply stronger, and other misc. ideas. Like a pureblood is to a muggleborn what a human is to an elf in LotR.

The conflict would be essentially no different from reality. *Humans are not equal.* That is just the nature of reality where men are physically stronger than women for example.*We just have to pretend we are equal and treat everyone equally.*

** I would get rid of Voldemort and other outright evil antagonists. Remove the looming threat (with an obvious solution) and problematic prophecies.

Tom Riddle could be the leader of a pureblood reform group that was responsible for Harry's parents' deaths and nearly Harry's, but then he repented and disbanded his followers. Years later, the former not-death-eaters disagree on whether they went too far or not far enough.

Harry would grow up with family who are decent, but he would keep the feeling of never quite fitting in. Maybe, lean harder on the mystical side of magic, with him meditating or sensing hidden things or talking to trees.

Either cut out the boarding school too or have a proper subplot about losing touch with the normal world.

Harry still gets to navigate magical mishaps and new friendships and esoteric politics and magical philosophy and the differences of reality from what his family told him. Just no Voldemort.

But no. Because Rowling simply doesn't think that was important. She just TELLS us how great and powerful a wizard Harry is.

** Yeah, I kind of agree that Harry could have used his fame to his advantage - naturally, however, she wanted to take the route where he was purely good.

I think that's something I'd want to change - she made things too black and white; it was unrealistic. She should have made some muggleborns total assholes, and she should have made good Slytherins that were literally just good, not "an asshole who happens to be playing the Death Eaters" good or "someone who very reluctantly gave up what a Horcrux is" good or "a family who changed sides in the war because they saw they were losing" good. Slytherins are pretty realistic people - I think most would change sides in /anything/ if they saw they were losing. When people see a fight happening, a lot of our first instincts are just "should I even get involved?" not "time to fight". People are naturally self-interested, and that's okay. It doesn't make them bad, as long as they leave some room to care about others too.

I'd also want to change the dumb duelling system, oh my god. Why is it that there are so many cool spells but all duels consist of Expelliarmous and Avada Kedavra?? How is Harry supposed to be this master of DADA if I can count all the spells he can do on two hands? I don't think she'd hate this, but damn, she was determined to make the magic system as simplistic as possible. I also don't buy that Harry is the best at DADA. Show, don't tell. Hermione says he is, but as far as I can see, Hermione was much better at fending things off than he was. You can't just make a character the best at the one subject he needs to master. Make him struggle for it.

And wtf were all those deus ex machinas. They have magic that defies physics. They shouldn't need them. They should be intelligent. She should have realized that intelligence isn't "Hermione got O's on all her OWLs". It's "let's make a plan to outwit the enemy". And Voldemort should not have been that dumb either, let's be real. He always just?? Waited until the end of the year?? And only used the Killing Curse?? If people are so powerful and intelligent, they must realize how much more useful other spells/strategies are, no matter how violent their disposition is.

** Not sure if it counts as positive, but I think she should've kept with her original plan of having Arthur die from Nagini's bite. Whether she still offs Sirius as well doesn't matter to me so much, but I think we would've seen a lot more development on Ron's end had she gone through with that. I haven't seen any fics with this premise, or even this happening as a small event, but one has to wonder how it would have influenced the different characters' growth. For example, Ron would've ended up maturing a little after he grieved and Harry would've been guilt-stricken about not being able to do anything fast enough (alongside the guilt over Sirius). A little change, seeing as overall I don't recall Arthur doing anything of major importance after that, but it would have had an impact for sure

However, seeing as how Canon went the way it did, I would only have to assume that Rowling disliked how dark of a route that would take everything and therefore would not approve of the decision nowadays
