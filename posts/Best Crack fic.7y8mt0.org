Beside Itachi is a that a baby of anything written by Roscharch's Blot (which I love), what are some humorous HP fics?


** The best is no doubt Seventh Horcrux, but there are a lot of good ones :

linkffn(A black comedy; Where in the world is Harry Potter?; Oh god not again; When in doubt, Obliviate; Harry Potter and the Champion's Champion; Dear Order; Harry the Hufflepuff; Inspected by No 13; The Inner Eye of Harry Potter; Dimension Hopping for Beginners; The Horror! The Horror!; Just a Random Tuesday; Sphere of Influence; In the mind of a scientist; Gryffindors Never die; Messing with Time; Whatever Happened to Bromance; The Many Harry Potters of Little Hangleton; How Lucius Malfoy Accidentally Destroyed the World; On a Train, Switching Tracks; All the Dementors of Azkaban; A bad week at the Wizengamot; What would broz do; Scorpius Malfoy and the Improbable Plot; Escapologist Harry)

and other fics by nonjon and BajaB are great humor and crack fics.

** Humorous fics aren't the same thing as crackfics. Sitting on the fence are linkffn(Seventh Horcrux) and linkffn(Like a Red-Headed Stepchild).

Firmly in the crack category, there's linkffn(The Many Harry Potters of Little Hangleton). Also see the apparently-abandoned but fun linkffn(Harry Potter and the Slightly Suggestive Handshake). linkffn(Honestly, Harry!) is also pretty funny.

May I also drop a link to my own "humor-but-not-crack" story, linkffn(The Parselmouth of Gryffindor)? (Note: the first two chapters are setting things up and aren't as humorous as the rest, so please bear with it for that long...)

**** A crackfic is a story solely meant to get a quick laugh. Inconsistencies and OOC are legion, nonensical or referential humor is the norm. The idea behind the name is a story written "on crack" (e.g. while under the influence of a hallucinogenetic drug).
