I'm looking for good fanfiction that are marked as complete in the whole story. I don't mind humour and crack fics done seriously but actual crack fics tend to annoy me... I've also have a number of heart breaks due to good fice that ends up being dead or fics that were deleted by the writer since they can't finish it or something.... so I want fics that has closure, that's actually complete. Not that fond of draco so I'll probably won't read anything that has Draco as main love interest or protagonist, but if it's really good I don't mind trying. Just not HPxDM.

A list of excluded from this list

Those who aren't technically complete (this meant that if there is a sequel, the sequel needs to be completed as well as all subsequent books after and not just the first "book")

Books that are marked complete since it was adopted by someone but isn't finished by the one who took it in.

Stories that are a series of one-shots.

Fics that are marked as complete but is actually just dead or for some reason the writer marked it as such but isn't.

#+begin_quote
  What if Voldemort went after Harry and Neville, and gave no one a chance to die for them? What if both Chosen Ones died as children?--There was no prophesied boy, but there was still this--dozens of shadowed young faces refusing to run, even at the very end of the world. Dumbledore looked out at his chess pieces, pawns and queens; his children and his friends; his collateral damage. He had the beginnings of a plan swelling in his chest. It would take them decades to get their hands, quietly, on every Horcrux. Tom Riddle had to think they were secret. He had to think he was safe. It would take them almost decades, but one day he would be mortal again. These dozens of faces--they were mortal now. Alastor Moody could feel mortality in the aches of old broken bones; Andromeda rewrote her own last name. Remus and Sirius felt empty, gaping holes in the seats around them, and they made crude, expansive, joyous toasts to friends' memories. When Molly first reached over and held Arthur's hand, they knew this was something that could not last. That was why they held hands, held on, held tight.

  Slytherin House isn't what it used to be. There are barely enough children to fill a classroom, let alone a House Table, and the Quidditch captain is a muggle-born fourth year. For a new generation starting at Hogwarts as the war drifts into memory, there's far more to learn about the four Houses than they could ever have imagined (prequel to Snake Bites).

  COMPLETE. When Regulus is five, he nearly drowns in the sea off Blackpool. When Regulus is eleven, his brother befriends a ghost. It's not until Regulus is eighteen and ready to die that the Black family's darkest secret finally unravels. It might, perhaps, change everything. (A coming-of-age story with mind magic, star charting, pink petit-fours, two diaries, and a ghost.)
