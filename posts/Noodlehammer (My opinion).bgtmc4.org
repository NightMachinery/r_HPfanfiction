As a writer he writes well in my view but I think his opinion seeps deeply into his work. To be honest, I personally consider him the fanfic equivalent of Howard Philips Lovecraft, fairly good writing peppered with a lot of questionable views.

What are your thoughts?

Edit: I'm looking for a proper discussion not a downvote bombing by people who can't be bothered to engage in discussion


** I think his writing is fairly good as well, and the fic we are all thinking about started (in my personal opinion) quite good. I think the real issue isnt even that he cant separate his own views from his work, its the deliberately aggressive and heavy handed manner he inserts them in his work that is the issue. I also had the impression that most of that insertion was made out of childish spite. The reviews starting calling him out on how the increasingly long smut scenes started taking over the plot and added nothing. Instead of taking it as constructive criticism, he went on a rampage about how readers are prudes who cant handle sex, and he kept increasing the smut to just spite us. And the same happened later on with the xenophobia/racism/whatever. Its not that an author cant create a racist asshole as a protagonist, is that his work just feel like a rant, rather than actual narrative.

Overall, I am sorry that he purposefully screwed up an otherwise good fanfic.

**** He also tries to hide it as "oh no, Harry hates ALL religions!", but for /some/ odd reason Islam is the only religion that gets those long, insane, rambling walls of text about how evil and subhuman its adherents are.

** I feel it gets more hate than it deserves. It has... questionable views, but it makes sense. The biggest gripe people have talked about to me what the dislike of Muslims. In the context of the story, it makes sense for Harry to be speaking ill of religion. A harem? That isn't anything too horrible to complain about. Poor characters? That isn't something out of the norm. Bad cliches? Welcome to Fanfiction.

I feel it got a similar treatment that Fortnite and Twilight did. Something got big and popular and a small minority rebelled against that which made the dislike of it more popular where legitimate criticisms gave birth to illegitimate ones.

I'm happy to go ahead and dislike the story if people can show why I should, but I haven't been brought forth any reasons for why it is deserving of so much hate.

*** Can't say why some people /hate/ it, but you gave reasons to dislike the story yourself :

- Harem
- Poor characters
- Full of bad cliches

Every one of them would be bad by themselves, but put all of them together and you have what most people would call a bad fic. This in itself would be enough to dislike the story. The whole drama about disliking muslims is just the icing on the cake.

​

PS : I don't think it is a good idea to "truly" talk about religion in a Harry Potter fic. Christians are a little of an exception because you can link them to the Witch Burning or put Harry in a Religiously Fanatic environment if you want to make him Anti-Muggles, but any another religions (especially Muslims) would probably sound too political and look like the Author is using his fic to push his views (which is one of the things Noodlehammer is accused if I remember well).

**** It depends. When I review a story, I have two scales: critical and personal. My favorite series of all time is easily a 9/10 in enjoyment. It gets a 6/10 on a critical scale on a good day.

The way the story used harems, character development, and cliches doesn't make the enjoyment of it bad. It is a guilty pleasure of mine to read about harems occasionally.

As for religion, yes and no. It probably isn't the best plan for gaining a loyal audience, but I wouldn't call it a negative on the critical scale. I would also say that Islam has a pretty open spot in any story involving magic as there are regions in the world where witches are being stoned.

It doesn't take much work to find a way for any religion much less Islam to make its way into the story. That includes wizards in isolated tribes being held as demi-gods or as blessed. I don't personally enjoy seeing religion given my views of it, but that doesn't mean the concept can't be very interesting to see.

P.S. Technically all Marvel crossovers are religious too as they include Norse Gods.

***** I admit I would not know about crossover since I do not read them (though with Marvel, at least with the Cinematic Universe, they may be held by god but are, in the end just aliens with higher level of technology).

I understand this double standards scale. But when I say that Harem is bad, it's moer about the fact that 99% of Harem end up in what I would call bad writing where the girls end up as totally bland character only good to agree with the hero or share his bed for a smut scene once her character arc is over (usually the moment she joins the harem).

From what I see some people still like this kind of story with a "guilty pleasure" reading, but in my case it turns to be boring. It's a bit as with another popular cliche, the Lord Potter trope. It's a cliche but it may turn to be interesting, it's just that after the 15th time of :\\
Harry goes to Gringott,\\
Harry finds his parents will (which would exonerate Sirius but was sealed by evil Dumbledore to force him to go to the Dursleys)\\
Harry becomes rich because Potter are like the 2nd richest family in Brittain after the Black (and he is the heir of Black)\\
Harry becomes the most powerful man in Brittain becomes the alliances his grandfather had are still actives\\
11-15 years after his death, and all these political dragons are all ready to listen and follow every world from a child often as old as their children or grandchildren\\
Harry officially breaks out of Dumbledore control and will yell at him and call him old goot every time they meet after this.\\
Harry decides to do some musculation (officially because it's supposed to help in a Magical duel, but truly because author wants the girls to drool on his perfect 6 pack during smut scenes)\\
Every girl in the castle is now incredibly attracted to Harry (which does not make them swallow at all), and their sheer number make most of the male resident very unhappy, and will probably force the next generation to do some Habsbourg (or Gaunt) level of incest just to not die out.\\
Harry should, with all his new powers, be able to destroy Voldemort in 3 days, but won't because reasons (and author wrote himself in a corner where story should end but he didn't finish to build harem so he won't).\\
Let's just say that I don't even want to bother anymore with hope that this one would somehow be different than the previous one.

So yeah, cliches are disliked mainly because most of the time, they are either bad writing or acceptable one but that are so close to all the previous one that you are not even sure of what story you are reading anymore. And we were talking about Noodlehammer who, in my humble opinion, does not use these cliche in an interesting way.

****** Thor has a hammer that causes lightning to fall down and can shoot lightning from his fingers. Even if that is all advanced technology, it functions just like magic. Magic, chakra, spirits, mana, ki, qi, chi, and everything else is considered to be "Magic" because its function to the story is identical.

Further, I don't see why you need magic to be a god really. All human gods are magical to my knowledge. A miracle and blessing are just another way of saying magic. Also, I would consider a person of power in a K2 or K3 civilization to be a god due to the sheer power they control.

As [[/u/Lord_Anarchy]] pointed out, that author and his stories get shat on so often around here that a corresponding drinking game would make you a regular at the ICU.

  fairly good writing peppered with a lot of questionable views.
#+end_quote

There are three different answers to that:

1) You don't care about the author but judge them solely for their work

2) You hate the author and their works for who they are

3) You embrace the reactionary nature of his work compared to the modern mainstream

Honestly, I fall firmly into the first camp. I don't give a sinlge fuck about the author or his works. It is not good IMO, but far, far from the worst fanfic has to offer. Because, at least in my opinion, anti-Islamic rants are nowhere near as bad as child-rape smut. Therefore I honestly don't get what the fuss is all about. Kinda like comparing about a neighbour's barbeque while a fuel depot is exploding in the background.

*** I feel like it ruins the story for a lot of people. Even when I try to isolate my political views from reading the work, like I do with Lovecraft, his massive wall-of-text rants actually detract from the story in a meaningful way. For Lovecraft, the racism informs the work, obviously, but it's not like he interrupted Call of Cthulhu with a two-page argument for why Jews shouldn't be allowed in Harvard, or something.

Noodlehammer turns what would otherwise be an interesting scene (e.g. Harry and co. arriving in Egypt) into a dull slog through a mountain of angry exposition, it totally breaks the flow and immersion.

** I am not a big fan, partly because he use some trope I dislike a lot such as harem (I dream of a day where I could see a harem with several, well fleshed character that have their own goals and interaction with each other, not just a bunch of beautiful girl who turn into mindless s*x toy the day they join the harem).

But my main problem is how he much you can see his own opinions into his work. As a general rule, I hate it when a fiction work use the story to push an opinion, usually with the subtility of a sledgehammer. I disliked it when Superman was explaining children how to be a good Americans, and I hate it now when he character go into a anti islamic rant.\\
Also, the fact that the base universe (Harry Potter) has not direct link with the subject (here the Islam) make it worse because it twist the character to bring the subject.

** I think [[/u/DragonEmperor1997]] got it right on the nose. I tried reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11669575/1/For-Love-of-Magic][For Love of Magic]], I really really did. The pros with the story were obvious: unique plot line and characters, not overwhelmed with grammatical or spelling errors, easy to read and get what he is trying to say, not to bad on bashing. That's why I tried so hard to read it (36/56 chapters). A good, well written, and interesting Harry!Grey fic can be hard to find.

I think the problem with his writing (based on reading what I did of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11669575/1/For-Love-of-Magic][For Love of Magic]]) is that he seemingly forces in a bunch of stuff that a majority of readers aren't a fan of. Harems, under aged sex, seemingly irrelevant and time consuming sex scenes that (in my humble opinion) honestly weren't great away, Noodlehammer seeming to intentionally go out of his way to piss off the reader, and not to mention that Harry himself as a character is kind of a Gary Sue for dicky, I know everything, 'evolved past monogomy' characters.

He is a decent writer, I suppose, if you are of the exact same beliefs of him. I try to be really, really open minded but it just came to be too much. I don't know the guy, though he does consider Harry in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11669575/1/For-Love-of-Magic][For Love of Magic]] to be a "fair reflection" of himself and that doesn't sound like a good thing to me, so I don't put any stock into thinking if he is a good or bad person. That said, I'm not going to bother reading any of his other stories and I'm certainly not going to recommend them. (His writing is actually why I know how to /un/favorite a fanfiction story.)

One last note: I get that as a writer we write whatever the hell we want to write. That said, I think it's beyond weird how he reacts to constructive criticism.

** My opinion, He's a decent writer, but I think he just needs to learn to that once he's got his major plot points out of the way, he needs to just finish off the bad guy and polish off the story at a sensible point rather than drag it out continually with needless one step-forward, two steps back bad guy power ups and mc suffering.

I've read about 85% of Reaching for a Dream, 90% of For Love of Magic and enjoyed them both for the majority but just never finished them because I got bored of the ending arcs dragging out.

No actual comments on the anti-islam stuff as I quit reading before that came up.

I'm happily reading A Discordant Note now and will continue to do so while it keeps me entertained.

** I love Noodlehammer. He's in my top 3 fanfic authors, and that's because I love the way he writes, the callbacks the comedic set ups, etc. Interactions between Sirius and Harry were my favorite. I also don't mind an overpowered Harry so long as he isn't how Robst writes him (dull, no conflict, nothing to look forward to, that's his peak). The harem trope usually DOES bother me, but he's very self-aware on the topic, and honestly if I don't like it, I just don't read it. For his views on Islam and the rants and stuff, I still don't mind because when you look at it from Harry's perspective, it falls right into character. Plus, I genuinely love his writing and can't WAIT for him to update
