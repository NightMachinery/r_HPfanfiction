I find it weird that Katie Bell/Harry is such a popular pairing yet there are almost no fics including it. Many people in this subreddit really like the pairing and often times ask for whatever scraps we can get but no one has really stepped up to the plate to write one. Why is that?

(Also if you guys have any fics with this pairing. I'm like a crack hoe who's going through withdrawals)


** Because it's not easy to write her in a fashion which does not come across as character X with a different name. If you make her academic, she will come across as a sporty Hermione, if you make her a tad mean and fighty, she'll be Ginny 2.0. If you make her a pureblood princess, that's Daphne or maybe Susan. A big family will seem like discount Weasleys and so on.

I'm working on something with her in, but that's basically "hilarious events from my school days" transferred to the HP universe (and made British).

***** On the spot! I wasn't critiquing you but the fan base. And it was more of an observation.

That being said I'll give it an old college try:

Canon traits (according to wiki):

Sporty\\
Kind\\
Friendly\\
Brave\\
Determined

To avoid making her out to be a Hermione, Ginny or Daphne I first propose that she's a halfblood with an interest in the muggle world. Something silly, like video games. Also, play on her competitive edge from sports. Make her interested in dueling as well. Have her get good grades in the subjects shes interested in.

Second, I'd base her character on the elder sister archtype:

[[https://www.the-exponent.com/sister-archetypes/]]

New traits:

Understanding\\
Nurturing\\
Slow to anger\\
Resilient\\
Interested in selfimprovement and challenging herself

I'd also want to base her character on the "cool" older sister. So fun loving and willing to crack jokes. Perhaps have her take on some of the mischeviousness of the Weasley twins. You can make her fun loving in other ways but people seem to love the weasleys, so w/e its easier to have have her hang out with them and be influenced. This part of her personality though needs to be subservient to the older sister archtype though. But its like the cool older sister that gets your beer for high school parties.

But since she's sporty and shown to be brave you also need to show a more /risky/ side of her. Perhaps give her a vice like making her a bit of a pervert.

Give her a younger brother, but make him 5 years younger.

Play on these these traits and I think you'll have a distinct, relateable, and interesting girlfriend material within the confines of canon.

*** That comes down to the author involved, unfortunately. I'm gonna sound like an ass, but most people who write fanfic aren't that invested in the technical/craft aspects of it e.g. character creation, and it shows.

It's why, say, Daphne Greengrass is a Clone in almost every fic involving her.

I highly recommend reading books by Nancy Kress: They're amazing when it comes to understanding the craft.

Right, but there had to be one fic that started her off that way (Jeconais?) and then people loved it and followed. Additionally, good, pureblood Slytherin was a character type that fanfiction was looking for (using Blaise until he was confirmed as a guy and Daphne took over), but I haven't really seen a unique character niche that people are clamoring for and hasn't been written, only that they want to see Katie, which goes back to Hellstrike's point. It's hard to establish a unique and engaging personality for Katie that hasn't already had it's niche carved out. But it only takes one, which I agree is kind of weird. You'd think somebody would've figured it out by now (be the change you wanna see in the world!), and then people will copy it and adapt it and the ship will sail.

***** Yeah, short of "female friend with a perverted sense of humour", I can't really think of an archtype which isn't already covered by a canon or fanon character, and even that is hardly enough to define a character. Well, that or "bigger sister", but that's a little contraproductive when you want to ship them.

Ginny has most sporty roles covered, Hermione the academic side. Daphne and Susan do the aristocratic aspects, cheerleaders and such aren't really a thing in a Hogwarts setting (or UK in general). Party girl is still open (which is what I'm currently writing), but I can already smell the slut shaming reviews coming from that.

I mean, you can make Katie a train nerd, a plane enthusiast, a car person and such, but again that hardly fits the setting.

This I don't get, Katie has more "sports" scenes than Ginny, who wasn't really in book 1, was a wallflower in book 2, i dont think is even mentioned in book 3, has no major part in book 4(apparently turned on Harry with everyone else(it seems that way at least, though I'm sure there were others, besides Hermione, who didn't...) and went to the ball with Neville... It's not till book 5 that she plays, where as Katie played in 1-3 and in 5. It's also when she starts dating around.

It's not till book 6 that i can kind of see her as "sporty" but even then....

I'm just saying a pre-HBP Katie could easily be the sporty girl that Harry is attracted to w/o it feeling like Ginny 2.0... and since i dont really like Ginny i'd prefer it to be honest

******* Katie might have more sports scenes, but given how much of the HBP romance arc was centred around Ginny and Quidditch, she is the canon "sports romance". Especially since Rowling used Quidditch to depict Ginny as interesting.

That is not to say that you can't use Quidditch in a fic with any other character, but you should avoid the "she plays quidditch = hot". Perhaps go down the "shared experiences/shared time to build a connection" road or "the two newcomers to the team" instead.

****** Even then, I feel like people have shoved Luna into that archetype, usually as the secret pervert or just super blasé about sex. So maybe not specifically perverted humor, now that I think about it, but probably not meaningfully distinct enough to be useful.

I guess it's true in fics where Katie is a side character, she often does give that teasing vibe- along with the other chasers- who are kinda flirty with Harry to mess with him or joke about his crushes.

****** I didn't get a notification. Sorry for the late reply. I made my post quickly. I create characters from time to time and I realize that I mixed up traits, quirks and values etc. It's all over the place. The video games and perverted jokes are just minor quirks of the character. Like with Ron, and the uranus joke and the Chudley cannons, now that I think about it. The quirks are just there to make her more relatable.

When I say "older sister", I meant that she is more mature and level headed. She is a year older and that is tangible. Play on it. Yes, I am suggesting to make a (more mature) easy-going "best friend" type girlfriend with a fun loving side. Slow to anger but will back you up when push comes to shove.

Hermione, Ginny and Daphne all are portrayed as very aggressive imo, you get a more passive figure in Susan, but being passive does not mean the same as shy. It can mean picking your battles and having a thick skin. A certain strength of heart and resilience. These are all traits that can complement Harry, and are really the heart of what I want to see.

**** There is only a limited amount of ways you can write any character without running into a "that's just character X with a different name" situation. However, with Katie, there is the added difficulty that she is rather constrained by the situation and large amount of other "Hogwarts girls". If you write a partner that is not constrained by Hogwarts (eg Tonks, Fleur, a Durmstrang OC), you have a lot more freedom without running into an established character which is similar to what you are writing.

***** "that's just character X with a different name" would not be a problem if you properly develop Katies character in your Fanfic. Since so little is known about Katies backstory you have complete freedom writing her character without imitating anyone else.

You could go all-in on Quidditch with parents who are extremely competitive and put a lot of pressure on Katie.

You could give her an abusive home life either by a magical family or a muggle parent after her wizard parent died (assuming she is a half-blood). This would not be the most creative back story, but Harrys ships most of the time have a rather happy home life.

And basically everything else, and I think that this is exactly the problem why there are so few fanfictions with Katie in a major role. You have to invent the character traits that make her interesting, which takes a lot of time. Copy-pasting your basic standard pairing into the story is much more convenient.

Her character as pairing also has no potential for cheap conflict. The reason WBWL stories are so popular for authors is because you get conflict without working for it.

In the end, there are a lot of ways to make Katie stand out from your standard pairings you just have to take the time to develop her character.

True, but unlike other notable basically OCs, what we /do/ know about her isn't really enough to stand out. With Daphne you get Slytherin enemies-to-lovers and pureblood politics, with Susan you get ministry insider stuff because of her aunt. Gryffindor and Quidditch doesn't exactly jump off the page in terms of unique inspiration. My first thought would be to basically make her a combination of Tonks and Ginny, older sisterish, Quidditch, maybe some trauma from her attack, so it's not impossible, but probably fairly niche, and I'm guessing people may not feel that it's worth the effort.

********* I like the fact that Katie doesn't stand out so much. She's not involved in blood purity (other than being targeted for being a Muggleborn). She's not involved in the Ministry. She's never really Harry's enemy.

She could just be a good friend as Harry goes through the canon and she can offer advice and help him out and give him a bit of a life outside Ron and Hermione. There are a lot of ways to involve her in Harry's life, even outside of Quidditch.

- She could be written as a cat lover (or a rat lover), meaning that she sides with either Hermione or Ron during the Scabbers mess in PoA.\\
- She could help Harry do research for the Triwizard tasks because of course she doesn't believe he put his name in himself. Her, Angelina, Alicia, and the Weasley Twins could be great help to Harry during the tournament.\\
- Katie could be good at knitting and therefore helps Hermione learn when Hermione is going on about SPEW. It would be interesting to see Katie just as shocked about house-elf slavery as Hermione is, but they disagree on how to go about changing it.
- She could be very smitten with Cedric and when she finds out that he's interested in Cho, she could be very upset about it. If she and Harry are close enough friends by then, she could confide in him. Then he could possibly take her to the Yule Ball, where they realize they have feelings for each other.\\
- During the summer before OotP she could be someone that he can write to during the summer and she can give him what news she has.\\
- During OotP she could recruit Harry into helping her and Angelina choose new Quidditch team members. After Harry gets himself banned from Quidditch, there's room for her to be pissed at him, but then eventually forgive him and possible give him broomstick rides on her broom out where Umbridge can't see them. They could be officially dating right now and it be a good time to have them overcome difficulties in their relationship.\\
- Obviously in HBP she has the thing with the necklace, which would provide Harry extra motivation to prove that it was Malfoy.

Plus there's plenty of things that Harry helps her with outside Harry's own life. Helping her study. Perhaps she has a hobby that Harry shows interest in. Perhaps she invites Harry over to her house during the holidays and they have fun with Muggle entertainment with Angelina, Lee, Alicia, Fred, and George. I can imagine the lot of them going to the cinema and having far too much fun. Heck, they could go tenpin bowling and make jokes about Dumbledore the entire time.

There's a lot you can do with Katie. And it's not that you can't do any of this with other characters. But I find her very intriguing and so I would love to read or write fics that involve her and Harry.

This is fanfiction though, you can make Katie an ice mage, make her mother a death eater, do whatever! However, when looking at why there aren't many Harry/Katie fics I stand by the reason being that she isn't unusual/different in canon.

And yeah, she would be better than Ginny. Anyone would be better than Ginny. I'll never quite understand what Harry I-Hate-My-Fans Potter saw in his biggest and moat persistent fangirl.

** There's Paging Dr Bell by zArkham, to which I can't link because of the rules.

It has a lot of good ideas in it, along with some rather iffy scenes hence me not being able to link it. It's not a pairing story per se, but the two are the main protagonists of the Hogwarts scenes and certainly have a developing relationship.

  Harry Potter is not the Wizard people expected him to be. He has traversed the dark, and it is down to those around him to bring him into the light. He has suffered, but because of it, he will become strong.

*** i've never seen her as popular in fanfic, but she's relatively popular in the books as a person. she is on the quidditch team with harry and i believe is in Fred and George's year, but it'd be easy to make her a year younger or older.

**** She's on the team in sixth year which makes are o ly a year older than harry, so a year below the twins. It also means that the game against slytherin in Harry's first tear was also her first game on the team aswell
