** I think Arthur should go by himself and be the one to have a checkup. Your original idea is funny, but it looks too much like he uses his children as Guinea pigs, which I don't see him doing. Not if they're not voluntary and he doesn't want to experiment himself. I feel like Arthur would want to be the one having a checkup so that way he can experiment firsthand.

** /CRACK!/ "Blimey, Arthur! Y'alright there? I knew I left them rock cakes in the oven too long!" Hagrid looked over at Arthur Weasley in concern as he sat hunched over Hagrid's table with a hand clasped over his jaw. "Arthur..." Hagrid extended a concerned hand.

Mr Weasley straightened up with a manic, if slightly pained, smile. Hagrid recoiled in shock.

"Hagrid, this is brilliant!"

"Uh... If you say so..."

"Don't you see! Now I have the perfect excuse to go and see Hermione's parents!"

"Aren't they still in Australia." Hagrid frowned. "Last I heard, they were still... Y'know. Bad business, that. Still - can't blame Hermione for wanting to keep her family safe..." He trailed off, thinking of his own father and of the long hours of rehabilitation that Grawp had gone through after the Battle of Hogwarts.

"Don't you see, Hagrid! They're /dentists!/"

"Not followin' you Arthur..."

"Tooth healers! I have a broken tooth! It needs healing! This is fantastic!" Without another word, Arthur swept out of Hagrid's hut - leaving Hagrid himself to shake his head in dismay.

Hermione hadn't spoken for days after she'd returned from Perth. Hollow-eyed, and dejected she drifted about the Burrow as Ron did his best to comfort her. Books would be picked up and set aside again, and she would sigh into the cups of tea he kept bringing her. What really broke Arthur's heart, though, was when the sighs turned to sobs. Night after night she wept into his son's shoulder. Hermione hadn't been able to undo the obliviation. It had been cast too well, too perfectly, by the brightest witch of her age.

It was all too much for Arthur. He wouldn't stand by whilst another one of his children suffered. Not after Fred. He might not be as academically-inclined as his daughter in all but blood, but he /knew/ how things worked. You have to make anything muggle compatible with magic. All he needed was an opening...

He knocked on the door of 12 Grimmauld Place with urgency. Harry opened the door and received him with a smile.

"Harry, this isn't a social call." Arthur said urgently. "I need your help."

"Name it." Harry's eyes took on a steely quality. "Tell me what you need."

"It's for Hermione, not me."

"Name it," he repeated as his gaze never wavered.

"First, I need you to help me dress as much like a wizard failing to look muggle as possible. Not robes, though. I don't need the Antipodean Association of Magic Wielders after me."

"Right... What else?"

"I need you and your considerable clout to secure an international portkey..."

Arthur watched as everything fell into place and his seventh son understood. Harry smiled in an alarmingly feral manner which made Arthur think of Sirius Black for the first time in years.

--------------

"Stop complaining Dad, that tooth needs looking at!" Harry exclaimed loudly in the waiting room for Wilkes & Wilkes Dental Clinic.

Arthur made a point of grumbling theatrically about "muggle healers" as Dr Monica Wilkie lead him into the examination room. She started gratifyingly.

"So, what can I do for you today Mr... Weasley? Now that's an unusual name." She silently took his unusual clothes in too. Squinting as though it reminded her of something that she couldn't quite recall...

"Really? There are quite a few of them in my part of the world, although most of them are my children."

Dr Wilkie chuckled obligingly: "Have many, do you?"

"Oh, between seven and nine on a good day."

""Between"" she repeated in a sceptical tone that Arthur had heard Hermione use many times.

"Well, we've sort of adopted two of my son's friends from his boarding school."

"Ah. Hm. Well, it says here you've cracked your tooth. Let's have a look."

"Cracked it on a rock cake. Poor Hagrid, I think he thinks it needs to be baked into a literal rock."

"Hagrid..."

"Yes, he's a friend of mine. He works at my son Ron's old school, you know - the one where he met Harry and Hermione."

All pretense of an examination was abandoned as Dr Wilkie sat down shakily. "Hog...Warts?" She said uncertainly.

"That's the one! It's a magical place... You half-expect trolls and unicorns to come out."

"Hah...Unicorns..."

"Of course, normally you have to come from the "right sort" of family to go there - but Hermione Jean Granger wasn't going to stand for that nonsense..." Arthur carried on blithely, ignoring the tears beginning to stream down Dr Granger's face. He carelessly shook his sleeve and his wand fell out onto the tile floor. "Oops."

Dr Helen Granger's screams brought her husband running.

--------------

It had taken a little more of the same, combined with Harry and a few simple showy spells to bring back the Grangers' memories fully. First came the tears, then came the anger.

"How could she do that to us?!" Fumed Mark Granger. "We're not simpletons! We're not children! We could have run away!"

"Darling, the war..." Helen attempted to soothe her husband.

"I know! But I feel so... Violated."

"You have a right to feel angry," Arthur began, "but you're alive. Because of what she did. Many others who had magic weren't so lucky." He put a hand on the other man's shoulder. "My son, Fred, for one. Come back to England with us. Your daughter needs you."

The Grangers looked at each other.

--------------

Arthur watched from a distance as the Grangers knocked on the front door of The Burrow. He ran a tongue over the gold tooth that they had insisted on doing for him before they left Australia. It was quite wonderful, even if he felt as extravagant as Lucius Malfoy. Maybe he would start a trend.

"Mum! Dad!" Hermione screamed as she flung herself into her parents' arms. As a group they dissolved into tears. Every attempt Hermione made to apologise was met with a shush and a tighter hug.

Arthur looked on with a watery smile. Humans, be they magical or muggle, never ceased to amaze him.
