Hi!

I just thought it would be interesting to have Harry time travel to Hogwarts a century ago with Dumbledore, wouldn't it?

It would be fun to have a genius!Harry or something compete with the old coot. ☺ So, do you know any fanfic with this idea?


** As much as I love the idea, something like this would be difficult to do seeing as there isn't much infirmarion available on Dumbledore's time at Hogwarts. All we know is that he was friends with Elphias Doge, and that he excelled in his studies.

Plus, there's literally nothing for Harry to do during his time there. He's already learnt everything, and there isn't a man who's constantly trying to murder him, so he needs something to do during his time there.

Time travel fics usually have Harry try to prevent the Wizarding Wars from happening. Either by steering Tom in the right direction (if it's during Tom's time at Hogwarts), or straight up telling Dumbledore everything.

You can't really do that, though if Dumbledore's a literal child attending his first year of Magic School. Which, now that I think about it, could make for a crack fic where Harry tries desperately to warn Dumbledore, but fails horribly because no person in their right mind would believe his perposturous story.

This idea popped into my head once, and I tried to write it, but there just wasn't enough information. The plot wasn't interesting because there wasn't really one to begin with. Couldn't get past the Sorting Ceremony.

Also, this completely unrelated, but I'm still annoyed Harry was born 99 years after Dumbledore, and not just a century.

*** Interesting... Although I would argue that the plot doesn't need to be the same as canon, or the typical time travel fics in the 40s.

Harry can grow up, he could be an amazing wizard. There's always Grindewald if you need a Dark Lord in your story. 😌

** The man was getting stuff published at Hogwarts and literally advanced the field of magic before he graduated. I feel like Harry's advantage might last until the end of second year.

*** That would be so if the Harry in the fic is canon!Harry. I've read plenty OOC Harry, that is, genius!harry or simply powerful!harry that are quite interesting. Perhaps to make the story more interesting Harry could be like this 😌
