Ok, so I was scrolling on my main feed on Reddit, and I happened upon a post on this subreddit that recommended Rude to stare by Elis1412, but now I want more lol. It doesn't have to exactly match everything in that. But I do want a Harry/Fleur romance, that unless they already met earlier, in which case romance is fine whenever, starts with them getting together fourth year where they met in canon. Marriage Contract/Soul Bond fics are fine with me too, and while in this particular case I would prefer to read just Harry with Fleur, I will also accept any stories with relationships between Harry/Fleur/other girls. Now saying that, if you do end up recommending something like that, please no more than four people in the relationship total, so for example Harry/Fleur/two other girls, unless the story is extremely well written even going against the requirement. So basically the only real requirement is at least Harry/Fleur everything else is I posted isn't set it stone and I will read a story that goes against one or the other of those as long as it is really good.

EDIT: Unfinished sentence fixed.

** My personal favourite: linkao3(13855500) Hope and Healing.

It's a relatively slow-burn Harry/Fleur. Very big on the hurt/comfort angle, but with plenty of adventure and the romance actually works really well. It also has some good (albeit AU) lore on Veela, which is always a plus.

*** One question: How angsty is it. I mean yes, hurt/comfort, there will be some. But is it melodramatic with Harry being an arse, or angst for its own sake, if you know what I mean?

One reason I don't like some fics is they make Harry an utter arse or do angst for its own sake. Y'know, "True Art is Angsty" or some other tropes.

**** It's not /too/ angsty. It is, as you said, a Hurt/Comfort fic - and there's a few chapters that pretty graphically show the /Hurt/ part of things - but the emphasis is mostly on the "Comfort", and Harry pulls through with help from his friends and girlfriend.

  Harry has a long and difficult path to overcoming not only Lord Voldemort, but also his trauma from his treatment at the hands of the Dursleys. AU with the story starting at 4th year. Harry/Fleur. This story deals seriously with abuse, which can be difficult for some readers. On Hiatus. Note in ch. 34.

  I could speak for hours about my rotten luck, about how many times I've been close to death. But luck is relative and some would say I am, in fact, extremely lucky. I would have disrespectfully disagreed. That was before I met fair Miss Delacour though; well even for a bit after I met her if I am honest.

** /Wastelands of Time/ (linkffn(4068153)) is pretty much my go-to recommendation and it is H/F, but it doesn't exactly meet your specific requirements (nor is it a romance-centered fic).

/The Lie I've Lived/ (linkffn(3384712)) is another great fic which has the pairing but is not exactly romance-focused.

I think you might like /Euphoria/ (linkffn(11534019)) or /Letters/ (linkffn(6535391)).

  Dumbledore was surprised when Harry Potter, the boy-who-lived, came to Hogwarts. He expected a saviour, what he got was a damaged boy who has no interest in playing hero for anyone. What does Harry want? He wants to be left alone. Will have my own characters starting from chapter 26. Dumbledore, Hermione, select Weasley bashing.

  A disillusioned Harry Potter begins to unravel his potential as the wizarding world follows the Triwizard Tournament. Harry delves into a world that is much greater, and more complicated, than he was aware of. The story contains detailed magic, politics, social situations and complicated motivations. It is a story of growth and maturation.
