I know a lot of people talk about Dark!Harry but I was wondering if there were any Dark!Albus works. Nothing Cursed Child compliant, though. It'd be interesting, I think, to him contrastes against Harry, his heroic father.


** The only fic I can think of is probably linkffn(Catharsis by nuhuh), though its incomplete (if pretty action-filled).

Tangentially related, if your interested in non-CC Albus Potter, you can try linkffn(Albus Potter and the Global Revelation) and its sequels. Its not dark, but its definitely a different characterization.

  Post DH. Harry could never have known Albus-Severus was the herald of the new dark age. He watched as his youngest child came to be known as the Dark Son. Now Harry goes back in time to save his family and his son from the dark path.

  *SERIES COMPLETE!* Book 1/7. Structured like original HP books. Albus starts at Hogwarts! The world is in tumult over a vital question: in the age of technology, should Muggles be informed of magic now before they find out anyway? But there are more problems (see long summary inside). And Albus is right in the center of them all. COMPLETE!
