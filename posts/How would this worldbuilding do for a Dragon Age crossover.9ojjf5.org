I've had the idea of a Dragon Age/HP crossover in my head for a while now, but I'm nowhere near a talented enough writer to pull it off. That said, I've thought about the worldbuilding for it a fair bit, and I think this method has potential:

Rather than taking place in Thedas, Earth would still be the setting, particularly Great Britain for the scope of the story. Staples of the Harry Potter franchise would remain (such as Hogwarts and the Statute of Secrecy), but they would have Dragon Age flavours to them. For example,

- The Fade is present in this story, and functions largely/entirely the same way it does in Dragon Age. It is the source of magic, it is where Demons/Spirits reside, and wizards go there when they dream. For both simplicity sake, and avoiding potential plot holes with the Statute of Secrecy, Muggles do not visit the Fade when dreaming.

- Due to the existence of the Fade and Demons, Blood Magic is now a real thing (as Dragon Age knows it). Blood Magic would still be outlawed as it is in Dragon Age, and all of the inherent risks associated with it (conspiring with Demons) would still apply. This poses the question of how would the Ministry handle Blood Magic, which leads to my next point...

- The Aurors have been completely replaced by the Templars. The Templars have largely similar duties to that of Dragon Age Templars, with two notable differences. First, /the Circles of Magi don't exist/. Second, the Templars are wizards themselves, working for the Ministry (very similar to traditional Aurors in this regard). Due to the existence of Blood Magic, the Ministry's attitude towards Dark Magic has been tweaked a bit. Dark Magic in the general sense is not illegal (except for the Unforgivable Curses), but Blood Magic definitely is. Therefore, the Templar's "Mission Statement" is to hunt down and apprehend Blood Mages/Maleficarum and/or wizards possessed by Demons or wizards conspiring with Demons. Speaking of which...

- Wizards and witches can absolutely be possessed by Demons, and it is a core part of Hogwart's curriculum (how to resist possession/temptation). The vast majority of witches and wizards can resist the allure of Demons if they attempt to, but there will inevitably be wizards who succumb to temptation.

- Going back to an earlier point; since the Circles of Magi don't exist, there are no Templars stationed at Hogwarts itself, and Hogwarts does not bar its pupils from leaving during Holidays, unlike the Circles. Attendance to Hogwarts would be mandatory, however. Since the Circles don't exist and Demons might possess children, and all children attend Hogwarts, the Templars have a simple solution. A small contingent of Templars are stationed in Hogsmeade at all times /just in case/, but they are rarely needed.

- The Darkspawn pose a bit of a problem with this world. The Darkspawn need to be a large enough threat that, when a Blight happens, everyone shits their pants for good reason. But this also needs to be balanced with the fact that Muggles can't know about the Darkspawn. A potential solution is to have an existing Harry Potter race be a stand-in for the Darkspawn and adjust details accordingly (Goblin rebellions are /far/ more dangerous than in cannon, perhaps)?

- This also brings up the point of Grey Wardens. For Grey Wardens to "work", they need to have the same mandate as before (stop Darkspawn/goblins at all costs), without being a part of an official government. Luckily, the Harry Potter world has experience with extra-judicial groups in the form of both the Order of the Phoenix, and to a lesser extent, Dumbeldore's Army. Using the Order of the Phoenix itself could also work as a stand-in for the Grey Wardens: a secret society created long ago to combat the goblin rebellions, with Albus Dumbledore being the current leader. And this loops us right back to Blood Magic...

- Grey Wardens retain their special Darkspawn/Goblin fighting powers due to a Blood Magic ritual. This causes obvious friction with the Chantry/Ministry, seeing as Blood Magic is illegal. However, the Grey Warden's standing in Thedas in regards to Blood Magic is basically "the Chantry doesn't like it, but since we're the only ones who can stop Blights, they look the other way as long as we don't flaunt it to others." This concept would require little to no modification to work in this hypothetical crossover; the Ministry/Chantry looks the other way for the Grey Wardens Blood Magic shenanigans as long as they keep it under control and don't make a big fuss about it, but can still lead to plenty of friction/conflict with the Ministry/Chantry. Speaking of the Ministry/Chantry distinction...

- There are two ways this can work. The first is that the Ministry of Magic doesn't exist, being completely supplanted by the Chantry in this world. But I don't think this quite fits due to how anti-magic the Chantry traditionally is; instead, I think the Chantry should be a department within the Ministry. The Chantry would in all likelihood be the largest and most well-funded department in the Ministry, and its duties would easily overlap with other departments. For example, The Chantry would tell Magical Law Enforcement that Blood Magic is illegal due to divine/religious reasons. Speaking of religion...

- Religion plays a huge role in Dragon Age, specifically Andrastian faith. Everything/almost everything the Chantry and Templars do is due to Divine reasoning. Whether it's because of a line in the Chant of Light, or trying to root out those "heretical" Dalish Elves, religion is the driving force behind many actions in Dragon Age, not the least of which is everyones attitude toward Blood Magic and magic in general. This would easily translate to Harry Potter in this case if the characters weren't as serious about it as in Dragon Age. For example, students at Hogwarts are taught certain staples of the Chant of Light (Magic exists to serve Man, but never to rule over him), students are taught that the reason Blood Magic is illegal is partly due to the Chantry saying it is, regardless of how dangerous it actually is (note: still dangerous). And HP characters not being as serious about faith can take many forms. It can be as simple as most characters not being super devout, but rather being closer to your average modern day protestant (if that makes sense?), or it could be that some characters have grievances with the Chantry itself. For example, the Chantry tells students "Magic exists to serve Man, but never to rule over them" and while the Pureblood students nod along at school, they disparage the Chantry in private for trying to teach them that they aren't better than the Muggles.

- It would be a bit odd to have a Dragon Age crossover and have Elves and Dwarves be completely absent (I don't think the Qunari can be a thing in this world because I just can't think of a good way to implement them). Harry Potter already has 2 races that pose as surprisingly suitable stand-ins for Elves and Dwarves. First, the goblins are pretty close to the Dwarves as it is with a bit of handwaving. But wait! Didn't I already use the goblins as the Darkspawn stand-in? I certainly did, so now we have 2 choices. Either use something else for the Darkspawn (this is probably the best/easiest solution since there's no reason why the Darkspawn /has/ to be goblins), or use something else for Dwarves. Let's assume we're just going to make goblins Dwarves, and something else Darkspawn (perhaps just put the literal Darkspawn on Earth?). Elves are pretty simple. "The elves are a lithe, pointy eared people who excel at poverty", as Sten would put it. House elves fit really well with this, in my opinion. This might be the fannon talking, but isn't it stated/alluded to in cannon that House Elfs used to be able to use wands until wizards outlawed it? Certainly fits with the "Shems ruining the elves good day" motif in Dragon Age.

As for what the actual /story/ of this fic would be, we have 2 choices. First, we could just do a re-hash of a Dragon Age plot in this new world. Second, we could do the Voldemort/Blood War conflict in this world, which I think would be really interesting. A lot of conflicts could be introduced into this setting due to how people will handle the Voldemort threat. Perhaps Dumbledore starts using the Order of the Phoenix to combat Voldemort, drawing the ire of Magical Law Enforcement? Who is this man, using this ancient and respected organization to fight his own personal crusades? Since when did the Grey Wardens/Phoenixes become vigilantes? How would Voldemort use the existence of demons and a dreamworld mixed with a massive religious presence to prey on the fears of Purebloods? Could people be convinced that Muggleborns are more likely to be possessed?


** So, bit of a Dragon Age nerd incoming.

An option to keep the darkspawn a threat but secret from the muggles is have them be "hungry" for magic. Like how canon darkspawn follow an Old God's call, HP darkspawn are drawn to magic. The Archdemon or equivalent could be the stronger song, but the wizards be secondary.

​

If you want to go down the HP Blood War plot path you have a couple options:

1. Voldemort plays on the Pure blood Demon fears. Specifically the "logic" (how accurate this is is up to you) muggleborn are more susceptible to demons because they aren't taught from birth to fear their dreams.

#+begin_quote
  -- Have muggleborn be unafraid of the Fade/Spirits in a similar vein to Solas.

  2) He plays on the Chant of Light. Specifically the part that says the Maker will return when His Song is sung from every corner of the world.

  3) Plays on the stereotypical pureblood ego ("These upstarts are changing your way of life, opening the door for demons and abominations to walk the land")

  4) The Voldemort purebloods are more like Tevinter than not. "I see your blood magic laws, but I've always felt they were more like guidelines."
#+end_quote

Unrelated to any of the above plots specifically, but you could have Voldemort be a Darkspawn/Magister Sidereal/Ghoul along the lines of Corypheus/The Architect. To hide this you could have him either work through proxies (like Sampson and Calpernia(?) in Inquisition), or have a glamor. This would allow you to have Dumbledore use the Grey Wardens against him (additional possibility, have Dumbledore be a Warden Commander).

No one would believe that Voldemort is a Darkspawn because he's not

#+begin_quote
  A) a mindless drone who's only plan is ATTACK or DIG

  B) There is no Archdemon or Blight

** Another option for dwarves is have them replace the money handling / bank aspect, while darkspawn take on the antagonistic issues with witches/wizards and the rebellions. Essentially split the HP canon functions for goblins across the two other races evenly.

*** That could work really well. The goblins aren't that essential, and it allows the "Goblin Nation" stuff from fannon to have a better footing.

** Could Demontors or Nendu be Darkspawn instead? An army of dementors seems just as terrifying as darkspawn, while also keeping characters like Flitwick around.

I don't see why Qunari couldn't be around. They honestly seem like a blend between the strength of Giants and the culture of centaurs, no? Maybe they're a North African/Central & West Asian species that lives in mostly desolate areas like the Sahara, keeping to their clear influences from in Game?

*** Dementors definitely make sense as Darkspawn, the reason I didn't list them was that I thought the Dementors work really well as Despair Demons. Your point about Flitwick is something I hadn't considered.

As for Qunari, your idea is far better than any I've come up with. The only complication potentially is that no one really knows where the Qunari come from, and even the Qunari themselves don't really understand it. That would be a little trickier to pull off in the setting of 20th century Earth.

**** I mean, you could remove that whole aspect, have all the sentient humanoid races have similar backgrounds? A throwaway line about "qunari, centaurs, giants, and goblins all appeared" appeared. It's magic you know, you can throw some of that shit on it and make it work.

You could browse through 'fantastic beasts and where to find them' to find some kind of nasty beastie that suits your darkspawn idea, cause the dementors as despair demons is pretty cool tbh.
