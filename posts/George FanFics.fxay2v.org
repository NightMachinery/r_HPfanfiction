Hi all, I know this question has probably been asked before, but are there any good George centered stories out there? I'm pretty new to the world of fan fiction. I've read a few short ones on Ao3, but I'm looking for something a little longer, and well-written. Maybe George after the events of Deathly Hallows? Any recommendations are welcome!


** - linkffn(7562379) ... primarily about Ron & Hermione in Australia looking for her parents (without explanation why they haven't the secret Granger's location method mentioned in linkao3(The Wheel Is Come Full Circle by White_Squirrel), but that's the only small weakness of the story), but with really great George dealing (badly) with losing his brother.

- linkao3(Inner Demons by serendipity_50) ... again, primarily Harry & Ginny story, George is a bit in the background, but his grief is very believable.

- linkao3(The Arithmancer by White_Squirrel) ... of course, mentioning White_Squirrel, I have to mention this great story, which has Hermione & George pairing (and it is quite AU, so for example, Fred survives).

  Long-distance relationships are hard under normal circumstances, but Harry and Ginny don't have the luxury of living normal lives. Their relationship is put to the test when Ginny returns to school and Harry stays behind to continue his Auror training. Ginny soon realizes her greatest challenge may be in coming to terms with Harry's fame and dangerous line of work and deciding if she can make the sacrifices needed to be part of his life. Sequel to Starting Over. (COMPLETE)
