** "You did what?" Salazar Slytherin asked one of the students of his house, trying his best to keep the anger and rage from slipping into his voice

"Like I said, the mudblood cheated on the exam, and I punished him."

"You mean to say that you couldn't for a second fathom the fact that a muggleborn could surpass you in the exams, and decided to punish him by almost drowning him to death in the Black Lake?". The temperature in the great hall noticeably reduced,

"He is a mudblood! There is no way he could have been better than me at magic." The boy scoffed as if he had declared an universal truth.

"FOOLISH BOY! BLOOD DOESN'T MATTER! HE AND ANY OTHER MUGGLEBORNSSSS HAVE MAGIC AND THAT'SSSS ALL THAT MATTERSSSS!" He had almost unconsciously let a bit of parseltongue slip into his voice, which caused his snake to curl itself around his arm in an attempt to calm him down.

All students and teachers (except Godric - he was used to these outbursts) shuddered. The powerful aura surrounding the Head of House Slytherin made them flinch.

"What is going on here?" A very calm and serene voice asked. Salazar knew that voice and more specifically the tone very well. After all, he had been on the receiving end of it for more times than he would have liked.

"Nothing, Professor." The boy said a little too quickly, and Helga Hufflepuff narrowed her eyes.

"It sure doesn't look like nothing to me" she said. Her voice and face were both expressionless. For some reason, the boy found it greatly unnerving.

It was then that she noticed one of her own wet and dripping and breathing in short, painful gasps. She looked into his eyes, and attempted a passive Legillimency probe. What she saw had her almost lose her composure.

"It looks like someone needs punishing" she drawled, her gaze fixed upon the boy.

The boy had, of course, heard of the creative and ruthless nature of Professor Hufflepuff's punishments, and had to employ all his willpower and self restraint to stop himself from fleeing, or worse, wetting his pants.

Helga pulled out something that looked like ivory from her mokeskin pouch. It was about 10 inches in length, and it was 5 inches wide at the base and reduced in width as it tapered to form a pointed end.

"This is an erumpment horn" she declared nonchalantly and way too casually. Everyone took a few steps back in fear, except the boy, who was too shocked to move.

With a few waves of her wand, Helga attached a string to the horn. The resemblance to a necklace was not lost on anyone.

With a few casual flicks of her wand, the erumpment horn now lay against the chest of the boy, held there by the string which was tied around his neck.

"Good luck" she said with a glint in her eyes.

There was a very tense silence for a few seconds after Helga had left before chaos ensued. Everyone ran haphazardly, trying to put as much distance from the boy as possible. After all, ending the day blown to pieces were not in the agenda of the students of the newly founded Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

Saying that it was the worst day in his life would be the understatement of the century. The boy would have preferred anything else to this. He spent each and every moment wondering whether the erumpment horn would explode. Each and every tiny jerk in his movements caused his already fast beating heart to beat faster. Finally deciding that he could no longer take it, he knocked on the door of Professor Hufflepuff's office.

"I'm sorry... Please remove... I don't want to die... Please... I" he stammered when Professor Hufflepuff opened the door

The Professor fixed him with a withering glare before her features softened.

"If you are truly sorry, I see no reason for your punishment to continue."

"Thank you... Sorry... Thank - "

"I would never endanger the life of a student. You will find upon closer inspection that the horn you are carrying is of a very odd creature which I came upon recently. The crumple-horned snorkack. I am told that you are a prodigy in Potions. I would love to see you use the horn. Off you go"

The boy vowed to himself to never ever cross Helga Hufflepuff. After all, Slytherin may be intimidating, but Hufflepuff was pure evil.

** Oh, nice. I like the concept of underestimated Hufflepuffs, they surely have their strengths to have an upper hand over other houses too. Interesting how it might be shown through Helga's and Salazar's portrayal.
