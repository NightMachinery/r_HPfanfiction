So first, I'm a Canon supporter and try to stick as close to it as possible, though I make a few exceptions. Now that that's out of the way, here is the general topic. Population.

In my mind, Wizarding Britain is around 20K. I mean, I heard JKR said it was 3K somewhere, but that doesn't fit with what we have seen, especially government and a Quidditch league with 20-ish pro teams. On the other hand a 20K population is way too big for a single school as Hogwarts, which is roughly around 300 if we stick to the books, and 1000K if we follow JKR comments. Even if, as JKR has said, some are homeschooled... we would have at least half of the students being homeschooled (which doesn't make sense, it is obvious most families want to kids to go to Hogwarts). In that regard, a 1000K Hogwarts population would mean that certainly the classrooms we have seen are way too small and should be more teachers and the whole thing should look more crowded.

Building up on that I have a small project of mine. You see, I'm planning on writing a fic of a boy who is born in 2100 and attends Hogwarts in 2111. For this I started the massive task of building some spreadsheets with the following:

- Wizarding Families... Who married who, blood purity, birth and death dates. Most relevant info.

- Hogwarts listing... which year they started HOgwarts, which house they were sorted, Patronus? Quidditch positions...

- Quidditch teams each year and results

- Hogwarts Staff each year

- Head of the top tier departments... when each one changed position etc...

- Wizengamot... each change in the lineup

And I'm doing this for each each year from around 1845 to 2118-ish

​

So it is a titanic task. I have around 400 persons on those spreadsheets already (Canon and non-Canon)... and it is obvious the numbers are not going to fit. There are just so many persons there. And I have only Potters, Abbots, Fawleys, Malfoys, Ollivanders completed so far (other families are there in different states of completion)...

The thing is, I have been thinking how to solve this thing and the best I have come up with is this: Ignore books in this regard and consider that there were more people in each year (even boys on Harry's year). This means adding more teachers per subject and make the main ones "head of subject" so probably the head (McGonagall, to name some one)... can probably take like 3 years (5th, 7th and something else)... while other teach deals with the rest. McGonagall would still give a class each month or so to grades she doesn't teach, she would like to stay in touch with everyone after all.

So for those who write things close to canon as I do, How would you feel about:

- Having this arrangement, more kids in Harry's year. How many is it okay without feeling too AU? 1? 2? 10? ahaha

-How would you feel about having other teachers besides the heads teach Harry's classes? It is kind of odd since, the story loses something if Snape is not there every week to mess with Harry.

- Should I just put a bunch of other students in some other years?

- How would the inter-house communications work with a bigger attendance... I don't see McGonagall talking to all 300 Gryffindors in the common room. Would a large meeting room per house make sense?

- How would the train hold so many students?

- Am I too crazy to attempt this level of faithfulness?


** Completely agree that 1 teacher per subject for the core classes is crazy!

I don't think a large population at HW would change too much, organizationally. Lots of large schools have divisions similar to the HW houses (like, being on an A/B/C schedule, or red/blue/whatever.

** It's a known inconsistency in the books. You can go with both approaches.

1. small Wizarding World (30-40K), everyone goes to a small Hogwarts: you might have issues explaining the Quidditch League if it's gonna be a big part of your story.
2. big Wizarding World(200-300K), not everyone goes to Hogwarts. You can either have Hogwarts attendance be what it is in the books (300) or be what JK Rowling says it is (1000). Either way you're contradicting the canon assertion that everyone goes to Hogwarts.

At some point I think super detailed worldbuilding can become a problem. If there's a conflict and you don't want to deal with it, just make it an irrelevant part of the story or write around it the problem. I'm sure there are some really creative ways to explain how the wizarding world changes in 100 years.

  Slytherin House isn't what it used to be. There are barely enough children to fill a classroom, let alone a House Table, and the Quidditch captain is a muggle-born fourth year. For a new generation starting at Hogwarts as the war drifts into memory, there's far more to learn about the four Houses than they could ever have imagined (prequel to Snake Bites).

Fine. And up to 100 students/year. Less for the upper years, if people leave after OWLs.

#+end_quote

Precisely, which is why I avoid doing that. If you double all classes, and limit the student numbers such that class size don't exceed an unreasonable 50 students/class from two houses, you can get by with the Canon teachers.

#+end_quote

Had this precise discussion with a friend who went to an English boarding school, and the answer was that hardly ever, all students are present. If they /are/ present, the room is packed. Like, people sitting on tables etc. So precisely as you say, McG /would/ talk to all Gryffindors that way.

Magic, but of course, even with a regular train, 700 people isn't that outrageous. Up to 50 per carriage, so 14 of them.

** Canon actually implies the existence of multiple teacher per subject, Departments for the various subjects are actually mentioned. In the books Professor Sinistra is mentioned twice to be from the Astronomy Department, while Pottermore mentioned that Mcgonagall had started working at Hogwarts in the Transfiguration Department under the Head of the Deaprtment(Albus Dumbledore). The Transfiguration Department itself has also been briefly mentioned in the books. It's not to unreasonable to assume that each department has more employees than the Head of the Department.

And if you look at the Numbers of the students mentioned in the books about 200-300 students per house actually seem about right(how I got that number I wrote down [[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/gyov00/serious_fans_who_have_been_engrossed_in_a/ftca2a9?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x][here]].

You can safely ignore the 3000 that Rowling gave, she herself admitted when she said it, that she hadn't really thought about it

As for how the Train fits that many students, that can very easily be explained through the use of expansion charms, just have your MC notice that the train is larger on the inside and move on.

About the train, I guess the hardest part is not the trip in itself when you have magic. It would be more on the arrival and departure. I guess over 1k students arriving at the same time at King's Cross with carts can be noticed... Or that the Hogsmeade station would be an awful bottleneck. Maybe different trains from different stations, maybe even arriving at different times?

Come to think of it Great Hall seems proper for 300 ish students but not for 100K. Also, seeing 40 students get sorted would not be the same as seeing like 150 and still waiting for dinner.

From a Doylist perspective it was likely because Rowling could only concentrate on a portion of the teacher, its why she only created names for 40 out of Harry's classmates.

From a Watsonian perspective you can easily explain it as the Head of the Departments requesting to teach Harry(we know there were lots of rumour about his magic potential), even.

When you're a wizard space isn't really an issue, even the space at Hogsmeade can be expanded and we already know that Hogwarts has no problem organising to more than a hundred carriages for the students. As for being noticed you have to remind yourself how oblivious muggles are, when seeing a bunch of weirdly dressed teenager nobody is going to think magic, if they even notice anything they'll it some convention or game

I dont think we have any reason to suspect the size of the Great hall is a problem.

As for the Sorting, most of those seem to be pretty quick, like I doubt it would much longer than an hour unless there were a bunch of Hatstalls that year, but wizard would wait anyway let me remind you that there was once a Quidditch game that lasted for six months because nobody caught the snitch.

** I think the only way to make things work is to consider that Hogwarts is a school for the Elite/upper class and as such primarily takes the purebloods/offspring of the major families. With the occassional talented muggleborn. In other words, the children of the "movers and shakers" of the British magical world and those muggleborn whose power is greater than average.

That means there are other unmentioned schools where everyone else goes. That has to be the case otherwise, with a population of only 2-3K the will breed themselves extinct.

If you consider JKR's comment of a 1000 students at Hogwarts that is roughly a little less than the size of Eton an "Elite" British School.

*** Only major families are enough to increase the numbers though. And somewhere JKR said specifically that Hogwarts was the only British school.

It would make more sense to have more schools, but then you lose some of that "all Wizarding families know each other"... The single school model allows it to be contained. I guess in the narrative it makes more sense to have a bigger school than more schools. At least IMO.

**** The problem is simple genetics and math. If JKR's 3K numbers are correct. You have roughly 1500 breeding pairs where the majority have a single child. So after one generation you have at best 750 breeding pairs. If the one child per pair hold up then the next generation is 375 breeding pairs eg. Without a major in flux of magicals and a large increase in children born than in an handful of generations there will be too few magicals to maintain the population.

So there has to be more magicals in the UK and more schools otherwise the UK magical world would disappear.

As far as everyone knowing each other that could be explained by the "elite" school. Eg. Everyone who matters knows each other. And if "who matters" includes those magically powerful (which explains Hogwarts taking muggleborns) that "power" has those few become part of the elite.

>.<

The only possible theory that allows, in my opinion, magic users to be so incredibly few is the one where magic is semi-sentient and there are always a set amount of magic users. If there is a drop and the numbers decrease, you get a bunch more muggleborns and increased fertility. If there are too many, you get incredibly low fertility and high rate of squibs. Or something similar.

If something like the above isn't true, then I can't see any single possible world where magic has existed for millennia where magic users aren't a) the dominant species and b) an extremely advanced civilisation.

The short version of the explanations are: I think magic is too much of an evolutionary advantage -> way more people -> way more people that have the potential to be Einsteins. Magic allows for incredible feats. Feats that should allow those "Einsteins" to innovate more and faster than the humans did in our world -> more advanced civilisation.
