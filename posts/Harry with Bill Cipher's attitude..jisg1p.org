I suppose On a Pale Horse fits, but it wouldn't have to be strictly MOD Harry. He could just be insane, to an evil eldritch entity. Even a chaotic asshole would be amazing, lol


** Bill Cipher, you say?

Linkffn(Kid Cipher) is pretty good, considering Harry's raised by Bill in this one! Prepare for gore!

  On a whim, Bill Cipher takes a short break and returns to Gravity Falls with the young Harry Potter under his arm. Ten years later, Harry arrives at Hogwarts with a love of physical pain, a stash of severed heads, and dexterity in demon magic. Inexplicably Human!Bill sometimes but not always. INCONSISTENT UPDATES.
