I read 0800-Rent-A-Hero by brainthief, and I really like the take it has on Divination. Harry dimennsion-travels and ends up as the Divination professor sort of by accident, but he decides that he will do his best to actually teach the subject.

Harry researches how the subject used to be taught centuries ago using the Room of Requirement and, for example, he learns you have to 'atune' crystal balls and then use an actual spell to see something. It develops clear procedures for the different branches of Divination, instead of just guessing random things you see.

I'm linking the fic itself as well, for those interested

linkffn(11160991)


** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10629488/1/Blood-Crest]]) has a lot of divination (and magic theory in general). Harry makes use of tarot cards for example.

** I've got the best fic for you. It's actually so brilliant and I can't express my love enough for it, it's fits this prompt so well. linkao3(unfogging the future by Naidhe) has Divination as an actual useful skill that the main character, Lavendar, has. She gets transported to 1947 and gets a job in a fortune tellers shop. She gets taught Divination methods, for example, the witch often does get drunk or use the ‘special fumes' because it opens up your mind to different currents and possibilities , which kind of explains why Trelawney was drunk.

  Lavender takes one step forward and -- just like the snap of a finger, the blink of an eye, the drop of a pebble -- Hogwarts is left behind. There's no jump, no flashes of light, no whirlwinds of disconnected images. Just one little step; behind stood her war and in front stands 1947. "Huh," she says to herself, "didn't see this in the tea leaves."

*** Also came here to rec this! Here's a review that I wrote for [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPSlashFic/comments/nilzxk/ten_time_travel_titles_to_try/][this post]] last week:

Lavender/Tom is probably the oddest pairing I have ever read, but it somehow really works here. Lavender time travels to the 1940s and begins working as a Seer to make ends meet, which is how she meets Tom and ends up investigating a mysterious murder. Lavender is really fascinating in this story; she's a pragmatic adult who survived a traumatizing war, but she retains her femininity, her brash confidence, and her... selfishness? Selfishness in the sense that she looks out for herself and her own and doesn't go out of her way to be righteous. Tom is very amoral and ambitious, but he respects Lavender and what she can do. I feel like they both have equal power in the relationship, which you wouldn't expect. "Unfogging the Future" has great reread value with the mystery solved, because you'll be able spot clues you missed and focus more on the varied Divination techniques and occult references.

  Regulus wishes -- sometimes, not too often -- that he were like Sirius, able to make things up on the spot. Sirius says he has never seen a single bloody thing in his tea leaves, or his cards, or his palms, in the milky depths of a crystal ball or the glistening entrails of a dead pigeon. He just enjoys telling stories. Regulus sees water. His tealeaves: Dregs of muddy water. His cards: The Queen of Cups, waiting by the waterfront. His crystal ball: Unmoving, opaque water. His sign: Cancer, one of the Water Trigon. His palms: Somehow, impossibly, water. So, yes. He really did deserve that P in Divination. - Or: Regulus thought he knew all the horrors of Grimmauld Place, but on this stifling hot summer night in 1976, the house seems hell-bent on terrorising him in new and interesting ways. It's all Sirius's fault, of course.
