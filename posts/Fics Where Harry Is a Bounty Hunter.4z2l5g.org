Not just a bounty hunter, but breaks people out of Azkaban and stuff too. And, of course, his services are so overpriced the Malfoys would have to sell Malfoy manor to continue being broken out.

  After the fall of Voldemort, Harry makes a dumb career choice and Ron tags along. Hermione, sensibly, doesn't. Seven years later, a very different trio are drawn into an international web of intrigue by a little girl and an old relic. Lesson to be learned: stay in school, kids. Post-DH; Slightly AU. Rated M for language and violence. Not slash.
