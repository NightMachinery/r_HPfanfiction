If in a senario where electronics don't work, making modern muggle conveniences impossible, most people settle for the easy option, a mechanical watch, an basic alarm clock.

Forget all that, I want to see Hogwarts taken over by a generation of steampunk enthusiasts that just realized that their time is now. I want to see trench coats and automation running around.

If electronics don't work, choose the next best thing.


** Damn that's a shame I'm not an arter, I'm definitely into this!

** I can see MagiTech having steampunk vibes.

Also, would a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxhole_radio][Foxhole Radio work]]?

*** Depends on how magic disrupts electronics, for example, if it disrupts waves (Radio, infared, etc.) It probably wouldn't work, if it adjusts the conductivity of certain substances in common electronics, (gold, slicone, etc.) It probably would.

Edit: pIt might work if magic acts as s constant high/low current, effectively emp-ing the area constantly, then it probably wouldn't work.

** This is an old snippet that I've posted before, but it's not extensive enough to put up as a chapter, so I'll just repost. It's a /Girl Genius/ fusion.

"Harry! Good news! You don't have to worry about the whispers in the walls anymore!" Harry Potter turned around, forcing down the feeling of dread, as he recognised the voice, and, worse yet, the inflection in the voice. The prior year and a half has taught him and his fellow Gryffindors to read the moods of their fellow Gryffindor Hermione Granger very well indeed, and her present mood was best described as "I just had another Episode, and I am looking for a +victim+ audience to show off my creation to." (Her beaming expression, and her face covered in soot with circles of cleanliness around her eyes where the goggles---presently up on her forehead---had been, only confirmed his assessment.) However, the witch had already spotted him, so it was too late to flee.

Not five minutes later, he found himself being dragged by Hurricane Granger into the girls toilets, past what looked like an unconscious form of a redheaded girl with a big lump on her head, through a hole in a the wall wedged open by a pipe, down a rope ladder on a slide, and into what he surmised had been (at some point in the recent past) the mysterious Chamber of Secrets.

"Welcome to Hogwarts Machine Room Number Four!"

Hermione was not very good at naming things, Harry mentally noted upon learning its new name. Still, that meant that there were at least two of her "machine rooms" that he did not know about, which was worrying, but did he really want to know? Abandoning that train of thought, he turned his attention to the contraption in front of him as Hermione rambled excitedly.

"... the biomechanical PetriBeam generator and Universal Solvent production plant..."

The centrepiece was the gigantic harness, which held an equally gigantic snake-like creature. Its body was merely immobilised inside an articulated harness, while its head was festooned with Hermione's incomprehensible technology. (One learned all sorts of interesting new terminology, like "articulated", when one got caught in Granger's vicinity during one of her Episodes; "festooned" he had learned from Seamus Finnigan, in a completely unrelated incident.)

The creature's jaw had been wedged open by struts, and a part of Hermione's machine extended deep into its oral cavity with further piping running down its throat. Its fangs were encased in glass funnels. A big wheel rotated slowly near the roof of its mouth, operating a piston to periodically squeeze the area just above the fangs, extracting a dark liquid that ran down the funnels, through a network of glass tubes, and into a collection drum. Hermione continued her ramble as she checked the dials.

"... at this rate, it can produce up to 5 litres a day, yes,..."

The creature's eyes... could not be seen, being completely covered by another contraption, which led to a scaffolding of lenses, prisms, and mirrors.

"... The PetriBeam generator is the most useful part, however. I've already built the receiver-projector on top of the Astronomy Tower, and, once I link them up, we will be able to petrify any enemy that tries to approach the castle. Eventually, receiver-projectors can be placed on other towers and in other locations with good overview as well. This will complement the Hogwarts's defences by giving it medium-range counterattack capability."

Harry shuddered, recalling the Mandrake Sonic Projector Incident.

"... and, between the feeding tube, the articulated harness, and some electrostimulation, I can keep its muscles from atrophying, to keep it in good health. What do you think?"

The mad witch finally paused, making her way back to Harry's side and looking at him expectantly. In the brief silence, Harry was able to make out a whisper.

"K-kill... me... Merc-cy..."

"It's suffering," Harry whispered in turn, shuddering as he imagined himself similarly trapped.

"Oh, that? Don't worry, snakes aren't sapient---they can't think. It's getting fed and exercised regularly, none of the contact points actually cause pain---I made sure of that, so it's perfectly content. Just to make sure, I am going to implant some electrodes into its pleasure centres as soon as I find a drill that can penetrate its skull."

Harry forced down the nausea from /that/ image and focused on the point. "This one is sapient, Hermione. You know I understand snakes, and it spoke to me. It's suffering, and it wants to die."

"It is? It does? But..." She stared at her creation, her expression shifting to that of horror and guilt. "Oh, no, Harry! What have I done?!" Grabbing a heavy wrench in her hand, she marched over to her machine.

There was a moment when Harry was concerned that Hermione was about to release an angry giant snake that generated a "PetriBeam" (and he could guess exactly what that did, given what had happened to Mrs Norris) and a venom potent enough for Hermione to call it a "Universal Solvent" (which was saying a lot). He was even reaching for his wand to stop her. But then, she turned around, and that particular fear was dispelled, replaced with an arguably greater dread of another Episode.

"Foreman Dinky, break's over!"

There were pops of house-elf apparition. Hermione's elves (Local #0001, Hogwarts), already wearing those weird goggles and aprons, cheered as they rushed to the tool chest to equip themselves, while Hermione, who had somehow acquired a clipboard, began to sketch furiously while issuing orders.

A minute later, she beamed at him. "Harry, fetch me the socket wrench Number Seventy-Six!. We shall make this biomechanical PetriBeam generator and Universal Solvent production plant safe, productive, /and/ humane!"

Harry felt the now familiar wave of excitement and inspiration wash over him. Yes, of course he wanted to help Hermione with her latest masterpiece! But, it wasn't /his/ feeling, he had come to know. Others would get caught up in her excitement, but he generally found that he could keep his wits even when Hermione got like that.

He decided to go with the flow anyway. The witch meant well, after all, and /someone/ had to make sure she didn't go too far. How far was too far, however, he had no idea.

*Background:* The Department of Mysteries has a charity project to "uplift" Muggles and accelerate their development. This is done through prenatal interventions, imbuing some Muggles with varying amounts of technological talent and preternatural charisma. It's meant to create leaders who could both create and integrate big ideas and get others to go along to implement them. Some of their successes may have been Steve Jobs, Linus Torvalds, Elon Musk, and Craig Venter.

Naturally, the Unspeakables are strictly prohibited from experimenting on wizards and witches, so they carefully check the ancestry of every potential intervention subject. Hermione Granger had no known magical ancestry.

At first, her intervention appeared to be a success: young Hermione was very good at designing and engineering things, and at getting other people to go along. However, in August of 1991, she unexpectedly went off the radar. When she resurfaced at Hogwarts shortly after, the Unspeakables were had the unenviable realisation that they had accidentally experimented on a witch. If it came to light, they would be in huge trouble; but it was also an opportunity to study something that hasn't been seen before: the Muggle technocharisma uplift applied to a wizard or a witch creates a Spark.
