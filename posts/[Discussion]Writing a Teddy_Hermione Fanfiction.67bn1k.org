Hermione is divorced from Ron and Teddy tried to get Hermione to go out with him.

Any of you have any ideas or suggestions?


** I don't think that your idea would go well because it sounds like a cheap porn plot. What, your (god)mother is sad? Better bang her.

I think that this pairing would work better if you had no Hr/R at all or limit it to that one kiss during the last battle. Hermione would have left the country (finding her parents in Australia and staying there or a long term posting abroad would work). Then they meet at a random ministry function and Hermione does not realise that she's talking to her godson until the morning after. Ted is a common name, a metamorphmagus is not really recognisable and he could make himself look older.
