:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
A bunch where Dumbledore is bashed, in one where Harry is master of death and in beginning is like some agent in a wasteland, Another is where near the end, Dumbledore somehow unleashes goblin army on Harry and his group And a last one I couldn't find Is where Harry can become a black Phoenix, and is the fifth marauder calling himself Blaze or something, shows up in that form when Sirius is in his cell, and in front of Dumbledore at his office


** I don't recall a story where Harry is a phoenix named Blaze by I do recall an abandoned story where he is a Black phoenix called Blazewing and who brings Sirius food and other items before Sirius is freed from Azkaban. The story is called Harry Potter and the Heir of Magic by LordBladeDSF.

Another story where Harry is a Black Phoenix is called Runic Animagi by Kassien, though I don't recall what Harry's name is.

linkffn(5087671)

From Ruin by GraeFoxx has the Start of the fic being Harry in a wasteland as Voldemort uses the Mirror of Erised to go to a dimension without Harry Potter.

linkao3(13521369)

Another Fic that might fit this is 30 Minutes that Changed Everything by Radaslab starts the fic with Harry being the last person alive on Earth.

linkffn(5178251)

I don't recall a fic where Dumbledore sets the Goblins on Harry but I do recall a fic where Harry has the goblins join to fight against Voldemort in the final battle. The problem is that Dumbledore arranged for Aragog and his children to attack and kill anything on the outside of the Hogwart's wards. And of course, the Goblins arrive outside the wards so Harry and company leave the safety of the wards (one way only) to help their Goblin Allies. The story is called When Fate Intervened by LordVishnu.

  It all went wrong. Harry was locked away in Azkaban for decades as Voldemort destroys and conquers the magical world and beyond, unchallenged. However, Voldemort's greatest strength will be used against him when Harry is sent back in time with one mission, to kill the Dark Lord before he rises again.

  My first attempt at writing. When Harry's name comes out of the Goblet of Fire Dumbledore gives him a choice. Either participate in the tournament or lose his magic and leave Hogwarts. The Headmaster would never have guessed that Harry would lash out angrily and choose the latter. Minor Ron and Dumbledore bashing at the start. Wizarding War on a quicker timescale than in canon.
