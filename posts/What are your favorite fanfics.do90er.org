** I'm seeing lots of requests for "your favorite fics" lately, so maybe the mods should add a sticky?

--------------

For this type of requests, I like to link to the [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/169NVDxmtgDuwB7O1rZenT_WfKWTJqs-k-cdxd37xHWw/htmlview?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app][list of most recommended fics]] on this sub from 2011 to 2018, and [[https://hpffrec.hackesta.org/][the HPFanfiction Recommender]] that lets you search for more recent popular fics and authors.

Among the Top 20, my personal favorites are:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/][Seventh Horcrux]], linkffn(10677106), is obviously the most popular one by a wide margin. This ‘Harry' thinks he's Voldemort, acts like Voldemort, has the power of Voldemort, but he only wants to teach DADA forever.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167), is my favorite postwar fic. Harry and his friends finally had it enough and declared war on the incorrigible Ministry and Wizengamot. They began with vigilante killings of Death Eaters who got off again.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185), is a dark war epic set in an extreme AU. It's one of the very few fics that has Harry raised by his own parents, but he actually turns out to be a lot more vicious than in canon.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/][Delenda Est]], linkffn(5511855), is Harry time travel to 1975. He teams up with Bellatrix and changes a lot of things. This Harry is war hardened veteran, and Bellatrix, despite following Harry, is by no means a paragon of virtue. But it's fun watching her in action.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/][Divided and Entwined]], linkffn(11910994), is another long war epic. This Hermione forms her own guerrilla group and becomes a very effective killer of rank and file Death Eaters. But Harry and Ron are not slacking off either, as they will come into their roles later in the story.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/][Stages of Hope]], linkffn(6892925), is a dimensional travel. Here, badly traumatized Harry, Hermione, Luna, and Neville are thrown into a new world where things have become very different. They are not particularly dark, but they kill Death Eaters without blinking their eyes.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/The-Dark-Lord-Never-Died][The Dark Lord Never Died]], linkffn(11773877), is a major AU in which Harry was raised by Sirius in France. He went to Beauxbaton along with Neville and the Weasleys, and was personally taught by Dumbledore there. In 1999, Ron volunteers to go spying in Britain, where he meets a loyal Malfoy enforcer, Hermione.

*** Stages of Hope is my all time favorite. It's ones of those I wish I could forget just so I can enjoy it as fully as I did the first time.

It's so different from anything else I've ever read. I keep looking for similar stories but nothing has seemed to come close to it imo.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13051824/1/New-Blood][New Blood]] by artemisgirl is definitely my favourite fanfic that is currently updating. Slytherin Hermione and really well written.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13356023/1/Voleur-D-%C3%A2me][Voleur D‘âme]] by Twubs is a close second, competent!Ron/Fleur, Ron is a SI in this story with knowledge of the books and a different personality though.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11517506/1/The-odds-were-never-in-my-favour][The odds were never in my favour]] by Antony444 is also really good in my opinion. Its pretty AU, but absolutely worth a read.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5987922/1/Number-Games][Numbers Game]], it's what I like to see in fanfiction, it uses the creative elements of an already established world to its advantage, it expands upon a potential outcome for a certain character, it also shows that character as having flaws without descending into outright bashing and manages to tell a tightly contained story creatively and well.
