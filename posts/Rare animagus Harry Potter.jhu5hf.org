I've come across at least three where he is a dragon, and a couple more where he's something other than a stag, or a falcon. I'm just tired of this not really being featured in fics, I mean, you can turn into a /freaking/ animal!! How awesome is that? So maybe, giant snake Harry, and/or lion Harry? Possibly?


** He is a black jaguar in Linkffn(Vox Corporis) along with a lioness Hermione; and a mongoose in Linkffn(The many Deaths of Harry Potter)

He's also a black jaguar in Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Rune Stone Path)

Summary-Following the events of the Goblet of Fire, Harry spends the summer with the Grangers, his relationship with Hermione deepens, and he and Hermione become Animagi. H/HR

** I think it rarely gets written, depending on how closely you stick with canon, because when does he have the time? Can't do it over the summers, doesn't have the Marauders' advantages, harassed pretty steadily by Snape et al. Not particularly conducive to the process.

That said, I've seen some interesting ones, although I can't remember what fics they were all in.

- phoenix (one of which he cured Remus of his lycanthropy)

- wolf ("Three to Step Back" by Sinyk; "This Means War" by Jeconais; the Dangerverse series by whydoyouneedtoknow)

- raven ("Quoth the Raven, Nevermore" by GenkaiFan, and at least 2 more that escape me)

- owl/falcon/hawk/eagle ("No Hurry at All" by RobSt; "This Means War" by Jeconais (yes, a double); there are a lot more--raptors are probably the most popular form)

- British robin ("Harry Potter and the Manipulator of Destiny" by Wheezy1)

- rhino/erumpent (don't remember the details but a one shot crackfic in which Harry tears up the graveyard at Little Hangleton IIRC)

- cat/kneazle ("The Accidental Animagus" by White Squirrel; "Growing Up Kneazle" by Manatocfox)

- stag (I only remember reading one like this and I've lost the fic)

- dog/grim?

I don't know that I've ever seen a snake Harry...rather odd, that.

(Quick note: all of these are on fanfiction.net, except the Jeconais story. That's on fanficauthors.net.)

  At the end of his first year, Harry's battle with Quirrell goes a little differently. Dumbledore asks for help outside the wizarding world to heal the damage. A HP/Avengers crossover that respects the timelines while throwing in new twists and characters you may not have seen coming. Year 3 is finished, coming up on Year 4. Enjoy!

  Instead of Durmstrang Academy, Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry was invited to take part in the 1994 Triwizard Tournament. When Ilvermorny arrives at Hogwarts, Albus Dumbledore is shocked to see the long-thought-dead Harry and Lily Potter appear, as well as the missing Sirius Black and Remus Lupin. This has certainly thrown a wrench in his plans!

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family, and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4. Sequel posted.

  Harry grows up watching anime and fantasizing about having superpowers. When his Hogwarts letter arrives, he jumps at the chance to live the life of a harem protagonist. Not a harem fic. Timeline moved forward to modern day.

  In 1993, Gilderoy Lockhart points a stolen wand at Harry Potter and Ron Weasley with the intent to Obliviate them.The wand doesn't backfire. Gilderoy's "discovery" of the Chamber of Secrets is a short-term success.Other consequences are not short-term at all.
