** In the books, the diary was attempting to use Ginny's life force to gain a body of its own, independent of what the prime Voldemort wraith was doing. Of the other horcruxes, only the locket is ever shown to have some kind of sentience, amplifying negative emotions and learning about the insecurities of those that wore it. As JKR often does, we are given a complex magical item that clearly has defined characteristics and capabilities in universe, but as readers it is never fully explained what they can and can't do.

I speculate that the ability to possess people who are physically and emotionally close to a Horcrux was something that was a known capability of Horcruxes as a built in protection. I also speculate that the ability to use the possessed person's life to generate a corporeal form to swap into was NOT an intended feature - people are much easier to kill that Horcruxes are after all.
