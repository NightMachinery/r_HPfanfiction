Does anyone have a one shot or small chapter fic that has a female Draco Malfoy/Male!Harry Potter?

Preferable on Ao3, but I don't really care as long as it's well well written.

Draco Malfoy died at the venerable age of 107, and who awaited him at the crossroads? His mother? His wife? No, it had to be his eccentric former rival, eventual best friend, and far too often partner in chaos Harry Potter. Oh, and of course he had a deal to offer Draco to live his life anew, and obviously there was a caveat to it all that he wasn't privy to, damn Potters.Fem!Draco
