I have seen this in literally every single fanfiction involving Sirius that I have ever read and I'm confused about where this impression comes from. In PoA, we see him as first as a madman intent on killing Harry, then as a madman intent on killing Wormtail. He doesn't have much of a persinality in this one. Then in GoF we see him as a very serious man, cocerned with Harry's well-being and sadety and worried about the tournament. Not much about him is shown in either of these two books. Then in OotP we finally see Harry spend a large amount of time with him, which reveals him to be a be a sarcastic, bitter, angry man, whose hatred and unkindness to his house-elf eventually gets him killed. He only really seems to come alive towards the end of the book, during the fight at the ministry, but this shows us very little of his personality. All we know about his school days are that he amd James Potter could "give Fred and George Weasley a run for their money" (I'm paraphrasing) and that he was a bit of a bully and once tried to get Snape killed. Where does this stock fanfiction personality come from?

** We know that he and James were always in trouble, admired by their peers, and that their teachers generally held affection for him.

In addition, you're little summary of Sirius doesn't at all describe the character I read. I guess it's a short lead from the information given to the likely student he was.

  "Naturally," said Madam Rosmerta, with a small laugh. "Never saw one without the other, did you? The number of times I had them in here-ooh, they used to make me laugh. Quite the double act, Sirius Black and James Potter!"

  "Precisely," said Professor McGonagall. "Black and Potter. Ringleaders of their little gang. Both very bright, of course -- exceptionally bright, in fact -- but I don't think we've ever had such a pair of troublemakers --"

  "I dunno," chuckled Hagrid. "Fred and George Weasley could give 'em a run fer their money."
#+end_quote

All from POA.

I always inferred it from the text. We know how F & G act, we learn that they were similar to S & J. I assume "fun loving" because they always made people laugh, professors liked them, etc. We can't just assume he was ONLY a bully when he was younger - no doubt Snape was a bully too, we only got to see the scenes from his memory so that's also very skewed. I think Remus says this in OotP or HBP to Harry... I don't remember when.

I don't think it's head canon, I think its definitely believable that in his youth, at some point (after he left his parents) he was very fun loving, carefree, and a prankster.

I've been thinking about that very one since I first saw this thread but I wasn't sure because I don't have books around at the moment and I wasn't able to check. and people ITT who confirmed OP's thesis that Sirius-prankster wasn't canonical didn't really help my confidence... should've trusted my instincts, huh.

#+end_quote

so now, a little more confident, I'm going to take a risk and tell you that Remus said it to Harry when Harry's head appeared via floo in the fireplace of the kitchen at Grimmauld Place, when Harry was disturbed by what he'd seen in Snape's pensieve-stored memories (James and Sirius tormenting Snape). Remus or Sirius said that James was only fifteen when that happend and Harry was indignant that he's too fifteen and that it's not an excuse, then Remus said that James's behaviour was regrettable but that Snape never missed a chance to hex James, so it's not like he was only a victim. that's OotP.

Though we do learn what Sirius was like as a student, however brief it is. He seemed more lively and jovial back then. And we know from Lupin that Sirius and James got into lots of mischief, and we know they made that map. It seems to fit that pranking would fit nicely into that picture.

** I wrote Sirius as a prankster in 2004, so it goes back awhile. I think it's pretty clear from canon. In the OotP Snape memories, we see Sirius very into playing a prank on Snape, though of course it seems cruel. But it's clearly not his first prank rodeo.

Of course, we also have the Marauders map, "I solemnly swear that I'm up to no good", which strongly implies they did a lot of pranking.

When Harry is talking to Lupin, he's told that his father used to hex people for no reason, and it's implied that James and Sirius were pretty much joined at the hip and did similar behaviors.

And then, as you say, we had "he and James Potter could give Fred and George Weasley a run for their money", and considering the primary attribute of the Fred and George is pranking, that's really enough by itself.

*** where do people get the idea that Sirius /tried to kill/ Snape?

he didn't. Snape himself said to Harry something along the lines that it was a cruel prank that would have ended up tragically had James not intervened.^{*}

what I gathered from the books was that it was a not-thought-through prank and Sirius just didn't fully comprehend the consequences.\\
malicious? sure. they hated Snape, and vice versa. it was said that Snape always wanted to know where Remus dissapeared on a regular basis, and potentially use that knowledge to get him in trouble. Sirius fed him the info about the willow so he'd get scared off after meeting a werewolf.

you need to take into consideration Sirius' point of view. he and the other Marauders had hung out with a werewolf regularly and have never gotten hurt (while in an animal form), so Sirius could've thought that the only difference was that they knew what they were in for and Snape wouldn't, and therefore would get frightened.

and even more pronounced argument against /tried to kill/ is that it would've also, probably directly, killed Remus.\\
do people really think Sirius would have killed one of his best friends? intentionally. really?

as I see it, it was just Sirius being massively stupid, short-sighted and inconsiderate kid. even blinded by hatred. but not murderous.

***** that whole action doesn't look planned or thought-through. James and Peter didn't know, Sirius didn't stop and think about Remus' position in this situation. for all we know he just blurted on a whim to Snape: /hey, go to the willow, push that knag, there's a tunnel./ done.

canon says that Sirius told James what he'd done and then James ran off to warn Snape. he wouldn't have volunteered that information if he'd wanted to kill Snape.\\
we know Sirius was intelligent. had /the prank/ been planned, he woulnd't have made such a mistake, endangering James in the process.

there's only one option left. he just didn't think.

*edit:* à propos that part of my comment you quoted and I failed to respond, sorry, I just went on with my reasoning.\\
I meant that in a kind of unconscious kind of way. like if Sirius just didn't consider that particular werewolf a serious threat, for the reasons I mentioned. I perceive the whole thing as a not-thought-through so the part where I said what he could've thought is not really thinking in any reliable manner. like it's an axiom to him that Remus is scary but wouldn't kill. or more probably the killing part didn't even enter that /thought/.

because he realized the full consequences right away while Sirius didn't? because he didn't think about Snape but just a human in danger? and a danger caused by his own friend at that?\\
and it is totally irrelevant /why/. he /did/. that's what matters. you can't diminish his deed just on your percived motivations of his actions. James /saved/ Snape, period.

and if Snape had died as a result of this action, analogically, it would've been true that Sirius killed Snape, regardless of his intentions. but he hadn't died, and the question is different. Snape could've died and it still could be true that it had not been deliberate on Sirius' part.

/even if/, doesn't change the fact that Severus lived. but then again, you can't be sure. Snape was the more possible victim here and James took off right away. I'd polemise. he didn't have much time for such deliberations. he realized someone could end up dead and ran to save them. for all you know he could've been thinking about saving Sirius, not Snape, nor Remus. book doesn't say what was he thinking. and it does not matter.

Remus' life more important? sure, beloved friend vs hated enemy, a safe bet.\\
but you can't compare bullying to a murder, we have evidence that James bullied him, even hated him, not that he seriously wanted him dead.\\
there are few people that I'd like to punch, hurt or even make suffer, but I'd never ever wish them death. I'm just not that kind of a person. and from what we know about James Potter he wasn't either. quite the opposite, we know he ran to save a life. that is was a life he hated is secondary in this case. why are you trying so hard to disregard this?

that's an argument that he didn't think and just acted. from what we know about him from the books we know that it was more possible for him to act recklessly than to deliberately hurt his friends. he couldn't have thought about that situation he'd put Remus in as /a laugh/, that leaves one option. he didn't think. had he stopped and gave it a thought, he'd have realised the precarious role of Remus' in all of this. we know he wouldn't have done that to Remus on purpose. there's a whole book about Sirius and that traitor issue, remember?

that's the least far-fetched option in this whole mess, but you keep arguing that your perceptions are more agreeable. and James' actions only support this version, but you say it doesn't matter because of what you think James was thinking... and what happened to your previous version that James was in on it?\\
I said what I think he was thinking too, but my version is preceded by an actual action from the book, and agreeable with persons' characters as we came to know them from the novel, not mostly opposite just to fit my story.

all in all, nothing you said here, gives any proof to your opinion that Sirius acted deliberatley /to kill/ Snape, nor that James was his accomplice.

this discussion is senseless.

So fun loving prankster is from an inferred personality type that does sometimes bleed through in cannon. Most people know or can imagine someone like this, so it is easier, and more fun to write him like this then try to imagine and write a character who has spent 12 years in jail having an eldritch abomination feeding on his happiness.

Sirius has the potential to be a fantastic character full of depth: His parents all but abandoned him, he mastered a spectaculer piece of magic at a young age, his relationship with Snape offers a good place to grow, one of his closest friends betrayed him (hate it when fanfiction tries to paint Pettigrew as barely a friend and incompetent during Hogwarts), friend was murdered in a war, and he spent a long time essentially being tortured.

However, this makes him a hard character to write. So, fun prankster Sirius usually shows up.

** It's not a very good painting but pre-azkaban it's very clear what the painting was.

** I never realized it wasn't explicitly canon. Thanks for pointing it out.

There's a couple things that could add to this fanon portrayal. You have Sirius whose animagus form is a dog. You had people saying he was a best friend /best man sort of guy. He was known to be good looking. You had Dumbledore saying he was "energetic."

If you think of a dog-man good looking prankster who occasionally bullied it's pretty easy to conclude the type of person he could have been prior to his damage in the stay in Azkaban.
