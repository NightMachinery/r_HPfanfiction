I hate them. I always nope out when they appear. They are used as a deus ex machina and to make/train Harry into a literal OP god of the wizarding world, for some reason.

Now don't get me wrong i don't mind if their stories are explored more, but there shouldn't be thousand year old portraits hidden (or out in plain sight in a room) that nobody ever found or whatever.

Part of the appeal of the founders is how they are shrouded in mystery and seem so ancient and unknown. When you try to explain it or have them reappear as a ghost or a vision or something for the first time in thousands of years to some 11 year old child, all the magic is lost. They are also usually portrayed kinda meh, or childish.

Anyone feels the same? It's like the same thing as Harry finding a portrait of his parents or other relatives in his vault or at the “Potter Manor”

*** Can I humbly add flamethrowers ‘of a linear circle' to the Rec list? Time loop, Harry goes back in time and gets adopted by Salazar slytherin before travelling back to the future the slow way - excellent worldbuilding for founders and marauders era, regularly updated with a great backlog to chew into already up, and anything by flamethrower is worthwhile.

  The Founders have spent the last fifty years separated and drifting, but with Voldemort rising, they're headed back to Hogwarts once more. Between a wary Golden Trio, Umbridge, and Voldemort's shadowy plans, there's little time to deal with their own problems, even though Godric knows it's tearing the four of them apart---maybe even irreparably.

  Running and hiding are all Regulus knows, and he has no plans to change that. But Sirius escapes Azkaban before Regulus can find the traitor who framed him, and suddenly all of Regulus's careful plans are falling down around his ears. Add in a meddling ghost, an old love, an overly-curious boy, and a desperate search for the remaining Horcruxes, and this year may just be enough to put Regulus back in the grave he thought he'd escaped.

  Rowena got too caught in her research and motherhood until she didn't, and Godric went out to have quests when he should have prioritized the students, but Salazar had always been the closest to her heart and the one who had stayed behind, again and again, to make sure their students were okay. Hogwarts was meant to be safe. Rowena had designed the wards, and Godric powered it, but Salazar and Helga had made of the school a home.

** also for me it... makes little sense how the founders are these near demi-gods of magical might in most fanfics.

Like... have magic devolved from then and until the books take place? Because most fanfics makes it look like 'ancient magic' is always 100 times better than current magic, which doesn't make any sense, as humans, by nature, would try to improve or make more efficient magical spells. Like with technology.

I would love to read a fanfic where ancient magic is portrayed as completely inefficient, like trying to use a wood wheel on a modern car. It CAN work, but it is dangerous, stupid and can lead to major problems.

*** I think they're portrayed as strong gods because since their time lots of magic has become seen as dark and been outlawed, and people forget that they used this magic.

Sure they were powerful, but so would you be if you used a shit ton of power boosting rituals.

Those wards would be just as powerful if you had muggle attackers to sacrifice to power them

Yea slytherins basilisk is massive, but so is any of them if it's lived that long

It's kind of the same as saying, “man before the civil war farming had much better profit margins, we should use hand labor too!” While forgetting that their profits were so high because they didn't have to pay their labor, they might have been powerful, but it might have been because of things that are seen as reprehensible today.

*** Wizards became insular with the Statute of Secrecy, this might lead to technological or in this case, magical regression. Compound that with ideas of blood purity, a natural tendency for wizards to hide their shit real good, and spell research to be extremely difficult. You get a weaker magical society.

Not to mention you have a Ministry of Magic that is reminiscent of Big Brother who might actively destroy knowledge they deem "dangerous". See: time-turners, animagi, apparition, the Trace. I think it's extremely likely that the Founders were unimaginably more gifted and powerful than contemporary wizards, save maybe the few like Dumbledore and Voldermort, who still are working in less than ideal conditions.

**** See, in the case of timeturners, I think the Ministry didn't regulate them enough. Hermione literally used hers to steal a dangerous animal and break out a imprisoned criminal. Also, before they were all conveniently 'smashed' in the end of book 5, they were all just kept in a cabinet in a room that a bunch of school children could just walk into. Even if you avoid the risk of paradoxes by taking the 'you don't change the past, just join it' approach implied by the ending of PoA, that is terrifyingly irresponsible.

Realistically it's probably a combination of romanticizing them by assigning them stuff created by various people throughout the years combined with the fact that they did in fact create at least a few key parts of Hogwarts.

*** Not defending these fics as I don't read them enough to care, but something to consider re: technology has always improved, I'm not sure that's 100% true. Overall, yes definitely, but there's also technological advancements that have been lost to history, that we still can't replicate because that knowledge either wasn't written down or was somehow lost.

I don't think that information would completely revolutionize the world and make us infinitely powerful or anything extreme like that lmao But ancient civilizations did create things that we weren't able to improve upon because we had to start from scratch with no idea how they did it in the first place.

So I think it would be pretty interesting to explore ideas of old magic that was lost to history, but obviously not in an OP godmodding way lol Especially if they give ideas to create better spells/potions than those that currently exist (even if those older spells themselves aren't that spectacular).

*** Dunno, it could be possible for the "level" of magic to have gone down. It's a pretty common theme in fantasy (even lord of the rings does it) and I've seen it a lot in Harry Potter fanfiction.

Also, the whole growth/improvement/progress thing is a pretty new concept in Europe or the world historically speaking. Like people in the tenth century didn't expect economic growth of technological advancement, which is good for them because they didn't get any for like another half a millennium.

On the other hand there definitely historical precedent for progress to be halted or even reversed, which is why we call the dark ages the dark ages.

Then there's a bunch of kind of plausible reasons fanfiction authors use:

-families hoarding knowledge and dieing out.

-the ministries being incompetent, afraid of powerful wizards, misguided, wanting to hoard power

-magic being cyclical over time, magic leaving the world, magic being driven back by Muggle advancement

-wizards becoming weaker because of in breeding after the statute of secrecy, or because of interbreeding with muggles, maybe wizards were born of humans interbreeding with magical beings and the further down the family tree the less magic.

-the schooling system being infiltrated by some nefarious group or having an unfortunately high level of manipulative evil headmasters, with agendas like: stealing and hoarding magical knowledge, weakening the general magical population

-wands being part of a conspiracy to weaken wizards or wands being a trade off somehow resulting in much better/easier access to magic for the vast majority of wizards while unfortunately limiting the growth of very exceptional/good like wizards

-same reasons why muggles lost knowledge: Vikings, book burnings, empires falling, religion, illiteracy etc.

Actually the I only found the first fanfiction i ever read with modern magic being explicitly superior last week :p

I think the founders were really just very talented wizards, like Dumbledore level at best, rather than gods. /Maybe/ the others had a special power like Slytherin but nothing more fantastic than Parseltongue.

In my mind the benefits of ancient magic would be group casting. A bunch of people aiming their wands and casting spells repeatedly vs them doing a ritual which would be boosted by ingredients, blood, and perhaps the moon.

In regular everyday stuff it's likely useless.

A one on one apprenticeship with a Master (see Harry learning the patronus) is going get better results than a dumbed down curriculum for the masses. Just consider, up until NEWTS, Hermione and Crabbe and Goyle are in the same classes.

That said, magic does evolve. I've seen portrait! Slytherin enchanted to know everything placed on the library shelves.

*** "Headmaster, if you want to find the artefacts of the finders, does Hogwarts have any portraits of them you could ask."

"They do have their own portraits in the school, Harry. They are on the second floor down the hallway from the charms classroom."

"Wait? You don't mean... those portraits?"

"Indeed. You see, the Founders lived over a thousand years ago, long before the evolution of modern English. Godric speaks a Celtic dialect which even at the time was dying out, the muggle tribe that originally spoke it having been broken up and absorbed by its neighbours a few centuries before. He is understandably irate at all the students passing by unable to understand him, so he has resorted to bellowing what I can only assume is invective at the top of his voice. Rowena's canvas unfortunately suffered from an attack by moths at some point over the last millenium, and while the physical damage has been repaired, her mind will never be the same again. While any artists hopes that their work will live on for years after them, it is quite hard to perfect techniques for that, as Salazar has unfortunately found. While at the time the varnish used to protect the paint was state of the art, it has undergone some unfortunate reactions to extreme aging including warping the magic beneath it. Helga is perhaps the saddest in a way. Whoever painted the portraits seemed to have captured all of her, including the mental stress from what has since been diagnosed from Pepperup Potion abuse. While it was likely not noticeable in her lifetime, an extra thousand years of progression has taken its toll."

"Oh. Well, do you maybe have any more memories?"

As an aside, I am pretty sure in canon portraits are basically animated pictures with a handful of pre-recorded lines, basically magical GIFs, not actual people.

** I've only used the founders in a fic once, and it was mostly just to serve as antagonists. The fic in particular was just me watching Dragon Ball Z, and thinking that I can do it better.

So, the main premise is that Magic is sentient and all the sort of hacks that appear in cannon are exactly as presented, with Felix Filicius being full on instinctual reality warping, and time turners being full on time travel, with the only thing stopping regular wizards from being high level reality warpers is that Magic, who calls himself Maggie, to avoid confusion with lowercase magic, steps in to smack down anyone who tries in indirect ways. The reason Maggie does this is because he is at the mercy of a higher power who makes him do so, with the threat of erasure. The higher power doesn't matter, and is just a plot device, but I do like keeping it around to inject some fresh eldritch horror every once in a while.

Anyways, the main thing that drives the plot is that sometimes people are born with Maggie's blessing, who are absurdly powerful, strong enough that only another with Maggie's blessing can oppose them, coming in several tiers. Four, to be exact. The first is just being very inately talented, the likes of Snape and McGonagall, enough to outclass regular wizards. The second is a huge amount of talent. Enough to be world wide figures based off raw power only. The likes of Voldemort and Grindlewald. The third is just an absurd level of raw talent and power. The likes of Dumbledore and Herpo the Foul. Enough raw power to match the combined might of wizarding nations, as shone when Dumbledore dueled an Elder Wand empowered Grindlewald, using non-lethal magics only. Something to be note, Dumbledore's education was limited to Hogwarts, and six months with a transfiguration master, with no real dueling training, formal or otherwise, all his skill being inate talent. The forth and last is unique in that Type Fours have a specialty, examples include Slytherin, whose specialty is one on one dueling magic, and Hermione, who specializes in magitech.

Anyways, in this fanfic, all four founders are Types.

Gryffindor is a Type Two half giant, who is generally fights using his body and magical weapons, using magic as self support and enhancement, rather than direct weaponry, with all of his gear being absurdly powerful, as they were mainly crafted by other, more magically talented founders. He is essentially a knight, which he is very good at, being so naturally talented at muggle combat that he can keep up with the rest of the founders using nothing but raw athleticism and skill, something bolstered by his half-giant heritage. With his armaments, only Slytherin could match him. He never appears in person, his main role being that people sometimes find his gear.

Slytherin is a Type Four, specializing in dueling magic. He is the father of modern magic, being the one to create bolt based spells, as more efficient method of curse delivery, as well as the creator of both the Killing Curse, the ultimate dueling spell, and the Patronus, the ultimate weapon against beings immune to regular dueling spells, mainly dementors, as he took the assertion that dementors were immortal as a challenge. Something to bear mentioning is that the modern versions of the Killing Curse and Patronus are degraded versions of a simplified version he made so he could teach to his students, who were only Type Ones, if that. His personal versions were a massive AOE instant death weapon, an instant 'I win' button if his opponent is on the same general landmass as him and an instant death weapon against beings that were unnaffected by his version of the killing curse. The Patronus in particular was heavily neutered, as his own version, conceptual constructs made of crystalized magic. Anyways, he shows up in the story as a direct, and recorring antagonist, which is why I put a lot of thought into his combat capabilities. He specifically put himself into stasis for exactly 1000 years, to see how magic progressed with his absense, since he grew frustrated by his lack of progress in his own time. He became an antagonist when he saw how there were as many as eight Type Fours running around when he arose, not counting himself, and felt threatened by having so many people near his level, and tried culling their numbers. Its more complex than that, and he has a reason to want the protag dead in particular, but I'm gonna move in in the interest of brevity.

Ravenclaw was also a Type Four. Her specialization is never elaborated on, but its implied to have something to do with crafting items and conceptual magics, as that is what she was best known for. She also doesn't appear in the story, her main impact being that she made most Gryffindor's gear and that her conceptual magics fueled Slytherin's inferiority complex.

Hufflepuff was a Type Three. She is a non-combattent, though she can still absolutely clap some cheeks if she thought it was necessary. She was a truly amazing breeder, with a love of animals. She does appear in story, ressurected by Herpo the Foul. He tried ressurecting all four of the founders, but she was the only one he succeeded in ressurecting. Ravenclaw and Gryffindor because they both died happily of old age, and neither of them wanted to be ressurected, so they put in protections to prevent that, and Slytherin because he wasn't dead. Hufflepuff crushes him while he is still exhausted from the ritual, using her own version of Slytherin's Killing Curse, which bypasses phylacteries. She then ends up having a touching romance with Hagrid in the background of the story. Its great, and the monstrosities they breed together occasionally show up in the story.

I mean how OP can Harry get before you say "fuck this I'm out"? Because canon-wise Harry has a deus ex scar/love protection/phoenix/wand machina to save him, it somehow doesn't seem much better to having Harry be actually strong, in a "Dumbledore casts Tsunami" kind of way.

** I don't like stories with the Founders or dead people portraits that have no substance. Like I understand that fanfiction is fantasy and wish fulfillment, but then I feel that their placement of importance in history is diminished.

This story is spans the time before Merlin was known as The Merlin™, through the Founders Era, and present time/2nd war against Voldemort.

Harry does some time traveling >! and he turns out to be Salazar Slytherin through the other founders antics. They aren't all powerful, they're just mortals trying their best. Their lives are explored !< and they don't train Harry to be all powerful because by that point he already is just from existing for so long. They become as close as family. The Founder's Era becomes another facet of him because he was there and lived it.

Anyway the story is absolutely fantastic and I thought it was satisfying. I wish everyone would read it at least once in our short lives. Be warned that I found the first 5 chapters to be confusing because I had no idea wtf was going on (I might have been sleep deprived) and was glad I read them a 2nd time before I deciding that the story wasn't for me.

  The destruction of the time turners in the Department of Mysteries throws Harry, Ron and Hermione a thousand years into the past. There they meet the Founders of Hogwarts, who are not at all pleased about what has happened to their school. They decide that something must be done.

** the only time I like the Founders when they appear have been ones where they're not "main characters". As in, Salazar's portrait doesn't become Harry's mentor, or Gryffindor's reincarnation doesn't adopt him. While those stories can be fun, these should be reserved for stories that shift Harry into their era in some way.

I love it when they're a single encounter, /maybe/ two - for example, Harry finding Salazar's portrait in the Chamber of Secrets, almost degraded into nothing, and then he has one final conversation with the remnant before its magic dies. The dead, especially the /long/ dead, should stay dead. To do anything otherwise needs a VERY good explanation in this world, because otherwise you invite some very uncomfortable questions and implications.

** That's just bad writing, they can be better than that.

The good fics tend to focus more on their own stories than just training up some OP OC. These were powerful wizards and witches back in a time where there was no statute, and despite how it ended they were initially friends, they probably got up to all sorts of awesome stuff.

Or you can have them in the modern world, marveling at the advances made in the last century and decidedly fish out of water, yet at the same time intelligent and capable mages.

** Ones where the founders themselves break down the illustrious illusions imposed on them by the histories tend to be a lot more fun. Slytherin's portrait in the Chamber is a realistic take though I would agree magic should be shown to have improved.

The couple I like off the top of my head invoking the founders or at least talking about them is

Linkffn ([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11446957/1/A-Cadmean-Victory]])

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3384712/1/The-Lie-I-ve-Lived]])

First one is portrait Slytherin, second has the sorting hat occasionally breaking the glamor around them. How Slytherin was basically a pretentious dick, Gryffindor a drunken alcoholic, and Hufflepuff a naive busybody. The issue, like all fics, is if it's well written and actually develops the plot.

  Not all of James died that night. Not all of Harry lived. The Triwizard Tournament as it should have been and a hero discovering who he really wants to be.

** I'm not super fond of them too. I can accept that they're pretty powerful but it feels wrong that they just need a bit of prep and then they'll be able to kick everyone's collective posterior. Or that they have some secret techniques that will turn Harry into a god of magic. Slytherin is by far the most egregious. When he's there to teach it's always that either Voldemort was too dumb to find his portrait or that he failed or refused to learn from Slytherin properly, so now Harry is here to do what Voldemort couldn't. Even worse though I feel is Slytherin reincarnation fics. I feel that the resulting personality is just smarmy. Always something about the Old Magic and druids too. It's like there's constant wanking of his superiority. He might as well be belting from the rooftops, "Everything you can do I can do better!"
