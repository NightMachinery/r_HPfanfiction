So this is perhaps not HP specific. But the trend is something I noticed specifically while reading this fandom. Has anyone besides my own perhaps overly critical self noticed just how annoyingly common the "Dumb Boy" trope is?

I've found in a good 80%(Not a hard statistic) of the Harry centric romances I've read Harry and the other fellas are portrayed as complete idiots in the field of women in general be it in the romantic department, the feelings department, sexually, even something as petty as gift giving. As a guy I find it vaguely insulting but thats not the point. Granted I know some guys who are just utterly clueless about all that crap, but its not like people are hugely complicated.

Part of it may be because they're Harry-centric fics(Because without him the rest of these people are uninteresting to me), and he is often portrayed as a complete social retard, but it tends to extend to Ron, Neville, Seamus or the others. (Dean is always a ladies man, which I attribute to either unintentional racism or random chance depending on my cynicism.)

Or is it more because a lot of fanfiction is (according to TVtropes) written by women and the general consensus among women is that men are all secretly idiots? I used to think it was a feminism type thing. Where a way a mediocre writer could show the female character as strong or independent or whatever by having her lead around the poor dumb guy by the nose. But that doesn't make sense. Strong independent people(of either gender) don't need to show off. Insecure, weak people show off. Which leads to my theory below.

My personal theory is that Romantic Comedies cause this stupidity. The RomCom popularized the stupid guy and the eye rolling girl who helps him fumble his way to her. (I mean her heart perverts). They continually perpetuate the most asinine ideals of how love and all that other shit works and what were seeing in fanfiction is the trickle down effect of years of popularized notions bashed into the heads of impressionable youth until it has tainted their concept of romance to such an extent that even their prose stinks of it.

Thoughts? And I should caveat. I don't intend this as a criticism of either gender. I think men and women can be equally stupid, and that the only thing that truly matters is being competent. Everything else is just plumbing or decoration.

Edit: this kinda got away from me. Let me know if you think it's not really relevant to the sub and I'll take it down myself.


** As with all common tropes, it's just lazy writing. And since fanfiction writers tend to be even lazier than professional writers, you get a corresponding increase in reliance on clichés.

If you ditched the trope you might have to write characters as individuals with motivations and differing attitudes and knowledge. That sounds like a real chore. Far better to just use pre-made lowest common denominator archetypes.

** I've noticed a really irritating emphasis on purity combined with the eternally over-protective brothers and father trope... I get that is reality for some people but jesus christ it's everywhere, mostly as a way of causing conflict between Harry and the Weasleys. Similarly, the pearl clutching over revealing clothes pops up in otherwise good fics - even Northumbrian has used it to manufacture drama between Harry and Ginny.

Also, it apparently being ok for women to physically hurt their partners. This is a societal problem obviously, but it does rear it's ugly head in fanfic often.

Rape victims falling in love with their rapists - one of the reasons I just don't read anything with rape in.

This is almost certainly flowover from people who have both read HP and watch anime, because the trope of female-on-male violence is often played for laughs in anime romcoms, to the point where the hotheaded female love interest who resorts to physical violence whenever the protagonist annoys her, is a named trope (Tsundere). Lots of people who write relationships where the woman gets a free pass to hit their partners, are most likely teenagers who watch those kinds of animes and don't yet know enough about relationships to realise they're not how actual real-life ones work.

**** I think you would be surprised. Half of the sitcoms out there play on this trope and they are written by and for grown adults. A prime example is Everybody Love Raymond. Raymond is always being slapped or punched by his wife when she is mad at him.

I've also seen plenty of adults and young adults that will slap or punch their partner because they said or did the wrong thing. There are those social experiment videos all over youtube that have a man being physically abused by a woman in public and in almost all of them, the people around either ignore the situation, laugh at it, or throw in their support for the woman. The common theme always seems to be that the the people who see it will only question "What did he do to get that?". When the videos show depict a male even raising his voice at woman, there are often many people stepping in to defend the woman.

***** In the case of Everybody Loves Raymond, I don't think the viewer was supposed to like Deb all that much. Ray is very much the "dumb dad" trope we saw gaining traction in the 90s, but Deb is hardly the the long-suffering, saintly wife we see in those commercials and shows: she's an unlikable hypocrite in denial, and the creators are in on the joke, because the way she gets away with the same behaviour that she lambastes Ray and the rest of the family for is almost blatant parody. People who think she's a strong, empowered woman are missing the point entirely.

I've seen the social experiments, and I'm not saying that Western society doesn't have problems that disenfranchise men, but the fics in question read like anime romcoms, down to the "it's not like I like you or anything" meme, and less like the dumb dad trope we see in Western media.

*** I agree that I'm tired of seeing this trope where everyone is obsessed with Ginny's virginity. I wonder if I didn't read so many fics about the couple, if such a plotline would rub be the wrong way as much.

Having said that, I can't lie and say I wouldn't mind if a story had Ginny having already lost her virginity when her and Harry get back together. Same with Harry. Obviously there would be nothing wrong with either Harry or Ginny not being each other's first, but they are certainly young enough where realistically they probably were each other's first. I don't like the idea of Ginny losing her virginity at 15 because most people who think it happened feel its because she wanted to show that she is an adult. I like to have a little more faith in Ginny.

**** And this goes for both ways. You have fics where she's portrayed as a Mary-like figure with her overprotective brothers, and then there are lots of fics as well that specifically mention in what way Ginny has already had sex (and with who). There is very little middle ground.

There are even fics where she talks to Harry about her sex life, and this just goes to show that a lot of fanfiction is written by people who don't really know how relationships work. I'd rather not listen to my girlfriend's past lovers, thank you very much. (Granted, no one's the same, and in some relationships this isn't an issue at all.)

****** True that, alas. Though honestly, personally I blame it at least to some degree on the whole separation of men and women and the stupid notion that a man and a woman cannot be involved without it being romance; because seriously, as bad as I am with emotional stuff I don't have any issues spending time with men as a friend (a woman speaking here, just to make that clear), but I see people treat each other as if they belonged to a different society altogether just because their sex differs, and then I see them try their hands at romance and end up with ... shallow ridiculousness.

Though, of course, many a romance fic are still written by people you could throw under a label of social rejects (regardless of whether it's their fault or the fault of their environment), just like many a smut fic are written by woefully-undereducated virgins, so that's that as far as stories go.

** I see a ton of fics with female characters who are useless as anything but a love interest, must always be worse than their male counterparts in every way besides the power of heart, and are pretty much interchangeable. -- Actually, they can usually manage makeup and dresses, and occasionally if Daphne Greengrass is the love interest she'll have competence in politics. It's as if femininity were almost entirely a replacement for a personality or skills. As if major characters normally can get four adjectives (following Milo Amastacia-Liadon's rule), five if they're special, and being a woman accounts for four of them.

There's also a huge tendency for female love interests to subsume their goals for male partners, which is infuriating. I read a fic where Hermione heard of a legendary artefact that essentially spells victory in everything you do. Her immediate thought was: I could give this to Harry! ...except she could use it for herself, with a goal of helping Harry to defeat Voldemort, and then continue to use it for her own goals. She's got ambitions, unlike Harry.

Another fic had Hermione thinking: "I love Harry, but it's nice to get recognition for my own accomplishments on occasion." Which is straight from bizarro world for me. Why would you /not/ get recognition for your own accomplishments? Why would a dude in your life be reason to eschew praise? Do you suddenly not deserve to be acknowledged because you have the hots for someone?

One of the saddest cases I've encountered was about Ginny Weasley. She had a rather awesome life, and a lot of the story was kind of slice of life. But there was a lot of low-level background misogyny, not as a problem to be addressed, just woven into the world. And at the end, it was revealed that all her choices were motivated by running away from Harry because he was dating someone else, instead of her own ambitions.

***** Yeah, that stuck out to me at the time as well. I suppose it's not impossible, though very unhealthy, to have your actions dictated by an unrequited crush years later. The reason I stopped reading though was rather Ginny's complete shift in personality halfway through. I mean, she makes friends with a couple of OCs, who she's supposed to have been close to for years, then suddenly makes an abrupt U-turn and starts having massive, pointless arguments with them regardless of any previous character development. Sigh.

Anyway I agree with most of what you said, but re Hermione's "I love Harry, but it's nice to get recognition for my own accomplishments on occasion" - it could have been not because being in a relationship means she shouldn't get acknowledged, but because it's /Harry Potter/ she's in a relationship with. Next to him, anyone's achievements would get overshadowed. Without reading the fic though I can only speculate.

Harry would be one of those guys. Even JK writes him as being clueless and semi-socially retarded around girls who aren't Hermione or Ginny. While most fanfiction writers flanderize the ever-loving shit out of it and turn Harry into a pants-on-head spastic around girls, him being dumb about romance and sex is canon.

** I actually see the opposite more than the dumb boyfriend trope. I read Harry/Ginny post war and my biggest pet peeve is when they make the couple so over-the-top in love as to be ridiculous. Harry gets the perfect gifts and acts ideally towards Ginny. If anything, they have Ginny act a bit poorly as a girlfriend (not bad or anything, just little things). I wonder if the dumb boyfriend trope is more common in fics that take place during Harry's 6th year.

The biggest issue writers seem to have is to portray the couple as a typical teenage couple that have normal fights and act like their age or something around their age.

** With certain characters, I don't really consider it a stereotype or any form of discrimination against men. Specifically Harry and Ron, although more Ron. I really wouldn't put it past Ron to give Hermione a Quaffle for her birthday present. Harry is better, but it's clear from the disaster with Cho that he can be an idiot when it comes to girls in canon, so I usually take it as the author attempting to keep true to the characters. Harry's idiocy is often exaggerated, though, but I've always assumed the author just wasn't that good at characterisation or something.

Otherwise, I agree with Taure that it's lazy writing. With Harry!centric fics, you get very little male characters of the same age that are fleshed out in canon that aren't stupid (the only really fleshed out characters are Ron, Harry, maybe Neville and Draco towards the end?). So it usually falls on the author to flesh out and create well-rounded characters, which precious few are willing or able to do.

Although, I think perhaps, the lack of awareness when it comes to discriminating against men contributes. So many people think of how to empower women, they end up discriminating against men in an effort to do so, as well. I'll admit to falling into the trap of this type of thinking myself, though I think (and hope) I've been getting better recently.

Your theory on romcom influence is probably true, too. Popular culture often celebrates certain stereotypes of both men and women, and the more impressionable generation forms their ideals of what life is like through that.

I don't know much about feminism because it's a philosophy that has no relevance to me, and was not supposed to be the main or even secondary point of the post. However my, perhaps flawed,understanding was that feminism was the concept of achieving equality through empowerment. And a form of negative empowerment is to advance the stereotype of one gender being superior. Which the idea of "Women are smart, men are dumb" falls into quite adeptly. However. As I said, I moved away from that theory because negative empowerment isn't about creating strong people. It's about weak people cutting others down so they look strong.
