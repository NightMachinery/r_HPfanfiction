I started on Quotev, reading Hunger Games and Celebrity fanfiction. I eventually was told about wattpad and started reading Harry Potter fanfiction on there, which eventually led me to ffn and AO3.


** My sibling.... used to email me chapters to proof read. I read only their chapters for at least a few years. Eventually, though I don't remember when, I started reading fan fiction online. We don't talk anymore and recently I've been trying very hard to find their work online lately. I still have a few of their chapters on my computer, and I remember some of their favourite fics (so I can look for authors who favourited those), and have found an account of theirs, but it doesn't seem to have much of the stuff I remember reading over, and definitely doesn't have the works I have random chapters of saved onto my computer. Bums me out.

** I got my start in 2002 writing Star Trek fanfiction, only I didn't know it was called "fanfiction" at the time because I was seven years old. An episode of /Star Trek: Voyager/ pissed me off for some reason and I took it upon myself to fix it. Then I just kind of...kept going. I never put anything online, but I did a lot of reading on ffn. I didn't really migrate over to AO3 until 2016/2017.

Now I'm in my 20s and I have a degree in creative writing. My main focus in college was science fiction. I'm stuck in quarantine and have been rewriting a Harry Potter fanfiction a college acquaintance wrote ten years ago (though it may never see the light of day) because I just can't with my novel right now.

It's occurred to me to try Wattpad or tumblr or something to try to get more interaction with the greater community, but at some point I think more accounts than I already have might drive me insane...

** It started with my mother, who wrote a ton of fanfictions on LiveJournal when I was maybe 5. I then wrote a "fanfiction" on a forum, which was really me using consenting forumers in an original story. When I was 14, my friend (now girlfriend) and a couple of my other friends showing me their Wattpad fanfictions. Eventually, I went into the ffn Pokemon fandom and wrote 2 stories there (now deleted due to a ton of drama in that fandom) and wrote a one-shot on this fandom on fn. The Danganronpa fandom got me into A03 and the Worm fandom got me into both Spacebattles and SufficientVelocity. Now, I am here.

** I haven't been reading fanfiction for long, I was looking for something to help me cope after watching Avenger: Infinity War at the movies. My all time favourite superhero has always been Spider-Man, and I was bawling my eyes out at the end of that movie. I'm not kidding, a friend of mine who had seen the movie one time before actually turned towards me and started filming me, in the movie theater, because she knew I would start crying.. Anyway, I needed something, and lo and behold; there's so much fanfiction out there!!!! So much Peter fluff, so much irondad, so much lovelylovely feels and people who wrote to make themself feel better and therefor made me better to.

Heck, finding fanfiction probably saved me from hitting an all time low in my depression.

** Livejournal. Some forums that probably don't exist anymore that shared links. Yahoo groups. The early 2000's were a confusing place for fanfiction. Between drama, livejournal navigation, and dialup internet.

Dialup was the real clincher. Sometimes people would spam pictures all over their livejournal, and then you are stuck loading forever.

**** AOL for me. We had a second phoneline on the house that was "disconnected". It still worked, but the phone company didn't want to admit that. So free phone line. Used that for 24/7 internet access without sacrificing the phone. Email and instant messaging was so much better with a forever online modem.

In fact, that line is still active as of three months ago. We don't even use that company for our phone anymore either.

I unironically used netzero about five or so years ago. Had to house-sit my brother's new house while the contractors were working and the internet went out alongside bad phone reception. I used the dialup modem on my brother's really old laptop to google the number for takeout and print something.

I followed a fire emblem fic over to a03, in which I found my favorite fic of all time (Ebbot's Wake) an undertale slice of life fic. Which leaf to the fanfic paridice discord group, which lead to one of an undertale/Harry potter fic, which rekindled my interest in crossover fics. Which lead to me looking into SomniumOfLight's MajickeEstPoteaste (Artemis fowl/Undertale), TheZorker's ffn only Harry potter/Undertale fic (years 3-5 work in progress, updating slowly), and Under The Veil, an Undertale/Harry Potter crossover fic, a tine travel fic where once sirius falls through the veil, he gets sucked into the void, runs into sans whoose stuck there due to /spoilers/ upom which sans teleports them into the hp universe, and back in time to that one time that harry got swarmed by dementors at school, with the mission of killing voldy with limited knowledge of the future.

** In high school, circa 2011, I was going through TIME magazine to make a collage for art class, and it had an article about /Harry Potter/ fanfiction in it. At the time, I had no idea what fanfiction was, but I was keen on reading anything about /Harry Potter/. I don't remember much about the article now, but it included several fic recs, which I later looked up and read at home. One was Harry/Draco, one James/Lily, one Scorpius/Rose, and one Lupin-centric. None were particularly to my taste, and at the time it didn't occur to me to search for fic that was, so that was it for a while.

But then a few months later I got very, very invested in /Glee/, and eventually realized, "hey, I bet there's fanfiction for this, too," and made my way back to FFN.net. Haven't climbed out of the fanfiction hole since.

** I've started relatively late, in 2014 or so. I saw a post on 9GAG saying something about "what if Harry was sorted in Slytherin" and someone on the com section said"Better be Slytherin!" (I'm not from an English-speaking country, so I didn't know this quote was from the Hat, actually). Curious, I searched for it and stumbled upon /Better be Slytherin/ by jharad17 (which is a good Severitus fic, but a quite sad one) on ffn. And since then, I'm still exploring mostly HP, but I did branch out a little for crossovers and Zootopia, My Hero Academia or Zelda BoTW fics.

** Oh boy, this is a good one.

My first exposure was around 2005 on--if you can believe it--Nickelodeon's website. Avatar: The Last Airbender had a small forum on Nick dedicated to fanfiction and I fell in LOVE. It was SO clunky and SO slow, but I had such a blast reading those frankly horrible fanfiction (I mean, it was Nickelodeon and you had a word limit and there was no way to keep chapters continuous except by replying to the same topic thread--it was a mess but lovely).

From there, I branched out and discovered ffn which quickly became my home grounds for many truly terrible fanfictions--from Avatar to iCarly to Warriors (those cat books which I still think are dope). I stayed with those fandoms til about 2012 where I took a break. Surprisingly, I didn't even get into Harry Potter fanfiction until 2016, and that's when I found AO3, which is my preferred site nowadays.

But yeah, Nickelodeon introduced me to fanfiction. Who would've thought?

** I started on Quotev because my friend made a Harry Potter sorting hat quiz. I quickly dived into the fanfiction on the site (briefly starting with 1D 🙃 and quickly moving to Harry Potter).

After a while on Quotev I moved to ffnet and Wattpad.

After a few years of reading, I discovered AO3, which is now my favorite site.

Starting out on Quotev definitely made me more willing to spend time searching for fics, as thé search tools are abysmal and it is really hard to specify what you want. Wattpad is the same, and there is no real way to tell length as it based on how many chapters.

Ffnet and AO3 are my personal favorites, and have a wide range of content.

** I was in a pretty dark place, my dad was put into hospital and was in critical condition. I was having a rough time and started distancing myself from my friends and family. I got absorbed into Harry Potter, loved the movies and the feeling they gave me, after enough rewatching them, I kinda needed more, I wanted more, so I was browsing YouTube and found those shitty Harry Potter youtube fan fictions that are like slide shows. Loved it I realize how terrible they are now from story to writing to all the tropes but this was all new to me, I discovered ,know idea how, fan fiction.net and at first I was pretty hesitant, was never a fan of reading before life hit the shitter, but I said fuck it, and loved it, they were better written than the youtube slideshows and all these tropes and cliches were all new and as time went on I went through all the stages Dumbledore bashing, Weasley bashing, poorly written Slytherin Harry and slowly the quality of what I was reading improved. I now love self inserts and have fallen for game of thrones, and actually read real published books. Fanfic showed me a whole new world and allowed me to get absorbed and deal with my grief through it. I ve started to leave the cocoon I drove myself in, and started interacting with civilization. I still read Fan fiction and am on the grind for quality fan fiction, which is where half the time goes now days, I feel like you guys know what I'm saying. Ignore the terrible grammar I'm typing with my phone which is a lot harder for me than a keyboard.

Edit: I didn't really talk about me branching from Fanfiction.net, I did, I discovered AO3 around 2017 and space battles , alternate history and sufficient velocity in 2018

** I don't remember where I first saw HPMOR being discussed, probably on [[/r/harrypotter]]. I read the first half or so and stopped because its low quality eventually outweighed my interest, but it was already too late; my only prior experience was My Immortal, and HPMOR showed that not all fanfic is unreadable trash. I was now open to the idea of fanfic, but I wasn't quite trustworthy of Harry Potter yet, so I decided to look into Undertale, which had recently become popular. Six months later, all the good ideas were gone and most of the fandom was just writing SI x Sans and increasingly bizarre AU's, so I decided to return to Harry Potter to see if there was anything good and got sucked to the point where I'm still here four years later.

Currently, I mainly read Harry Potter, but I still go back to the Undertale and Life is Strange S1 (which also died) communities every few months to see if anything good has come out. I've also been reading Yuuri on Ice, but they're dying and desperately need a second season, so I'm not sure how much longer I can keep finding good fic from it.

****** I actually went back and finished it out of curiosity about a year ago, and honestly, you're not missing much. The lead-up to the ending was just more of the same, and the ending itself is so bad that one of the top posts on [[/r/hpmor]] theorizes that, essentially, Quirrel ate powder that makes you dumb/drank dumb idiot juice/haha peepee poopoo during chapter 110, hence his erratic behavior. When your own community headcanons that your story has in-universe Idiot Ball, you know you've fucked up.

Edit: Almost forgot, one of the other popular theories is that everything from chapter 110 on happens in Harry's and Quirrel's collective imagination, which is also ridiculous.

** I don't even remember the name of the website, but I started with Stargate and Star Wars fics (adding Buffy to my repertoire shortly after that). I mostly read crossovers (both then and now) so it didn't take long before I started jumping into every fandom that I had even vague knowledge of the source material. This was before AO3 was a thing so I was mostly using TTH and FFN.

** I was really bored one day, so I just typed in Katniss (I had just read The Hunger Games) then some search predictions came up. katniss breaks peeta's heart, katniss is tortured instead of peeta. I was very interested so clicked on it. Led me to ffn, from then on I was obsessed with fanfiction.

** The first I ever heard of fanfic was when I was ten years old and looking for information about the next Inheritance Cycle book, read some fanfic called "Brisingr" and thought someone had leaked the third book before I looked up what "fanfiction" was.

In high school I occasionally read some Hunger Games revamps and a bit of Inheritance Cycle AU fanfic for nostalgia's sake and out of a desire to read some free trashy literature. It wasn't much though, maybe I read 5 or 6 fics in total.

One day in college I wondered on a whim "are there any American stories in the HP world?" and came across Alexandra Quick. Discovering that series (still my favorite) lead to an explosion where HPFF was my primary reading entertainment for about a year. Nowadays it's faded and I read around one fic every month or two, if anything. I just don't have the time anymore to tiresomely shift through FFN for a quality story, and my tastes have just changed a lot.

** I remember reading fanfictions in every fandom I got into BUT Harry Potter. But then I read a drarry story or something because the plot sounded very much to my liking and it spiralled quickly into me discovering big fanfiction cites and falling so deep into Harry Potter that it's the longest fandom I've ever been in.

** A couple years ago, I looked over at my brother's computer screen and saw him reading some Naruto fanfiction (can't remember what it was called) on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] and I decided to check the website out. Having just finished Naruto Shippuden, I started reading Naruto fanfiction voraciously, eventually taking up several hours a day (I think the first ever fanfic I read was a trashy powerwank Naruto harem fic that got taken down from ffnet for having explicit sex scenes). I started venturing into the Harry Potter fandom after I had read most of the decent fics in the Naruto fandom (within the first ten pages) that interested me.

It is my great sorrow that I admit that my first Harry Potter fanfiction I read was Harry Crow...

Nonetheless I continued, and now I am here, an avid reader of the HP fandom.

** My high school friend introduced me to fanfiction.net, to Harry Potter fics, and to Drarry (my very first pairing). This happened in 2012, FYI.

Pretty soon I got hooked with the numerous stories I found (both completed and WIP). And the rest, as everyone has said, is history.

P.S.: I still read fics though (but the sites I've been using are Ao3, Fanfiction.net, and Wattpad) and I don't intend to stop, in my honest opinion. I don't stay with that pairing though (Drarry I mean), and universe (Harry Potter). I branched out to Percy Jackson, Avengers and some of the anime I watched. I even tried reading fics made by fans of some bands (that I will not mention haha).

Honestly though, I find utter satisfaction in finishing up a good fic (with a good plotline and pairings that makes sense to me). And a fic that has been completed. This is probably a reason why I couldn't stop reading fics.

** My introduction to fanfiction was really strange. I had finished watching some youtube videos and I couldn't find anything interesting until I came upon the old HP and the ticking noise video. I watched it out of nostalgia and decided to read the books again. I didnt really enjoy them as much as I had so stopped halfway through the second one and convinced myself I could find something better online to read. I came upon AO3 after a few searches for wizard based books and I started to read Core Threads by theaceoffire. From there I searched for different ideas. I've read all the cliche gringotts, harem, all powerful, manipulative!dumbles, weasley bashing stories and then moved on to snarry and tomarry. That lead to my reading grey!harry and Dark!harry as well as harry has a marrage contract stories. I think I'm going to read core threads again.

*** On Wattpad there is a book called Threads by ELatimer. It's not a fan fiction but it has a really interesting Magic system. And it's got to be one of my favorite books I've ever read. Magic is threads but it's not inside them it's all around them and in the world and they have to weave it together. It is also part of a trilogy.

** Maybe 4 years or so ago I started reading light novels online after I stopped wanting to spend money on books. I went from site to site and ended up reading them on a website that also had fanfiction on it. Read my first one maybe 2 years ago and have been since.

** I would assume via TVTropes. I can't think of any other context in which I might have come across HPMOR... I don't recall looking for fanfiction at any point in time. It's possible I was looking for something Bayesian but I think HPMOR came first, Bayes second.

And then, more recently, I was bored and wanted something to read so I went looking for it.

There were occasional dalliances in between or tacked on to the end of HPMOR because I'd definitely read a few other fics like Seventh Horcrux before. It's also possible I read them at the same time as HPMOR but I don't think so.

EDIT: if you want to call the Redwall Online Community fanfic... 2006 when we got the internet again.

** The first HP fanfiction I read was on LiveJournal in early 2003, IIRC. I got into the HP fandom that way, and also via Crack Van recs. But BtVS was my first online fandom in 2000, via message boards and Yahoo groups. Going back farther, I read Star Trek (TOS) fanzines found in garage sales, dating to the late 70s. Of course, Trek was my first media fandom since a child, but I did like Battlestar Galactic and Star Wars back in the day. Plus, comics reader since I could read, so a DC fan first. Then X-Men in the 80s.
