** The biggest flaw with these type of stories is that Harry is always right. He's the only one who can act according to logic, the only one who can acces and use obscure magics. Only he understands the inner workings of politics - he can get away with nearly anything due to the incompetence of those around him.

Centuries or millenia of studies by wizards and witches are made obsolete by Harry with his few years of magical teaching.

So, the mistake is that the only way Independant Harry works is by making everyone around him incompetent.

The good stories have capable antagonists, allies/friends, and other characters. Actions are based upon individual motivations that make sense to the ones that act them out.

A good writer can make the actions of those that go against Harry's desires understandable without cheaply bashing one-dimensional characters.
