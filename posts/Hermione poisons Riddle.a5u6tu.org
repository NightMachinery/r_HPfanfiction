Looking for a fairly short fix in which Hermione goes back in time and eventually poisons Tom Riddle after he kills Myrtle?


** Was it Murder Splits the Soul maybe? Linkffn(9400342)

A decent shortfic I quite enjoyed. Definitely one of the better short time travel fics.

#+begin_quote
  Hermione Granger, with her world in shambles, decides to pay Tom Riddle a visit in the past. After all, he is the root of all evil. It is a mission that drives Hermione on and she will do whatever it takes to see that mission accomplished. Riddle, though, wouldn't be a Dark Lord in the making if he didn't spot something suspicous in the new girl at Hogwart.
