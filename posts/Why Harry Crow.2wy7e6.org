So Harry Crow is one of the most reviewed, favorited, and followed stories on HP, and I was looking for a new thing. So I tried reading it.

I closed the tab when Harry proved himself better than McGonagall at Transfiguration in his very first lesson. I assumed every other lesson would be the same thing.

So I have two questions. Does Harry Crow get much, much better later on? And if not... what the fuck?


** You mean you didn't close out when Harry was introduced to a swooning Hermione as a diamond-earring studded, cravat-wearing, dashing 11 year old? Huh.

Short answer: no.

Long answer: nooooooooooooooooo.

#+begin_quote
  And if not... what the fuck?
#+end_quote

It looks like it was a straight (if awkward) Jane-Austen-styled HP power fantasy fanfic at first. I think maybe robst had also read the MUCH better [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6769957/1/Harry-amidst-the-Vaults-of-Stone][Harry amidst the Vaults of Stone]] (Published: Feb 23, 2011) at some point, as well. (BTW -- Harry Crow, Published: Jun 5, 2012.)

It went even further off the rails when it got really popular, I think. More and bigger became the watchword and it had less and less to do with the original characterizations, plot, and world (and canon). And then it went on. And on. And on.

Now Harry Crow isn't /poorly/ written, it just isn't well plotted and has terrible characterization, in my opinion. That's why I dropped it shortly after Dumbledore started shitting himself, losing political battles against an eleven-year-old.

I feel now I should have stopped earlier.

It's really odd. I think robst knew what he was doing the whole way. I just don't like the results. Some of his other stories are readable, but there's also some really questionable content there too.

** I love all of robst's work. But then, I read fanfics for the same reasons I think some people watch reality TV: I want to know exactly what I'm getting, get exactly what I want, feel good, laugh, and turn off my brain. If I want to learn something new, I'll read a new book, in a new world, with new characters. This is why I never review any of the fics I read; I'm not particularly good at reviewing, and the reason I read things isn't because they're objectively good, it's because I enjoy the heck out of them. Thus, my personal taste runs to crackfic, humour, godfic, etc. If that's not your taste, fair enough. I think even the briefest of glances at any of Robst's work make it quite clear what you're in for, so if that's not what you want, you can avoid it. No need at all to put down those of us who are obviously looking for something different from yourself, or come to fanfic for different reasons than you might. All of the fanfic archives have communities for every kind of theme and genre, and really advanced filters to let you ignore anything you don't want to read. Personally, I have absolutely no interest in slashfic, and almost no interest in erotic fanfic of any kind. It doesn't make the authors of that stuff bad writers, or the people who read it tasteless. I use filters to avoid it, and so have no need to complain.

**** Yeah, I know I've read it. It's been a while though, so I don't think I could give an accurate synopsis. If you've read one Robst story, you've read them all. It's always Harry/Hermione shipping, with more-or-less evil or misguided Dumbledore, more-or-less misguided or evil Ron, where everything ends up turning out perfectly for smart and super powered Harry. If you read your first Robst story and thought "Wow! That was fun! And I quite agree with some of the ways he portrays these characters!" then you should immediately stop what you're doing, and read every single one of his other stories. I fall pretty firmly into this camp. If your reaction to your first Robst story, on the other hand, was "yuck!" then just don't bother even trying any more. Why would you put yourself through that? So much other fanfic exists that you'll probably like better.

So I guess my advice is: pick one robst story, and finish it. If you still don't get it, just ignore his existence, and move on to other things you'll like better.

** I followed /Harry Crow/ for a while, initially as a guilty pleasure, then to satisfy my morbid curiosity. (The premise itself isn't bad; others have linked /Harry Amidst the Vaults of Stone/, which is a very good read, though it hasn't been updated in a long time.)

But, in the end, the sheer /banality/ of it got to me. I found myself skimming through the chapters on my e-reader when they came in, then skipping them altogether.

There is a number of trainwrecks that I followed and follow for amusement, but this one isn't a trainwreck. This metaphorical train is in perfect repair, going, at an impressive speed, /absolutely nowhere/.

--------------

*Edit:* To actually answer the question, I can see the appeal. It's a feel-good Harmony fic with no real conflict, where good things happen to good people, bad things happen to bad people, and all children are above average.

I just finished it.

I read each and every word up until chapter 78, at which point I started skimming.

There was no real conflict and no real trial.

I got bored and after reading voldemorts death scene, I gave up and didn't read the final chapter.

I to believe that I continued the story due to morbid curiosity.

** Personally I think it's a good idea that's got out of hand.

I like the idea of a goblin raised, politically shrewd Harry who's out to sort out some of the wizard world's glaring problems.

I don't like:

Vernon Dursley somehow finding his way to Gringotts.

Soul bonds.

The Potters were UBER rich. I'd expect they were Malfoy level in canon. But not Bill Gates level.

Use of the word 'mate' to refer to someone's partner.

** I feel like the majority of people in fandom have certain tropes or cliches they like in a fic and then go searching for those types of fics. I only got through a few chapters, but I imagine there's some people who like the over-powered, wish fulfilment aspect of it. I remember when I was 14 and first started reading fics I'd gravitate to any Mary-Sueish OFC wish fulfilment fics that were decently written and most people usually HATE those. Harry Crow probably hits enough favourite tropes, it's readable, long and complete.

** It's cliched to the gills but for me the biggest issue was the school years up 3-4 were 60+ (maybe even 70+) chapters in a 100+ (but way less than 120 thankfully) chapter story.

That's an insane amount of chapters to cover those years and then roll through the other half in 40 chapters or less.

  Are you seriously comparing Harry Crow to The Lie I've lived and A Black Comedy?
#+end_quote

Why not? They're all readable, but not brilliant. They're all about a overpowered hero who basically plays the world as he sees fit.

/A Black Comedy/ made me actually laugh out loud a couple of times or three, but always because of something that was said and not because of what happened. Then there was the whole “Haha, Remus, you pedo. In a world outside of your control you knocked up Tonks.” Hilarious.

It's been a while since I read /The Lie I've Lived/, but it's Harry, James, the Tri-Wizard-Tournament and a sarcastic Sorting Hat, right?

Harry Crow is kind of shit, but so are the other two. Goblin Harry with his own amusement park (that did happen, didn't it?) is stupid, but so is Harry with invisible Doc-Ock-Arms.

You can think of Harry Crow what you want, but at the very least it's not as boring as /To Shape and Change/, so there's that.
