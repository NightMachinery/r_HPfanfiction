So what are the best fanfictions you've read that you can recommend to everyone?

My top ten are:

linkffn(Eternal Return); One of my two favourite stories ever, Harry wakes up in the past as Tom Riddle and *bad things happen to wizards who meddle with time*.

linkao3(dead things); My other all-time favourite story, Harry can't cope with losing the horcrux (and with that a piece of his being).

linkffn(Unatoned); Probably the most realistic Harry/Daphne, where Auror!Harry is disillusioned with the ministry and starts one last case he shouldn't have.

linkffn(Magicks of the Arcane); A fanfiction that plays with the more powerful wizards and an interesting view on magic, gets a bit crazy at the end. Starts during GoF. Bonus point for mentor!Dumbledore, genuinely forgot if there is a pairing for Harry though.

linkffn(Basilisk-born); Still ongoing, a few tropes a bit overblown, but a good long time travel story with lots of unique ideas and magic, you probably know this one. Starts at the beginning of OotP.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time); You should definitely know *this one*. Crazy story, but unique and I still can't get *Hey Jude* out of my head.

linkffn(The Valley of the Kings Massacre); Took me a long time to find this gem, featuring CurseBreaker!Harry in Egypt and the origin of Horcruxes. minor Harry/Tracey, don't let this bother you

linkffn(Time to Spare); An older story, but it checks out. No pairings, postHBP Harry and Draco have to get new identities in the past to cycle back to the present. A bit crazy at the end if I remember correctly, but otherwise a really good read.

linkffn(The Unforgiving Minute); Harry has only 12 hours to fix the past and will do what he has to, only future pairings, can be ignored for the main part of the story.

linkffn(By the Divining Light); Dumbledore and Harry go on a crazy adventure, mentor!Dumbledore and a unique spin on magic, no pairings.

​

Now I hope you haven't read all of them yet and find one you like. Personally I am desperately searching for good fics at the moment, so...

#+begin_quote
  When the war takes a turn for the worse, Remus Lupin decides to fix everything by De-Aging Hermione and throwing her into the past. With Harry Potter dead, and Hermione in emotional pain, can her growing up in the Marauder's era change the outcome of the war forever? Or will everyone just have more to lose?

  Harry looks vaguely nervous, scratching the back of his neck. “It's a really long story,” he says finally, almost apologetically, “and it's really hard to believe.”“Try me,” Regulus says, more than a little daringly.

  Kreacher goes back to save his master, and Regulus survives but his near-death-by-Inferi puts him into a coma for the next sixteen years. When he wakes, well, the world is not so different. Voldemort is still at large, and the Ministry is still inept. His brother's got a godson now though, so it's only natural for Regulus to keep an eye on young Harry as well.

  When Sirius ran away from home he went to live with the Potters, but before he made it there he wound up lost, alone, and hurt in Muggle London. With James out of the country, Peter stuck at home, and Remus trapped by the full moon, it's Lily Evans (who hates his guts) that Sirius is forced to turn to for shelter and more advice than he could have bargained for.

** Two fics spring to mind, the first a recent rec I saw on another thread and the second, first in a so far 4-part series boasting 226k words.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20049589][Evitative]] - by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Vichan/pseuds/Vichan][Vichan]]

#+begin_quote
  In the summer before his fifth year at Hogwarts, Harry is drawn to a room in Grimmauld Place. Like the Gryffindor he is, he enters the room without fear. The room is a library, and Harry is surprised to find that he's eager to learn.

  Then he gets the bad news: he's been accidentally expelled from Hogwarts, and he needs to be sorted again. Everyone is confident that he'll go straight back to Gryffindor, but with what he's been learning, Harry's not so sure.
#+end_quote

~complete, 222k resorted!Harry and a decent go at actual teenagers.

  They don't question why Hermione Granger is able to cast every spell in the first class, or why she seems to know Hogwarts: A History by heart. They never really notice her resourcefulness, determination or cunning. A Gryffindor meant for Ravenclaw, they call her- and yet...Who would've thought that once upon a time, her name was Salazar?

  Severus Snape has his emotions in check. He knows that he experiences anger and self-loathing and a bitter yearning, and that he rarely deviates from that spectrum... Until the first-year Luna Lovegood arrives to his class wearing a wreath of baby's breath. Over the next six years, an odd friendship grows between the two, and Snape is not sure how he feels about any of it.

** Hmm...looking for a fanfiction that can be recommended to /everyone/ is a hard ask, since different people like such different things.

I do, however, tend to recommend that everyone try out Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality to decide whether they like it. Not everyone does, and that's fine, but it gets mentioned often enough, and has been influential enough, that it's worth making up your own mind. The expanded (and IMO improved) introduction is linkffn(Daystar's Remix of HPMoR).

Pros:

- Complete
- Funny
- Thought-provoking
- Very few typos
- Intelligent protagonist and antagonist
- Mistakes have consequences
- Whenever you see people debate it, which keeps happening, you'll know your own opinion.

Cons:

- Harry is arrogant and condescending to people he doesn't respect (which is most people).
- Several passages are basically author tracts; your mileage may vary depending on whether you find the subject matter interesting.
- Pacing can sometimes be off, better suited to the original serial release than to a complete book.

The story summary is ok, but I think a better one is in the author notes for chapter 22:

#+begin_quote
  /Something, somewhere, somewhen, must have happened differently.../

  PETUNIA EVANS married Michael Verres, a Professor of Biochemistry at Oxford.

  HARRY JAMES POTTER-EVANS-VERRES grew up in a house filled to the brim with books. He once bit a math teacher who didn't know what a logarithm was. He's read /Godel, Escher, Bach/ and /Judgment Under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases/ and volume one of /The Feynman Lectures on Physics./ And despite what everyone who's met him seems to fear, he doesn't want to become the next Dark Lord. He was raised better than that. He wants to discover the laws of magic and become a god.

  HERMIONE GRANGER is doing better than him in every class except broomstick riding.

  DRACO MALFOY is exactly what you would expect an eleven-year-old boy to be like if Darth Vader were his doting father.

  PROFESSOR QUIRRELL is living his lifelong dream of teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts, or as he prefers to call his class, Battle Magic. His students are all wondering what's going to go wrong with the Defense Professor this time.

  DUMBLEDORE is either insane, or playing some vastly deeper game which involved setting fire to a chicken.

  DEPUTY HEADMISTRESS MINERVA MCGONAGALL needs to go off somewhere private and scream for a while.

  Presenting:

  HARRY POTTER AND THE METHODS OF RATIONALITY

  You ain't guessin' where this one's going.
#+end_quote

Edit: And, predictably enough, mentioning this story attracts downvotes. That isn't good [[https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette][Reddiquette]], folks. If you disagree with something I say, then feel free to reply and tell me the problem. If you dislike a story that someone else likes, feel free not to read it (although note that I didn't say anyone ought to like this one, merely that it's worth being aware of it). But down-voting should be for posts that don't belong, eg off-topic, content-free, rule violations, etc.

  Fleur and Tonks' plans for the future get derailed. Now they are pulled into Harry's hunt for horcruxes. How will things go with an Auror and a trained Curse Breaker along? Rated M for language, mild violence, and sexual situations.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

  As his sixth year begins, Harry is forced to take up his destiny earlier that anticipated. With Voldemort slowly taking over, everyone looks to Harry to lead them, all while Juggling school, friends, the seach for the Horcruxes, and teenage love. In the process, Harry slowly learns about not only himself, but the true worth of the soul! Harry/Susan

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
