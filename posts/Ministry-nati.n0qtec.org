All of the bashers are right about Dumbledore.

But they're not.

Due to a stupid mistake in the past, Dumbledore found himself under some sort of magical compulsion, contract, or the like that he can't break. And so all the inconsistencies in the book that happened? All the bad things that happened like Harry being in a neglectful, maybe even abusive home? Happened because he's being controlled and he's trying his hardest to hint to Harry that something is wrong, but unable to do more.

Who's doing it? I lean towards the Ministry of Magic itself. There's a lot of signs in the books about how horribly corrupt it is. Perhaps wands are crutches and have become the norm because the Ministry wants to be able to sense and control magic, and wand magic is the only way they can do so. Perhaps some of the classes in Hogwarts are as bad as they are because the Ministry, Idiocracy-style, wants a stupid populace. Dumbledore's doing his best, but y'know.

Basically a subversion of the 'Evil Dumbledore' trope with some Ministry bashing (is that a thing, considering how bad the Ministry is shown to be in the books?) More of an Ministry-nati (ie, Illuminati) situation.


** I actually have a story I think you should read, OP. I read this story a long time ago, and it's more or less exactly what you're looking for. The magical world is ruled by petty bureaucrats and weak witches and wizards who use oaths and magical contracts to enslave the powerful, because they FEAR those powerful people. Dumbledore lost his free will the moment he accepted the Chief Warlock position, it was offered to him as a trap, because they were terrified of anyone strong enough to defeat Grindelwald. Dumbledore is 100% a master manipulator, who has be doing his very best to fight against a monstrous and corrupt system of weak and contemptable witches and wizards across the world who envy, lust after, and are terrified of true magical strength.

And when Harry casts a patronus that drives away 100 Dementors, and Lucius Malfoy resurrects the Triwizard Tournament, Dumbledore knows what's about to happen. The goblet, the oldest and most powerful artifact of binding in existence. Harry's name will go into it. They will enslave him too. They've realized that Harry is a rising power as well, and they have designs to debone and eat him as well, to put golden chains around his throat and have him serve at the feet of their governments and courts.

And Dumbledore will die before he lets them get away with it.

So he does the only thing he can do. He writes Harry a book, by hand, warning him of everything that's about to happen, and everything the magical governments can do to him if he accepts any oaths, jobs, or positions of power. He writes Harry a history book, and sends it to him via owl.

The rest is in Harry's hands. It's too late for Albus Dumbledore. But maybe it's not too late for Harry Potter.

And maybe, just maybe, if he's terribly clever. Harry might be able to turn the tables on them all.

This story left a really strong impression on me, so much so that I incorporated many aspects of it into that pet project that I'm sure we all have. The canon rewrite that you'll never get around to doing because it's just too big of a thing.

It made me imagine a much darker world of magic, where all history since the industrial revolution has been faked, because of course it has, magic is real, history can't possibly be what muggle historians say it is.

Both great wars were instigated to consolidate control over the mundane world. Grindelwald was a rebel who tried to fight, and failed, and in retaliation the magical governments were bound into servitude with magical contracts to their muggle counterparts: allowed the privilege to construct golden cages for themselves and pretend their great defeat was some noble victory for the dignity of wizardkind. Magical methods of control are used by muggle governments to drug and keep complacent the nonmagical populace, as part of their bargain with agreeing to keep the statute of secrecy.

Voldemort, a powderkeg rebel who sought to overcome death and become an unkillable revolutionary to topple the shadow government of the world no matter how many centuries it took, but who underestimated the consequences creating Horcruxes can have on sanity. Dumbledore, bound to servitude by the very "rewards" he was offered for defeating Grindelwald, only realizing too late that while they had both been wrong in their ways, that Dumbledore had been fighting for the wrong side.

And Dumbledore, at his most powerful and cunning but also at his weakest and most enslaved, vows to himself, after all the failures and pointless wars that have come and gone, and all the dead friends and lost students and regrets he carries, that one thing for certain will come to pass. Grindelwald may be locked away to die of old age, and Tom Riddle may have gone mad trying to become the monster the world didn't know it needed. And even the self-imagined princes and rulers of the world may be struggling to maintain their collapsing order in the face of rising anarchy and violence in the muggle world, as muggles begin to develop immunities and resistances to the enchantments and potions they have been over-exposed to.

But through it all, Albus Dumbledore swears this. Harry Potter will live to inherit the future. And he will be a free man when he does. No matter what price Dumbledore has to pay, no matter how much he has to make Harry hate him to sell the ruse. The boy he came to love like a grandson will live to inherit the sun.

That story, will probably never exist. Sorry. but if you want to know what inspired it, that would be /Knowledge Is Useful, But Power Is Power./ You should read it. I rather think you'll enjoy it.

*** I really like the premise of Knowledge is Useful, but Power is Power as well : as you said, a universe where the Magically powerful get bound by oaths to the whims of the ministry before they know better is a really good setting. But I found that after a while, it totally lost its appeal to me, as it was less about fighting the unfairness of this system, and more about random bits of impressive magic, and later on even arguing with magic, and higher entities themselves.

This is also the kind of setting that I find interesting, but in this specific story, I felt like the author had two superb ideas, but didn't explore any of them enough since he went from the first one to the second in the middle of the story, leaving me wanting more of what made me start reading it. Then again it's been a while since I read it, so my memory might be faulty, but I would really enjoy a story with the setting you described, without it changing track in the middle.

**** I would tend to agree with your assessment. The early half of Knowledge is very, very good. It may even be one of my favorite story premises that I've seen in the fandom. It's dark, and political, but feels canon compliant. Like this all could very well be true. It fits the Ministry as we know and understand it, it makes sense of the things we have seen of it. It is an explanation that solves more problems that it causes, and creates potential for new stories and new ideas to be built on top of it. It's a strong concept.

But the latter half of the story sort of falls apart. DisobedienceWriter outright admits that the original story was planned to end at about the halfway point, which is right when the genre shift happens, but then he wanted to add a few more chapters and expound on some ideas that had occurred to him while he was writing the original story. Personally, I feel like those ideas should have been a short story on their own, and not tacked onto Knowledge.

/Harry Potter Bargains With Avatars After Causing Problems While Trying To Solve Things/ doesn't really have a place in /The Magical World Is A Giant Conspiracy Of The Weak And Greedy To Enslave The Strong And Naïve./ That's two different ideas, and should be two very different stories.

That's part of the reason I incorporated what I liked about Knowledge into my own personal rewrite project. Every artist and writer is a thief at heart. We all read each other and draw inspiration from older things, and the chain goes back ten thousand years. I stole what I loved about Knowledge to change and mutate into something I found attractive, and left behind the bits I did not care for.

The base concept of Knowledge is that everything you know is a lie and that there's a massive conspiracy afoot involving magic and bad people who abuse it. I would rather use that as a jumping off point to explore other ideas, like scenario where a manipulative!Dumbledore is very much a good guy, and indeed may be the last 'good guy' left standing. Or a world where Voldemort trying to destroy the governments of the muggle AND magical worlds is actually /entirely justified/.

We know history in the Harry Potter universe has to be a lie, because magic is involved. There already have to be massive, crazy coverups in place to hide all the magical creature fossils and evidence of people riding dragons into battle during wars. That has to be a thing in canon. We even know for a fact that the magical and muggle governments must be cooperating to a degree at the highest level to maintain the statute of secrecy, because it would be impossible to keep otherwise.

It's not a very big step from that knowledge, which isn't true canon but can very easily be inferred, to supposing that the people maintaining this conspiracy who have all of this power and control... are abusing it. Horribly.

There's a story of a monstrous, dark, and dangerous Harry Potter universe that's only one inch to the left of canon, just waiting to be told. Could you keep Voldemort almost exactly the way he is, and yet still find him to stand in the right?

If the deck was shuffled properly, yes. I think perhaps you could. I think if you played the cards out well enough, Dumbledore, Grindelwald, and Voldemort could all be heroes who failed. And all three of them would have their own reasons to wish for Harry to succeed.

**** I can't go into detail as I'm at work, but I agree with this. Great start, but the latter half or so isn't my thing. Still an interesting story, though!
