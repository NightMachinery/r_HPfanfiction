I think a great OC (or OC-adjacent greatly expanded side character) can really make or break a fic.

People love to complain about annoyng self-inserts or superpowered plot device characters, but I want to highlight some OCs that are really well-done.

I love the characterization of Professor Vector in White Squirrel's Arithmancer series. She is a well-written female mentor for Hermione with her own backstory and motivations.

Likewise, I loved the teenage girl Adrian Pucey from a Slytherin!Harry fic (I'm blanking on the name here). She was firey and fun to read about.

Any other OCs I should know about?

** These two stories recently became my new favorite pieces of fanfiction: linkffn(2233473; 3353818)

It's an OC-centric fic about four Slytherins, and I think it's the gold standard for OC fics. The author did such a good job that I've grown to care (and worry) about all of them.

We have Tobias Grey, an intelligent, slightly high-strung half-blood wizard who doesn't know how to shut up in situations when he knows that he's right; Tanith Cole, a much more real-life version of the Daphne Greengrass trope (ice queen with a secret heart of gold); Cal Brynmor, a Quidditch-obsessed son of Death Eater parents who was raised by the Muggle-born Auror who jailed one and killed the other; and Gabriel Doyle, a pureblood wizard with a secret (I'll leave it at that).

**** I haven't read that fic in a long time (the author has stopped updating for some reason) and I am, by no means, a good judge of good stories, but for me, the appeal of Grow young with me, basically boiled down to - one, the fact that was my first fic with Harry (or for that matter, any other character) being paired with an OC; two, that the fic made a good story out of a realistic scenario of Harry losing Ginny in a freak accident and having to bring up three children all on his own, while dealing with his grief (admittedly, a common trope in fiction, but one that I hadn't seen being utilized in the Potterverse before) and finally three, the sheer plot possibilities of muggles getting to know about magic/vice-versa, although IMO Mugglefied did a far better job in this aspect.

  When he looked back on it later, Severus realized how much worse his life could have gone. Those few short months in 6th year were much more important than he could have ever known at the time. It was hard to have perspective on something like that at 16; constantly dodging hexes and being ignored by Lily Evans. The Professor had known, though. That's why he'd come. (AU, SS/LE)

This story is written to introduce an OC and remains fairly faithful to canon. Also, word of warning, Emma is a Vampire, so if that isn't your thing, perhaps you might want to avoid.

  The second book in Emma Pearson's story. This story is written to introduce an OC and remains fairly faithful to canon. If that, or vampires, aren't your thing, perhaps you might want to avoid. This isn't written to be a standalone book, so I recommend you read Emma Pearson - The Philosopher's Stone first.

** Black Jack Crowley from [[http://www.geocities.ws/heksie2144/alc.html][The Alchemists Cell]]. He's a criminal and bastard, but he's an interesting one.

In fact, I enjoyed many of the OC's in this fic: Edgar Bones (turns out to be alive), Fay (Edgar's muggle partner), Annie (a muggle friend Harry meets after running away), and the director of the play Harry ends up in. The later sequels had muggle military and police that I got attached to as well. I know people complain about the Hogwarts portions of this fic, but the muggle world section and OC's were fantastic.

** I loved Atlanta Black in the Rewritten in Time Series linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8601821/1/Regrets-Collect-Like-Old-Friends]])

​

My two favorites are definitely Bronson and Quigley from Cruel and Beautiful World by Lena Phoria. I've never gotten so emotionally attached to two OC's before and it is definitely a must read. No longer on [[https://fanfic.net][fanfic.net]] but you can google and find a couple pdf's of it floating around.

** Not from a fanfic, but I read a headcanon that Dean and Seamus end up adopting a muggleborn from an abusive family. His name was Raj and he was supposed to be the same age as James Sirius Potter.

I'm really smitten with the idea that Raj represents some of the flaws in the ministry that everyone is trying to fix and how he parallels Harry's situation, but Raj actually gets to leave his family.
