I'm trying to find this 3 part story where Harry is a man(boy) of science going into Hogwarts. He starts transforming his body and practices on Tonks cause of her metamorphmagus power and has this Frankenstein monster style bolt in his head.

Second one crosses over into Stargate etc.

Any help is appreciated, thanks

  Harry Potter wasn't raised like in canon. He was top of his class, and very intelligent, always seeking to improve things, and so he learned all kinds of things, and, upon entering Hogwarts, started studying all he could get his hands on! Intelligent!Super!Harry Later Mad Scientist!Harry Rated M for Language, Nudity, and Gore Stein-ish Harry Genres: Humor/Romance/slight Horror

  The sequel to ItMoaS. Mad scientist Harry Potter, now twenty years old, is sent to the SGC to half-join SG-1, accompanying them on missions. However, this job, which was just supposed to be providing Harry with research and allow him to expand on his knowledge, will have him make grand discoveries about himself and that of the entire magical race. Harry/Tonks/possibly more

***** [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enemy_at_the_Gates][Enemy at the Gates]] is a WWII war film that pits a Soviet sniper against the forces attacking Stalingrad. It's decent.
