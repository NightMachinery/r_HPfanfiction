Lily would verbally eviscerate the person who implied it, and James would cheer her on.

Dumbledore's not even mad. He's just very disappointed.

If Remus hears about this, you'll never see him again.

To quote the great philosopher Ron Weasley, that wouldn't be too bad.

Harry doesn't mind a good laugh.

And now Harry is back to contemplating suicide. Don't you know he has a saving-people-thing?
