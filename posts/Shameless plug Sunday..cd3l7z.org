  Alchemy is the art of permanently turning one element into another. That's something muggles can do, too. One-shot where Hermione kills Voldemort by nuking Malfoy Manor.

** !linkffn(Harry Potter and the Scrambled Sorting)

A humour fic with waaaaay too many PoVs where half of the students are in different houses. Currently in year 1. The main plot is still happening, but there's a ton of other things going on at the same time.

!linkffn(Departure from the Diary)

Slow burn Harry/fem!diary!Riddle. Diary Riddle tries to possess Harry at the end of CoS. Instead, she winds up stuck in his head, but able to take control of his body for brief periods of time. Harry has to deal with sharing his body and mind with a sociopath who doesn't care about anyone besides her pet basilisk.

#+begin_quote
  The houses of Hogwarts are growing stagnant, and a certain sentient Hat is dismayed over this turn of events. It decides to take matters into its own hands, taking advantage of several obscure rules to sort students where the Hat wants them, not where heredity or their own desires want them to be. The result? A mess that gradually pulls the student body into utter chaos.

  End of second year AU. fem!Riddle. Harry is fully prepared to face the basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets to save Ginny. Unfortunately, he never gets a chance. Tamelyn Riddle realises that killing one student and draining the soul of another would leave too much evidence of her return. Thankfully, there's another horcrux right in her reach that she can use to hitch a ride.

** I write stuff that could be classified as mugglewank, but I prefer the term "wizard-critical"--critical to wizards. There's also a bit of sci-fi there too.
