This has not been asked for a while, so I figured I'd see if people would be so kind as to toss their favorite FemSlash stories this way, Preferably something more than a sub 5000 word one shot.

** linkffn(Murder Most Horrid)

I don't think I've ever linked any story as much as this one. Great AU, believable romance, and some great smut scenes. Also the best Hermione/Bellatrix story.

**** No, he doesn't, apart from an occasional appearance, and the same goes for Ron and many others. I think that is one of the best parts of this story, canon characters are used only when necessary for the plot and it is in character for them to be involved(Lucius Malfoy, Narcissa and Andromeda appearances especially), and OCs are used to great effect. I didn't hate a single OC in this, except for one antagonist

  In a world where Voldemort never existed, Bellatrix Black is a cynical and dour detective working for the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, subdivision Magical Homicides. When she is tasked to solve a murder at Hogwarts, a certain resident genius called Hermione Granger happens to be her prime suspect. AU, Bellamione, liberal amounts of fluff.

There was also another one that was a Hermione/Ginny and Molly Weasley/McGonagall story that was great too. I also liked No Good Deed but that was removed it seems.

Everything else I've seen is a one-shot or two to three chapters at best. I'll add those if you want, just let me know.

*** [[http://fictionhunt.com/read/11756161/1][No Good Deed]] still lives on fictionhunt thankfully. I'm still rather salty about how the author just deleted the story without any warning a few weeks after promising us a quicker update.

** linkffn(Those Gilded Chains We Wear) a really great Bellatrix/Hermione story. Unfortunately the author is rather busy, so updates are scarce. As far as I know, the story isn't abandoned.

linkffn(Even Angels Have Their Dark Desires) Hermione gets sent into Azkaban for the Gringotts heist. Seems to be abandoned, but closed it's first story arc, so it works pretty well as it is.
