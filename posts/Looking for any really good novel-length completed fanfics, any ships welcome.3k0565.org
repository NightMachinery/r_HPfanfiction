I love reading novel-length fanfics but I've run out.

Particularly like stories about raising Harry - favorites include Dangerverse, Sacrifices arc, Stealing Harry verse.

Also enjoy things like Shoebox Project, Three Thousand Days of Innocence, etc.

Basically I'm looking for any long quality fanfics!


** So I havnt read any of those fics you mentioned so these three fics might of might not be well received by you

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4101650/1/Backward-With-Purpose-Part-I-Always-and-Always]])

This is part one of a completed multi part epic. This series has the distinction of being my favourite time travel fic and my favourite Harry/Ginny fic. There is some silly angstyness in the beginning but as the story progresses it explains exactly how necessary it was. There are many threads woven into this story.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5490079/1/The-Little-Veela-that-Could]])

This is my favourite Harry/Gabrielle -and Hermione but it's complicated- fic and its the only time I've ever been able to tolerate a god like Harry along with guns. Lots of world building in this one and a unique take on horcruxes that I've never seen used elsewhere. If nothing else the first chapter is more intense than any first chapter had a right to be.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10290899/1/Keep-This-Wolf]])

This is hands down my favourite Harry/Draco slash, featuring a werewolf Harry and a unspeakable Malfoy. Only one sex scene near the end with lots of build up without being sappy. Features my favourite Umbridge death in fannon.

Linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/951061/chapters/1859733]])

This is my favourite smut fic and my favourite ménage et Trio. Beware while everyone in this fic can be sympathized with no one is guiltless. Prepare to love and hate everyone.

All of these are long, completed and I had a great time reading them.

** I haven't read any of the flics you mentioned, but I'd like to recommend these anyway... My favorite fan fiction is a series of three stories, all very long, called Resonance, Revolution, and Resolution by GreenGecko. They are really fantastic, although the beginning of Resonance is a little iffy, it hits its stride fairly quickly. It is a Snape adopts Harry fic, but it happens when Harry is a teenager. It is really good, and the story covers several years and there's a lot of really cool action and magic. It's got a little bit overpowered!Harry and some dark!Harry, but it's very well done. It's last chapter is not done, but it is essentially over. I've read it through several times and never really feel awful about it's not being absolutely "finished" because I feel like the story was mostly wrapped up.

*** I second this recommendation, it's one I often recommend to people looking for something long and different.

OP, if you check my recent comment history, I gave someone else a brief rundown of the first story in spoilers. I felt like most of the really interesting stuff was in the 2nd and 3rd, but the first one does provide that necessary foundation and characterization.

Edit: [[http://www.reddit.com/r/hpfanfiction/comments/3jni02/best_dimensionhopping_fics/cus0iov][here]] is my comment, *spoiler* warning for the first story.

** Two pretty imaginative, yet fairly unknown fics I loved: linkao3(2679206) linkao3(438516)

Both stories feature a young, talented Harry, who is raised by interesting combinations.

/Warping Circumstances/ by Deritine has strong characterization and a unique Harry/Voldemort interaction. A favourite. Vaguely similar to /Seventh Horcrux/ by Emerald Ashes.

/Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them/ by evansentranced is also a fic you won't forget. The story is first in a series, and each installment builds on the fun.

  Harry gets sent back in time and across dimensions because... well, there doesn't really seem to be a reason why. Life is kind of awesome here.

  Harry is an elf. No, he's not a bloody house elf. He lived in a place where they had got him confused with a house elf for nearly six years. They had him doing all the chores and he slept in a cupboard. Not a particularly cheerful cupboard, either. But he's not a house elf. He's a regular elf, thank you. Come on, people. It's like you're not wizards or something. PreHogwarts, NOT a creature fic. Character study.
