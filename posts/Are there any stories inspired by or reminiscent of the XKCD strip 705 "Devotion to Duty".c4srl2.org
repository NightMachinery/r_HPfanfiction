I know, I know. I should just ask for stories like "Inspected By No 13" (aka Inspector 13), but hopefully the [[https://xkcd.com/705/][XKCD strip]] will inspire someone to remember something or even use XKCD as an inspiration source.

#+begin_quote
  When he learns that flying anywhere near a Dragon is a recipe for suicide, Harry tries a last minute change of tactics, one designed to use the power of the Bureaucracy forcing him to compete against itself. Little does he know that his solution is its own kind of trap.
