** The number of snakes in Surrey is grossly overestimated! And the type! There are four types of snake that are native to Britain and all of them are EXTREMELY RARE!! The number of times I've seen Harry gardening and oh look! A grass snake! Or an adder! (If it's a dark Harry fic) NO! Harry would not find a snake while gardening in suburban Surrey! The Dursley's do not live in a house that backs out onto f*cking moorland! I live in London; I walk in the Surrey hills; the only time I've ever seen evidence of a snake was when I was in DORSET on the SOUTH COAST! And he'd be far more likely to see a black adder when he was at Hogwarts; they live in the Highlands of Scotland and the Lake District, the likelihood of seeing one any further south than York is astronomically low. Sorry for the rant, it's one of those things that just really gets to me.

*** Oh no, don't worry. I get it. The whole purpose of this post was because I was fed up after coming across generally well-written stories that could have perfect had they not Americanized everything and thrown all respect for British speech out the window.

Snakes have played a pretty big role in the series, and especially in fics where Harry is more involved with them, you'd think the writers would set aside 5 minutes to do a quick search of the types found in Britain. But it appears many writers live in the pre-internet days.

**** Honestly, if many of the people who do this tried to make it more authentic, it would probably turn out worse. You can only get so far by looking up differences online. Like, I'm an American who's consumed a lot of British media. I can recognize many different accents/dialects, understand vocabulary differences and slang, etc. But I don't think I could write something that would convincingly pass as having been written by a native Brit, especially if I was trying to make all the characters accurate to the part of the UK they're from.

*** I didn't know they were that rare tbh. When I was younger and living in West London when we got to the point where we didn't cut our grass for 6 months to a year we would end up with snakes in the garden. There was one point where we finally cut the grass after a year of not doing it and we found 5 snakes cause we accidently killed them with the mower. And it's not like we lived in the countryside or anything this was in the suburbs of West London in Ealing.

******* At GCSE and A-level a letter grade would be A*-G. These represent UMS (uniform mark scale) chunks such as 100-90 = A* which is fixed from year to year, however the raw marks needed for the grade boundaries change according to the difficulty of the exam/assessment on a national scale.

This means that if an exam one year was deemed to be particularly challenging by the exam board, then a raw mark of 54/60 may correspond to 100/100 UMS. The following year with an easier exam you may need 60/60 for 100/100 UMS.

In this case you would receive an A* grade, with a raw mark of 54/60.

For class tests these are often made up of past exam questions (from a central database) or made up questions, and either way the raw mark to UMS isn't calculated and students would receive a mark of '54/60 = 90%' instead.

**** To quote another comment I made:

#+begin_quote
  Honestly, if I were writing it, I wouldn't include directions at all. British cities grew in a very sprawling fashion, and can be a bit confusing to navigate if you're not familiar with them. I think giving the travel time would probably suffice, since that gives a general idea of the distance travelled without having to describe numerous turns and street crossings, etc. Maybe include some landmarks like, say, a park the character passed, if you really want to flesh it out.

***** How about the use of boroughs? For example, below is a snippet of a story I'm currently writing:

Hermione laughed as she ducked her chin. She didn't know why but she suddenly felt rather embarrassed in front of this stranger. "Um, well, I guess you could say that. But I'm from originally from Britain. London, to be exact."\\
"London's a big place," Harry said, holding out his arms as if to show just how big it was.\\
"West Brompton," she said. "My mum and dad moved back there during the summer."\\
"So, pretty close to here? What is it, like a borough over?"

****** In that case, yes; that's a totally appropriate, but even then, it's not so much of a distance thing. Boroughs in London (born-and-bred Londoner, can't really speak for anywhere else) are not uniform, and (due to some pretty interesting history) many of them are some really really really wacky shapes. You'd never really use them to measure distance - for example parts of one borough might be 20miles across, and 2miles across at another part of the borough before widening again. Like I said, pretty whacky. I almost always measure in terms of time; it's an hour on the tube to central London, it's a 30 minute bus to the river, it's a 15 minute walk to the station

Or, perhaps, "So, pretty close to here? What is it, (n) minutes away by tube?" or "What is it, (n) of a mile?"

BTW, bear in mind the saying 'British people think a hundred miles is a long way and Americans think a hundred years is a long time.' Distances within London can be very close in miles and yet very 'far' in perception, depending on how straightforwardly they are connected, and that's largely true for the rest of the country too.

Like Seamus will say “Ah-ree Poh-ta” that's not even a little bit Irish, it's way more cockney. He would say it like how dumbledore says it in the GoF film after he reads Harry's name out (so out of character on Micheal Gambons part lol) other than that it's just lazy writing like when they say things like ‘mom', ‘trash', ‘ma'am', ‘dollars' (I mean really?)

Though now that I think about it more, I believe I got the prices of the books from old Pottermore or sth. Maybe a better comparison would be the Weasleys' trip to Egypt?

They won 700 galleons, and spend almost all of it on their vacation. So that's 700x25= £17500! I don't know about others, but I don't believe I've ever spent even a quarter of that on a trip (And that's with magical transportation, too!).

Meanwhile, a scoop of floo powder costs 2 sickles (about £3), and I assume that's several floo trips, as you only need a pinch (?). So even at its most expensive, a trip to anywhere in Britain is £3. What the hell did they do in Egypt to spend so much money? Sure, international travel is more expensive, and they had to pay for food and lodging, but still!

***** Vernon was able to get hold of a shotgun, while out somewhere rural, presumably from a /very/ dodgy friend, because what he did was not remotely legal, but with the rampant, obvious child abuse, the out-of-control son and his general demeanour, I'd guess he is used to bending the rules and got it from a Smeltings alumnus and old mate.

There was no sign he ever kept one in his suburban home, and it would be unusual if he did. Not unknown, and, as you say, not difficult, but unusual.

If he was rural, I'd expect him to have at least a shotgun.

*** I want to add that in the 1990s, Britain was an overwhelmingly white society, with 93% of the population being white and 5% Asian. Even today, after lots of immigration, white population still stands at 88%. In 1980, blacks made up less than 1% of the population, and that's the key reason I don't think a black Hermione is likely. Ethnicity wise, Britain is a very different place than California or Florida.

British population is far less religious than Americans on average. It's significantly more open in terms of sexuality. Age of consent is 16 years, and those complaining about years 6 and 7 characters shagging each other are silly IMO.

Legal drinking age in Britain is 18, and 16 accompanied by an adult.

That depends. I'm a native Floridian, was born and raised here my whole life, and it's safe to say South Florida is very diverse, while North Florida not so much. Of course, there's still plenty of different ethnicities in North Florida, but it's nowhere near as diverse as South Florida.

***** While technically the royal family are German, the only king recognisable as German was George the first of Hanover who ascended to the throne in 1714 - the subsequent monarchs have all been born in Britain. While the surname of Saxe-Coburg wasn't changed to Windsor until 1917, with the rise of anti-German sentiment in the wake of the First World War, I would think that 212 years is enough to firmly call someone British. Additionally, Elizabeth I, Tudor was even more certainly English, and her name was spelt with a ‘z'. And for anyone saying that Anne Bolyne was French, and that that might have had an impact, she wasn't; she lived in France, and spend time in the French Court, but she was born in England, and the Bolynes had been an established part of the English nobility for many years. In conclusion, I'd say spelling Elizabeth with an ‘s' is in fact far more uncommon than spelling it with a ‘z'. Good question tho. Thanks for letting me stretch my history muscles. :)

Not always.

You'd be more likely to use bathroom in a more formal conversation or to a teacher ("Please miss, can I go to the bathroom" vs "I'm going to nip to the loo"). Also there are places where the bathroom and the loo are different rooms (one is a toilet and the other has the sink and bath/shower), they're not standard but they're not uncommon.
