**** I read a post somewhere that summarised my feelings for it pretty nicely. I'll try to find it but mainly it's that harry becomes really capable overnight, while everyone else becomes incompetent and petty. Most of the characters are like day and night from their canon counterparts, a lot of harry's problems stem from him being too edgy and A LOT OF miscommunication, assumptions and misunderstanding. Like most if not all of the drama in that fic that could have been solved in a short conversation but it's drama for the sake of drama to the point where it's borderline ridiculous. Harry is competent and strong wizard in this fic and while that is ok in fanfiction, there's zero buildup or explanation as how he got to where he is other than 'I read the books over the summer'. It's a fic where you feel like you're missing the frist couple of chapters and now you have to deal with a Harry that genuinely thinks he's better than everyone and that only someone who he thinks is his equal deserves his attention.

***** *Cadmean victory*

A Cadmean victory (Greek: Kadmeia nike) is a reference to a victory involving one's own ruin, from Cadmus (Greek: Kadmos), the legendary founder of Thebes in Boeotia and the mythic bringer of script to Greece. On seeking to establish the city, Cadmus required water from a spring guarded by a water-dragon similar to the Lernaean Hydra. He sent his companions to slay the dragon, but they all perished. Although Cadmus eventually proved victorious, the victory cost the lives of those who were to benefit from the new settlement.

** At some point the Dangerverse became too far removed from canon for me in a way that did not feel like "this is an AU that could have happened in canon if things went just a bit different". - And I still continued to read the whole damn thing, because I started it,I had read it for years and damnit, I would see how it ended!

( also, looking back at the first few chapters alone, wow, this reads full of clishes, a main character who is precariously close to being a Mary Sue, and all in all like something I would ignore these days...back then, though? I just wanted a cute fix fic in which Harry gets a nice family who takes care of him...)

Danger is just a nickname, albeit one of those that stick forever to the point people know you by that name. - And, tbh, Danger /is/ better than Gertrude. Both my grandmothers are called variations of Gertrude, I cannot look at that name without thinking "old person" . ( it's actually kind of cute, though, that the author named "Danger" Gertrude. The idea was that the Granger parents had a Shakespeare theme going on with nameing their daughters, if I remember right.)

*** I read this but it was rather enjoyable more or less due to the parodical nature.

.... What do you mean it's not a parody???

**** Yeah if it had the same quality as Seventh Horcrux, it might have been great, but the writer just wasn't as good. It was mainly the insistence of using stupid names for Voldemort etc that completely rubbed me up the wrong way, with the bashing sealing the deal.

** I'd have to go with linkffn(The Problem With Purity) to be honest. I mean, I just wanted to know what happened at the end, you know? Well mainly I read to the end to see whether Hermione ever actually hexes Snape into tiny gooey pieces and leaves him to be alone and lonely forevermore the way he deserves (she didn't, it was a massive disappointment).

** Don't recall what it was called, but it was a fic where Harry would eventually turn into a girl. It was alright until it bashed Ron "subtly" for the 100th time. (Ron getting a new wand meant that his sub-par feats of magic became slightly less sub-par, for instance, and so on and so forth.)

** Французкая магия.

Jesus fucking Christ. OK, so Dumbledore's evil now. OK, so Harry talks with Fleur and then she gets him a private tutor/whatever. OK, some dark wizard's vampire wife removes Harry's horcrux. OK, so Sirius really gets into the Pureblood bullshit. And that's when I realized that the fanfic was garbage. I still continued to read it. Didn't get better one bit.

Russian fanfics are mostly dogshit.

Also, I really need to start translating English fics to Russian.
