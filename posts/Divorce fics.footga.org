Any fics where a divorce takes place. Doesn't matter if it's a main focus of the story or just one of many subplots as long as it isn't just mentioned in passing. I want some thoughts, dialogue, maybe even a court process.

Any pairing is ok -- Ginny leaving Harry for Luna or the other way around; Harry divorcing Daphne cause his ‘Slytherin stage' has passed; Ron getting tired of Hermione's righteousness; Hermione ditching Ron for Draco or ditching Draco cause he's a git after all; Molly and Arthur; James and Lily; whoever...

Amicable or not. Bashing is ok. The only thing I don't want to see is love/loyalty/doormat potions.


** I am still looking for the story where Harry & Ginny split over Lily being a squib and Ginny is not able to accept it. Does anybody know?

** Hmm... I know this really great one on AO3 in which Vernon and Petunia divorce. Actually I know two great ones. Maybe more... stupid memory. I'll try to find the links and post them.

** ... I've got no idea why I know so many of these. Not so much on the court process side, but pretty much all of them have a large chunk of the narrative devoted to the separation itself.

  A repost of four old HP fics of mine belonging to my incomplete "journals and ice-cream" series.1. Draco Malfoy and the Trials of Single Parenthood2. Draco Malfoy and the Perils of Dating3. Ronald Weasley and the Midlife Crises4. Lorcan Scamander and the Year of Raging HormonesDraco Malfoy and the Trials of Single Parenthood: Draco Malfoy: ex-Death Eater, former bigot, divorcee, and single father. His wife left him for Viktor Krum, his children worship the Weasleys who clash with the décor, something is rotten at Hogwarts, and he doesn't really know what he's doing. But maybe he's getting the hang of it.**PLEASE READ THE AUTHORS NOTES FIRST**

  Hermione Granger has just been appointed Minister of Magic and Draco Malfoy seizes the opportunity to placate rumors that Scorpius is the son of Voldemort. Instead of issuing a statement, though, Hermione decides to foster a friendship between Rose and Scorpius, leading her to have to spend more time with Draco, who she is surprised to learn has changed considerably in the years since the war.Begins in Summer 2017, right before the second generation starts at Hogwarts.

  Acceptance. That's all Scorpius needed to finally receive the comfort he desperately longed for during the ups and downs of his parents' relationship. one-shot.

  It's a year of change. Hugo is starting Hogwarts, Rose has made an interesting choice in friends, and Ron is...just the same as ever. Marriage, like most of life, isn't easy. Sometimes Hermione wonders if she and Ron just aren't meant to work. And Draco Malfoy sending her flowers isn't helping. Epilogue-compliant. Inspired by JK's comments about Hermione and Ron's compatibility.

  Death isn't easy, and Hermione is barely keeping herself afloat after Ron is gone. After an unlikely friendship between her kids and Draco Malfoy's son brews, something unlikely blossoms between Hermione and Draco too.
