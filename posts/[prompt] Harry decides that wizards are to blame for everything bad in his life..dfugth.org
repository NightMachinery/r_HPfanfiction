Harry learns about wizards early somehow, some over enthusiastic fan possibly, and realises something important: a wizard killed his parents. This line of thought continues. It was wizards that made him live with his abusive family. It's because of wizards that he has to sleep in a cupboard. And so on, and so forth.

Fast forward: Harry gets his Hogwarts letter. He sends a reply saying that he's not attending, but ends up being forced to attend (some legal thing possibly). Here's where the story really picks up, in my opinion, as Harry is forced to interact with a world he hates.

He meets Draco while out shopping. Draco makes some comment, painting himself as the kind of person all young wizards should emulate, that just solidifies Harry's dislike of wizards.

He meets Hermione on the train, and she's not too bad. Of course, she's muggleborn, not a proper wizard, so of course she's alright.

Probably dislikes Ron. Another pureblood, going on about his family, and houses, and all sorts of other things.

As to the classes? Harry puts in the lowest amount of effort he can. He has to be here, and he has to pass, but no one said he has to do /well/. He doesn't join the quiditch team, he refuses to have anything to do with a /wizard/ sport. On that note he can't even enjoy something mundane, like chess, because the wizards just had to make it "better".

And the teachers? Dislikes them to start, but that ramps right up when he learns that /these/ were the ones that put him with his aunt and uncle.

I also see Harry dressing in as close to muggle clothes as he can get away with, a silent protest against wizards.

Not evil Harry, not even Dark Harry, just a guy that's decided that all of the worst things to happen to him are because of wizards, and doesn't try and make it a secret.

These sorts of fics always have the main character, in this case Harry, "coming around" or "seeing that they're not that bad". And while that's a fine way to do this story, I've read and enjoyed that take before, I'm more interested in if he /doesn't/ "come around". Maybe he finds one or two purebloods he likes (I vote for Luna, if only because of my ship related bias), but that's it..


** I always though this would be a good direction to take the Dursley's treatment of him. They hate magic and wizards, so instead of hating Harry as well and blaming him, they teach him that magic is bad and that wizards are freaks.

It wouldn't be too hard. Lily and Petunia were best friends before Hogwarts. Then they stole Lily away from her family. Turned her against them. Married her off to a man she hated (Lily didn't like James for most of her school years until he grew up a bit, it would make sense that from Petunia's perspective she thought Lily still hated him but ended up sold off to him anyway because he's a pure blood) and finally got her killed in their war.

They can blame everything bad on the wizards and instead of lying and punishing Harry to try and suppress his magic they could convince him to never want to use it.

*** Interesting idea, if not quite what I was thinking, and it could be fun. Would make some interesting moments if he's forced to go to Hogwarts if he keeps trying to /not/ use magic.

My idea was more "I hate my aunt, uncle, and cousin because they're abusive people, and I hate wizards for putting me here in the first place". Harry hates wizards, but he doesn't have that much love for his family either.

** It might be interesting to have Harry as an anti-magic version of Tom Riddle. He makes friends with all of the muggleborn, who see the prejudice they face, and then slowly start exterminating pure bloods.

Anti-magic Harry doesn't care if he kills all the magicals that aren't muggleborn, while Voldemort has to care about not killing too many purebloods.

The story wouldn't have to be dark!Harry, unless you consider Malcom X to be dark!Martin Luther King Jr.

Instead of passively enduring the prejudices and tribulations of the magical world, Harry would strike against it. It would be violentlymurderous!woke!Harry. And in a depressingly large number of fanon versions of the wizarding world, the best thing to do would indeed be to tear it all down.

***** First off, nice write up, and you should definitely write that.

Second, while I find this an interesting angle, as I've mentioned before, it's not the itch that I'm after scratching just now. Exploring muggles view of wizards and mind wiping could make for an interesting, if probably dark, fic.

As to the "equality" thing, I'm not after equality between muggles and wizards, I'm not that naive. I just think that someone coming in with a established biased /against/ wizards would be disgusted that they are hording such useful abilities and items (IE: Skelegrow) for no good reason. And if I was after equality in Harry Potter it would be the muggleborn/muggleraised being equal to the purebloods. Throw in the magical creatures as well, just for kicks.

Take, for example, the most basic thing: Purebloods already have a /massive/ head start, knowing about magic since their born, and they can practice at home over the summer holidays. Muggleborns spend the first eleven years (or thereabouts) of their lives ignorant of magic, and then they don't get to practice at home because they'll get arrested (as nearly happens to Harry).

  In 1991, Harry Potter begins his time at Stonewall High, unaware that he is anything more than a boy prone to freakish accidents. When he turns fourteen, he will receive a letter that will change his life. He will learn he is Harry Potter, and be invited into a world where belonging is his birthright. Until then, he stumbles on, two steps forward and one step back, out of the cupboard and into the life he was never meant to have.

*** If a bit less murdery. My idea was more of a social thing, or an excuse to look at the wizarding world through the eyes of someone new to it that /isn't/ whimsically entranced by it all. Harry hates wizards, makes no secret about that fact, but doesn't want to kill people.

Harry being Reverse!Voldemort is kinda neat though.
