I just want to see what everybody else likes! I really like The Green Girl, Applied Cultural Anthropology Or, When Hermione Becomes Lethal, and Without Her Letter.


** linkffn(The Arithmancer) and its sequel linkffn(Lady Archimedes) have a Hermione whose talent at math translates to talent in arithmancy.

linkffn(Hermione Granger and the Perfectly Reasonable Explanation)'s description is accurate: "In 1991, a child came to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry with obvious gifts, but which few suspected would change the world... Oh, and Harry Potter enrolled that year as well."

linkffn(Amends, or Truth and Reconciliation): The best and most realistic post-war fanfic I know of. Killing Voldemort sometimes seems like the /easiest/ step to properly ending the war.

linkffn(The Muddy Princess): Hermione turns out to be a Pureblood. More about character interaction and wizarding culture than plot.

Edit: linkffn(Sin & Vice) is long and I've only just started, but it has an original concept and an interesting relationship between Hermione and Snape.

*** I second 'Sin and Vice', it is a bit wonky at points but really drives home a character that you, err, won't forget any time soon - I know that I have not... not in years...

*** Thank you for the rec of linkffn(Sin & Vice by Mak5258). The writing drew me in by the second chapter, and while I accept the super-sizing of Hermione in explanation, it's one of those 'but why wouldn't they do this for Harry or any number of other gifted students?' type of situations. Once you move past that, there's much to be enjoyed (63 chapters much, in fact).

**** Yeah, the special Time Turner requires suspension of disbelief even for a story with magic in it. Having one of those should be an automatic win. But regular Time Turners, Felix Felicis, the Fidelius charm, and so many other canon powers were under-exploited too, so I can ignore it.

  In her sixth year, Dumbledore makes Hermione a key figure in a plan to help Harry defeat Voldemort. (It's difficult to summarize this without spoilers--- HG/SS; there's a Time Turner involved but probably not how you expect; the story really gets started in Chapter Three.)

*** I read the whole muddy Princess today based on this suggestion. You're spot on about it being mostly about interaction and culture, which I found great, but I thought the D/H development a little too fast for my taste. It started so strong and then that picnic scene, I was like "... Meh" but also too invested to not finish it.

** My favorite Hermione fics are:

[[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm#pt][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]]: kick ass Hermione without being Mary Sue.

"A Little Child Shall Lead Them", linkffn(10871795): I just find it really cute how a 2 years old Hermione fixed up the world.

"Broken Chains", linkffn(7718942): I like this Hermione's unwavering love for Harry and her descent into the dark side.

"Stages of Hope", linkffn(6892925): This Hermione has my greatest sympathy, and I truly wish she and Harry can get together.

"The Dark Lord Never Died", linkffn(11773877): This fic is my favorite Hermione/Ron romance.

** I'll try to avoid stuff that has already been mentioned in this thread and apologize in advance for too much Hhr shipping.

A very interesting oneshot:

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5508237/1/Caveat-Inimici]])

Time-travel badass Hermione:

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4692717/1/Many-Thanks]])

A Hermione/Bellatrix sorta soul-bond fic, with a somewhat contrived setup, but I quite like Hermione in this. Even if she was in love with someone she wouldn't just abandon all reason and get together with the enemy.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7200246/1/Impossible]])

Not really a Hermione story, but probably one of the most authentic portrayals of how she might cope with a darker war-veteran Harry:

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10687059/7/Returning-to-the-Start]])

Hermione fixes Wizarding Britain as a 2 year old (time travel):
