I see some people try to justify it by saying it's a symbiotic relationship. Other's go the canon route and treat it like actual slavery. What do you think is the best explanation for it?


** They're basically [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownie_(folklore][Brownies]]). Like most fey, they don't think like humans and are firmly bound by certain rules (that often make little sense to humans).

To us, working as a bonded servant for no pay is slavery, but to them it is their dream lifestyle. In some cases, like Dobby's, that dream gets soured by a bad master just like a bad boss can ruin what would otherwise be our dream job. Getting clothes is like getting fired, evicted from your home, and disowned by your entire family in a single act - only people in a /really/ bad situation would want that.

*** But they are a twisted version of it, because brownies or Heinzelmännchen (as we call those house sprites in Germany) are proud and independent. They are not bound to anyone and leave if they don't feel respected or if they feel insulted. They expect payment for their services and see themselves not below the humans in the house

** They're slaves bonded to properties similar to serfs and forced to obey whoever owns the property they're bound to and socially conditioned to think freedom is bad and to punish themselves if they did something their master disapproves of.

Obviously the entire system is morally wrong, and should be abolished, though not at once since ta lot of the elves couldn't handle it without some therapy.

**** Honestly, the first problem would be to make wizards in general start seeing elves as people deserving rights and protection. Like we see with Dobby it doesn't matter if a house-elf wants to be free since in the end its up to the master.

Another important thing is to make sure that there is possible employment for freed elves, we heard from Dobby that in the two years he was searching he didn't find anyone who wants to pay a free house-elf for their service, despite only asking for very little payment and time off.

The only person we know willing to pay an elf for their work is Dumbledore, and ability to be employed shouldn't rely on a single powerful wizard being generous and good of heart.

For the elves themselves I think it would be important to make clear to them that freedom isn't something an elf should be ashamed for, before making clear that they are allowed wanting to be free.

***** I'd add education to the mix for the elves, as well. It's pretty clear that in canon they don't really get much of it - and particularly none with respects to them becoming free. Like even Dobby, the one elf we see who does want to be free, doesn't really know what to do after that.

The only way to undo centuries of slavery and the mindset that they've been taught from birth is, well, to un-learn it. Otherwise, no amount of other things happening will really have a large impact. Just to add to your last point there.

** The best explanation for it, IMO, is magical slavery. Essentially, way back in the past, someone created or altered house elves to tie their magic to wizards to enslave them - and by the canon timeline, it's been centuries of them being slaves, raised as slaves, treated as such, etc that results in their canon state.

It's one of the more abhorrent parts of the setting, and one of the more annoying conclusions that JKR tries to push on the reader - that is, that the situation of the house elves is generally acceptable and that Hermione was wrong to push for their increased freedom. It's possible she meant only the methods she used without asking - but that nuance, if intended, is lost with a lot of readers in the process.

The entire canon process of house elves needed to be fully abolished and help them transition out of that slavery entirely. However, a lot of fics don't want to concern themselves with such affairs - which is fair, since house elf liberation would have to grow into a somewhat major plot point. In that case, I think a retcon of house elves into a much better treated, symbiotic, and somewhat independent approach would work, just to let it be 'acceptable' enough that a good Harry shouldn't feel a need to tear the system down.

One thing that also pops up with house elves is essentially taking slavery/confederate apologist/defender's claims in the US at face value - and just applying it to house elves, and canon seems to push that along. For instance, the 'happy house elf slave' idea would fit right into the idealized version of happy black slaves singing in the field while picking cotton - presumably while their wise and benevolent masters would be off to direct matters in the perfect manner, now that their intellect is free to do less menial tasks. It's striking to me that something that Frederick Douglass /scathed/ in the first half of the 19th century is taken at face value and plastered onto happy, willing house elf slaves and dismissed.

At /least/ free house elves. Have them fill the loyal servant/butler role that's so prevalent in stories, but at least make them free past that :/

** Personally I like to come up with more unusual theories and headcanons, and the nature of houselves is no exception.

Since elves are Fey creatures, and the number one rule of dealing with the Fey is "Don't deal with the Fey if you can possibly avoid it" I like the idea of contact with them, and worse, allowing them to work for you being a Very Bad Thing. Thus I came up with the following setting:

House elves live by taking the sanity of the family they work for.

This is why so many old families have individuals that are completely deranged. The elves at Hogwarts take a small amount from everyone who attends/works there, which leads to the wizarding world as a whole lacking "an ounce of common sense." We can see this from the Trio's actions and motivations becoming more erratic the longer they attend Hogwarts. Indeed it is likely that Hermione as an adult would not be able to solve the logic puzzle that she did in moments during her first year.

When unable to leech of their masters sanity due to either being freed, simply not having their master close enough to leech from, or due to a conscious choice by the elf in question, the elves themselves rapidly descend to insanity, we see this with both Winky and Kreacher. Though Kreacher technically does have a master, because he does not acknowledge him, his condition does not improve.

Dobby of course is an exception to the rule. Whether because he cannot, or simply chooses not to, he has never drained any human's sanity. He has been insane his whole life, and as a result he has no problems from being freed. It is obvious why the other elves would shun him.

**** Well I came up with most of it on the spot just now, and it's a setting, not a headcanon, but for 1)No, the elves would've phrased it in such a way that that wasn't apparent, and for 2) the whole lack of common sense plays a part, as well as house elves being common enough among old families that there's no evidence connecting the two.

And assuming that they are Fey, albeit odd ones, they don't have the same morals and compunctions as humans. Things like ironing their hands doesn't make any difference if it doesn't actually hurt them for example.

The only elves we see that don't like the state of affairs are Dobby and Kreacher, neither of whom are getting anything out of it. Though I will admit there is a very small sample size to make definitive judgements.

***** Well, the idea is interesting for sure and it we were to assume it to be the case then perhaps, however I really got impression that they /are/ hurt when they're hurting themselves, the idea that they pretend so well does not convince me all that much.

Also I don't know how I feel about mixing classic faes with Harry Potter universe, but that's just my apprehension.

One way or another, I cannot in good conscience interpret them as really good liars. To me they seem like slaves. :P Even if they were faes, they don't give me this kind of vibe, they're not enough malevolent I guess. :P

Maybe if it was a focus of the story, well fleshed out and solved gradually enough. It would be like a plot twist or so.

But honestly, as it is now, I can't see them as nothing other than slaves. All the signs point to it. Like - there are some things that you could assume that doesn't disagree or clash with what was shown in canon, but this is one of those things that seems far too unbelievable. I don't see it as passing as canon or possible-canon.

Even as an AU I think there would have to be made a solid explanation for what we were shown in canon.

** I'm not giving an explanation for it, as we weren't given enough information. Hermione jumps right in and starts screeching about slavery and trying to free them. That is clearly not the thing you do...

For all we know, House Elves could be some ancient evil forced into this position, and freeing them could doom the world. Or freeing them could break a symbiotic link and cause them to die a slow and painful death. Hell, wrongfully freeing a happy elf could curse you proportionally. Maybe mistreating elves has a karmic effect to it? Everybody who has mistreated an elf has either died, had their world crash down around them, or had to live with Voldemort.

​

Seriously people, before you go "Well, that seems a little outrageous to me, you must be blowing shit out of proportion!" Well, I present to you [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/28_Days_Later][28 Days Later]], which is based off of this premise.

You are in a world of magic, with weird rules governing everything. Harry got attached to a contract without his consent with the Goblet of Fire. Don't forget prophecies.

​

And JKR coming out right now saying that isn't the case wouldn't disprove my argument. Because most of the people who would free an elf without knowing the whole story purely on the belief that "slavery bad" would meddle with something they know nothing about and get themselves killed later on. Or cause an apocalypse.

​

Now downvote me because I didn't agree with you.

This is completely false. Hermione spends days researching about house elves in the Hogwarts library between classes and meals, before acting on it and creating SPEW.

She's bullheaded, idealistic and not at all pragmatic about it and so she's largely ineffective during her time at Hogwarts but she at least has one good idea that they need to raise awareness about their mistreatment, /for a start/. It's not something one person can change.

About the rest of your points, you're dealing with suppositions. It can be true or not, we have no evidence to support it so I'm gonna have to rely on Hitchens' razor.

** It's probably something along the lines of a magical contract, the elf or line of elves serves a family in domestic manners in exchange for shelter in a magical area (like a magical home or Hogwarts) as magical creatures do thrive in a magic saturated environment. They shouldn't of course be abused as they do work for you and an unhealthy and unhappy elf is an unloyal elf (ie Dobby to the Malfoys). I see it like something akin to a hunting dog, you give the dog shelter, food, and purpose and in turn you reap the benefits, but at the same time an abused dog will be quick to bite and therefor should be respected.

***** What makes you say that dogs are sapient? They're certainly /sentient/, but sapient basically applies to 'intelligent' species - ie, humans are the only ones that we know of right now.

In harry potter, we know that there'd be a number of additional sapient species - at the least goblins, house-elves, centaurs, merpeople, from what we see, and depending on definitions, we can probably add vampires and werewolves to the list (not sure if they'd be considered different species). Giants may also be sapient, though I'm not an expert for that. The interesting edge case, however, is /snakes/ - because they seem to be quite smart when Harry talks to them. I've seen some fics say that that's due to parselmagic itself - that they gain sapience while talking to/obeying a parseltongue.

** I think that house-elves are born to be slaves, as horrible as it seems to be at first glance. This is how they are made, it's their essence. And Dobby is either an error or an early manifestation of the natural evolution of house-elves.

Now, I think that other house-elves might be like Dobby and thus, they should absolutely have the option to serve or not, and be treated with the same rights as humans when they choose to not serve.

And more importantly, when they choose to serve, they should be treated as much as equal to humans as possible, in the sense that even if you give them orders, you should give them respect, have compassion for them, as much freedom as they can handle, as much rest and break they accept to take, give them everything they need to be happy - whatever they desire. Since they likely to refuse getting paid, then it's on you to pay for whatever they want. Basically, like their your (unpaid) employee, but not your slaves.

** I like how linkffn(Blindness by AngelaStarCat) deals with it.

Yes, they have a symbiotic relationship with wizards. No, it does not make it any better than slavery by any definition cuz wizards get far more out of the deal and it is not an excuse for mistreating them, which happens to be rampant.

So Harry uses his personal fame and power and his seat on the Wizemgamot, along with Hermione's articles on the issue through their shared alter-ego, to enshrine house elf rights into law. The house elves get a contract with mandatory holidays, retirement benefits, salaries and an exit clause. Not to mention, protection from mistreatment like any normal employee. They can choose to be free if they want.

Even stories that want to treat the relationship between wizards and house elves as symbiotic actually end up depicting it as *parasitic* (which is how it is in canon). They say that elves serve in return for the wizard's magic but I've never seen it actually being depicted as such. There's no difference between wizards who have elves and those who don't, in these stories; the elf "owner" doesn't look like he's giving anything in return. And kindness isn't sufficient to be considered.

I get that the authors don't want to deal with the issue because it distracts from their plot. But I'll say that it would be better that they say nothing about it at all if house elves are not a big part of their plot. If they are, it would be good to see them actually /show/ a symbiotic relationship, or instead of hand waving the issue (if they don't want to get into elf rights in the plot), have their characters express their displeasure at the situation at the very least, if they don't have the means or the time to truly act on the issue because of whatever is going on in the story.

** I think I read a fic a while back that had a good interpretation of this. It is slavery, but Hermione's approach to trying to free them isn't really appropriate. Basically, they should be allowed to do what they want, and if that means their job in canon that's ok. The only problem is the fact that if they are an outlier who wants to do something else like Dobby they don't really have that choice. So the slavery isn't in the fact that they work for wizards without pay (since most of them like it), but that if one of them is in a situation they clearly don't like they have no choice. So providing them a way to get out of that situation/recognise it is the key.

** Canon route isn't slavery it's a two sided issue in canon as well. I'm Anti-SPEW like Hagrid, : Hermione is pro spew because she uses her muggle understanding and thinks that what the house elves want. Freedom, when in fact it isn't what they want.

IF you're goal is to help someone, you should ask them what they want help with rather than tell them what they need help with. Dobby is considered an outlier by other house elves.

"But they don't know any better." I think they know their own needs better than we do. It's weird to me that people try to use our standards to apply to something that isn't our standard. For example Neville being hung out of the window by his Uncle so his magic would show up. In our society that's pretty awful; however, is it awful in the wizard society? Because wizards can just magic up a cure for almost any physical harm, do they not care as much about physical injuries? Is it right for us to hold them to our standard, when they are not subject to the rules of our standards?

In the eloquent words of Hagrid though: " ‘It'd be doin' 'em an unkindness, Hermione,' he said gravely, threading a massive bone needle with thick yellow yarn. ‘It's in their nature ter look after humans, that's what they like, see? Yeh'd be makin' 'em unhappy ter take away their work, an' insultin' 'em if yeh tried ter pay 'em.' "\\
/Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire/

Just because Dobby was happy with freedom, we see that Winky clearly wasn't happy with freedom: " ‘Winky was sitting on the same stool as last time, but she had allowed herself to become so filthy that she was not immediately distinguishable from the smoke-blackened brick behind her. Her clothes were ragged and unwashed. She was clutching a bottle of Butterbeer and swaying slightly on her stool, staring into the fire.'"\\
/Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire/

This house-elf is literally developed a drinking problem because she was so depressed with freedom. Like all things in life it's a complex issue, some small minority of house-elves would like freedom and should probably have it, the vast majority of them wouldn't like it and probably shouldn't.

** To people who write "it's in their essence" - please present a quote from any reliable source that this is the case. It might be from an interview, a Pottermore article or the books.

That being said, please remember that even if Dumbledore, Ron, Sirius, Lucius and Draco said so doesn't make it true. Was such a statement based upon any documented proof? What I mean - so e.g. If Lucius said it's in the elves' very nature to be slaves - do we get a confirmation that his opinion was based on a /fact/ known within the universe? Or was it just magical community's assumption and they have no actual proof?

Same with articles / interviews - please mind how it's phrased - is it created as a meta knowledge for readers only or is it made to look like an excerpt from a paper / a book / a journal etc. that exists within the HP universe?

So - character's statement are not necessarily facts, only opinions unless a proof has been presented within books or different approved material. They don't have to lie, they can believe what they're saying is true and simple be mistaken. And with this particular issue it definitely needs to be taken under consideration.

Basically mind the difference in phrasing, as in "House elves are..." vs. "House elves are believed to be...".
