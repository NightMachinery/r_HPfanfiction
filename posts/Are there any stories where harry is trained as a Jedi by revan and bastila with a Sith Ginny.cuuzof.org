Harry is trained by Revan but I don't think Ginny has a big role. It's HHr

This one is really well written and Harry trains with Revan, but Ginny doesn't have a role at all.

  Answer to YugiohFreak54's Challenge: Losing Sirius hit Harry hard; so hard that he attempts to run away, but is stopped by a summons to his destiny: a summons from Gringotts and DARTH REVAN; now commanding the Force, can Harry get some answers? H/Hr

  Harry Potter is done with life. He did everything and all he wanted was to pass on to the next great adventure. Sadly, rules get in the way of this and he must now find a new way to keep living. It's not all bad though. At least he gets another chance to live life his way and on his terms. Warning: Mentions of attempted suicide and other stuff to come.
