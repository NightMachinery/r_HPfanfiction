Looking for a fic where Harry and Hermione have an one-night stand, Hermione gets pregnant and she flees to NYC so she doesn't get in Harry's way. I also remember when Harry finds out, he goes invisible to Central Park and watches Hermione and their daughter.

#+begin_quote
  Hermione left to find her parents and was never seen nor heard from again until years later when an old friend stumbled into her at a hotel in New York. They would both learn things about each other neither had expected and found a life neither had.
