Basically the title. Any fics where Snape is starting out as a teacher at Hogwarts. I haven't been able to find any that match so i'd really appreciate any help!


** There is a bit of it in linkao3(Hatching Robin by Teao), which is the prequel to linkao3(Becoming Harriet by Teao), but reading the latter is certainly not the prerequisite of reading the former. It is a WAY better explanation of Snape's true loyalties than the obsessive flimsy canonical excuse for the reason.

  A young Severus makes yet another mistake, and discovers that it's not only joining the Death Eaters that has far-reaching consequences.This is a prequel to 'Becoming Harriet', dealing with Robin's early life. It's going to be episodic and fluffy, and will probably be most interesting if you've read at least a bit of Harriet!
