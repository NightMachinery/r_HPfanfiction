** This ones not weird. It would actually have some decent background as long as you don't make this cracky or make myrtle too creepy.

maybe after CoS harry instead of ignoring one of tom's victims like he did in both movie and books.

He keeps coming back to talk.. Maybe in PoA She decides to help him by capturing the guy who is responsible for his parents death. So as a ghost she does not have to worry about Black. Only to actually find out about peter. since everyone is so used to ignoring her. So the whole remus/sirus/harry/ron/hermoine/ snape/peter confrontation never happens. Peter gets caught half way.

Next year During GoF when everyone turns away from harry he seeks her out. And they bond further over their respective injustices.

In Next year. OfP Umbridge tries to do something about harry but myrtle convinces peeves to help make her life hell. Peeves is not human so perhaps Umbridge insults him by calling him something along the lines of a Infestation...So He's like: And I took that personally. So Umbridge is claimed by the curse because she snaps and tries using a Killing curse in front of the wrong people...Cause lets face it. She was already willing to use one unforgivable. Just not in Public. In this she's too busy to really focus on harry. Perhaps Hrry gets moody because of near the end of the book Sirus is bitten by nagini and does not survive. He does kill Nagini in his last moements. Maybe a nasty curse he learnt but had too much morals to use on a person. Myrtle helps harry by making him realize that death is not the end of the person. And that in death There's no suffering anymore. Which would come in handy later on in the story (Hint Hint)Allowing Harry and mytle to become closer.

Next story I draw a blank ATM.

Deathly hallows happen normally except Ginny and harry never click in previous stories.

Myrtle help hide all of the students and adult muggle borns. Perhaps She can be a Parsletounge and riddle killed her because he wanted to stand out and be the only 'Special' one. He could have killed all others with that gift which could be why it's so rare.

(Further idea for another story...Maybe Horcurxs can't be created with just murder alone maybe the deaths must be important symbolically. Same with the objects. Maybe tom and Myrtle were Close or romanticlly involved. Thats maybe why Horcruxs are so foul. You have to kill someone important to you. thats why its so hard to create many of them...With each one created you lose the capacity to love another person. So in theory the reason riddle created 7 instead of 13 is because at 7 nothing except himself is important. Harry was important by default due to prophesy stating he 'Could' become Tom's equal) Thats why love heals horcuxes. Because you need to regret the harm you did to your loved ones in pursuit of power.

But back to point. She hides all the kids in the Chamber of secrets. Riddle can't get down there because of the changed password. Not 'Open' anymore. Maybe muggle borns hide at hogwarts from the ministry. If you don't go down that road..Perhaps myrtle found a room that was forgotten and lost because it's locked from the inside. Not RoR. Been over done. And other know by this point

Now back to final battle.. Harry vs Vodlemort. Neville steps up vs Bella and lestragnes. All comes full circle. Harry dies for good. No ressurcts but instead comes back as a ghost. He's mster of death!! turns out Master of death means you get the opportunity to be a Magic wielding ghost. But voldemort could never be Master of death because it can only be someone who does not want power. Thats why dumblore never could become it. Deep down he wanted it. But chose to avoid it because he knew he can't be trusted.

You can have dumbledore be like Paarthunax. Is it better to be born good. Or be born evil and choose to overcome it by casting temptations away through struggling against your very nature....

As for the master of death... COuld be like a force ghost from Starwars..Those stained with evil cannot obtain this ability and gain life after death.

So instead of moving on harry defeats Voldemort as a ghost vs wraith. By that point there is so little left of Voldemort that he's like a dementor now. just a cloud of evil. and harry is basically a living patronus. and touching Voldemort burns away the darkness. and because all the dementors in existence are there. they are being burned away as collateral freeing all the souls trapped in their stomachs as prisoners. but Voldemort is now nothing but a parasite attached to all marked death eaters. And he is draining all their magic in order to survive..rendering them permanent squibs and sterile one by one.

After there is no more death eaters with magic left he has nothing eft to sustane him. rendering him in oblivion. Not heaven or hell but worse. and infinite pool of blackness with nothing but himself for all eternity. Harry ends up like binns teaching Defense against the Dark Arts and lives happily with myrtle. Both stuck at 17. Being master of death means he can talk to his loved ones who are dead. Has to keep it secret because ghosts are literally incapable to tell the living about the after life. apperantly if you go to heavan you can come back as a spirit who can't be seen/touched/ or heard y the living. nor can you interact with them

​

Neville becomes headmaster (ends up being more beloved than Dumbledore)and earns his grandmothers respect and admiration for beating the lestranges.

Hermione becomes minister of magic. and brings Britain into a new age of democracy. disbanding the current government with inherited power. gives rights to all species.

Molly ends up with a huge family. Ginny becomes a quiditch player.

percy turned out to be working for Dumbledore. ends up making up with his family and becomes hermoines undersecretary.

ron becomes head auror.

Ron and Hermione end up together.. while Neville hooks up with ginny.

The death eaters are forced into the muggle world as punishment with charms and runes tattooed on them to keep Staute of Secrecy and to prevent them from dying prematurely. Runes don't make them keep a secret but rather make it so no one ever will believe them. they also make it so they will never be allowed to contact or come near a magic user again. Most death eaters will end up in alleyways as homeless people who are seen as crazy people talking about magic and dark lords. Relying on the pity of muggles(people they once saw as less them non-magical animals(Cows/Pigs/whatever)) to get by. a full circle as a ironic punishment for the rest of their lives.

And others like the students who were cowards and chose to get marked because they were afraid to do the right thing like draco and pansy end up coming to terms with the fact that they must live as muggles. Maybe they adopt an orphaned muggle born. Allowing that to all come fulll circle with them helping those they would once hurt.

​

And myrtle and harry have a wedding with all family their. living and dead,. myrtles and harry's parents and family there sorta like at the end of the shinning with danny's graduation with jack there as a ghost. only the dead notice them. everyone else can't see them. with the non-ghost dead going back to the afterlife.
