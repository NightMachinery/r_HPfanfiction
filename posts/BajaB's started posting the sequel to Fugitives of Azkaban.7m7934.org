** I wish he'd do a sequel to Dark Marauder. Dark Saviour or Son would be such a great title.

Or Harry Hufflepuff 4.

  Sequel to Fugitives of Azkaban. Incomplete and probably abandoned. Harry and Sirius have escaped Azkaban and against considerable odds survived, but Harry can't escape his fate. Warning, big parts of this are missing in the middle and it has yet to be complete, but I have not touched it in years so figured I might as well post it as is and maybe get inspired to finish it.
