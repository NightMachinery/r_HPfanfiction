Right now, I'm halfway through Hogwarts Battle School, and otherwise, I quite like it, but for all the spelling and grammatical errors. It puts me off a lot. So, what's your peeve?


** Instant romances when they're like 12 or 13 and are talking about true love and sex etc. Made worse when the female character at that age actively tries to or 'naturally' becomes either super-passive and helpless or worse, deliberately tries to be 'sexy' to get her guy. She is not a teenager, she is 12. She is not helpless, she /literally/ carries a weapon on her at all times. I get this worst about Hermione (a feminist know-it-all), Luna (a cloud cuckoolander) and Ginny (a very independent-minded person) because behaving in either of those ways, if not explained, is so out-of-character as well as being creepy and breaking immersion.

On the flipside, male characters of that age actively sexualising the girls. It might be realistic or true to life or whatever but it doesn't get the tone of Harry Potter and more often than not it comes off as sleazy and pervy.

*** I have to yet to read a fic that properly captures just how kids and teenagers act.

- Girls and boys think each other a bit weird, even if they are friends. Even best friends. They could know each other since birth and still only accept each other 99% of the time.

- Teenagers don't know shit about sex or love. They define each other on scales of cuteness, handsomeness, or hotness. All my best friends have been female and one confided they actually made a list in year 7.

- *Above all else, even the most smooth 13 year old you would ever meet is awkward.* Puberty means you can get aroused by the thought of math homework because your crush sits next to you in math class.

*** I get what you're saying on the last point, but uh, most 11-13 year old boys are pretty pervy. I mean, not so much in the stereotypical heavy breathing porn addict way, but close enough.

Glossing over it for the sake of style I can understand, but if you're intending to write a fairly realistic coming off age story, including it would seem pretty important.

Honestly, the way Harry Potter handled sexuality was always a sticking point for me. Either write it correctly, or don't at all. There has never been a boy in the history of man so desexed as canon Harry.

**** I think it's just handled badly. So often its not the looking and fantasising you'd expect at that age, its detailed sexual fantasies of an intensely pornographic kind. I dunno. I think it just comes off as smarmy, given it usually comes as very objectification-y and/or as an expression of /true love/. Can't sexual thoughts and ideas and musings be just that, without having to feature extremes of sex or 'purity'?

Harry or Ron taking an interest in boobs would be realistic enough - although I don't know if they're /those/ kind of boys entirely, given the 80s British setting. Those same characters, aged 12 or 13, discussing between themselves all the kinky things they want to do to or with Hermione or Ginny - much less realistic. No kid is that confident, and especially not kids with Ron or Harry's backgrounds.

** Well, of course bad spelling and grammar can ruin a story. That's a bit like saying salmonella can ruin a good chicken sandwich. But then, I'd argue, it wasn't a good sandwich in the first place.

What annoys me is when authors throw in too many tired old elements. Often I find stories which have within them the beginnings of something interesting but which then drown it out with tired old clichés like evil Dumbledore, evil Weasleys, evil Hermione, inheritances, ridiculous power bloat, and so the list goes one.

Personally I really hate it when an otherwise interesting Romance plot gets turned into a Gotta Catch Em All harem plot. I have seen so very many Harry/Multi stories that would be incalculably improved by simply choosing /one/ girl as the love interest rather than trying to spread the characterization out over three or four or more. There's never enough to go round and the story invariably ends up as yet another Harry/HotBlondeOne/HotSmartOne/HotSnarkyOne/HotFrenchOne mess.

*** The Harry/harem stories always strike me as lazy writing. I figure the author doesn't have a set in stone, this is exactly who Harry should end up with OTP, so they experiment with different pairings. What's lazy is that they aren't willing to create different story lines or plots for each pairing. They only came up with one story idea but don't know who they want the main love interest to be, so they just throw em all in there. It turns into such a mess.

It's just that some people can't take it when their favourite character has a name that's a straight-up diminutive instead of the one it got derived from. Which is silly because, in the end, it's still the same name---it's just for the official stuff that one is called and not the other---and nobody would begrudge a Harry who wanted to be called Henry just as nobody does it to Prince Henry who wants to be Prince Harry.

But then again, most people are too used to their own names to notice the above ... despite the fact that so many people already use nicknames pretty much interchangeably with names. Oh well.

** Super-traditionalist sexism in wizarding society. Yes, wizarding society is more traditionalist than Muggle society, but their traditions are /different/ than ours. In the nonmagical world, most sex discrimination can trace a common root to the fact that women are physically weaker than men. Considering that for most of human history your power was decided by your ability to commit violence to further your own goals(both on personal and national levels) that led to women being placed in a position of lesser power. However, sex does not affect one's proficiency at magic, so the history of sexual discrimination never developed in the magical world. A witch is every bit as deadly as a wizard, and in JKR's word for every male figure we have a female figure who is just as skilled. Merlin has Morgana. Godric and Salazar have Helga and Rowena. McGonagall is Deputy Headmistress, and is, if not /the/ most skilled magic-user in the country after Dumbledore and Voldemort, then is at least in the running for the position. Moody's personal apprentice was a woman. Bellatrix was Voldemort's right hand, even moreso than Lucius Malfoy. If not her husband's equal, then Lily Potter can be regarded as being /superior/ to James Potter, considering how widely her skills were praised. In the entirety of the series, there is not one gender-based discrimination shown, rather the discrimination we see is blood and occasionally wealth-based.

*** Actually, there's quite a bit of discrimination shown in the series - but it's more subtle than the blood-based discrimination.

Quick quiz: how many women in the series have both children and a career?

Answer: Zero! Amelia Bones comes closest because she's raising her niece. But she's also not married and doesn't have any children of her own. Otherwise, women /either/ have a career /or/ they have a family (husband, kids). Very traditionalist.

It's true that Bellatrix is a strong witch, but she's also a psychopathic terrorist. Evil characters usually show the traits that you are discouraging others from having. They aren't role models.

The female characters that get the most attention also tend towards nurturing, supportive roles - teacher, nurse, etc. Male characters, in contrast, tend to be the adventurers and risk-takers. This even includes Hermione to a depressing extent.

The gender discrimination isn't as overt as the blood discrimination, but it does get expressed in the sorts of social norms and gender roles that help perpetuate gender discrimination in real life. I wouldn't be surprised if Rowling didn't even realize it when she was writing it. Her books are better than average, but it would be a huge mistake to pretend that there aren't serious structural flaws anyway.

It's not simply about personal power. It's about social and political power as well. It's about what sorts of social, political, and gendered roles characters are depicted as having. A female character with lots of magical power doesn't make up for having mostly male characters being given the most leadership roles, being risk-takers, going on the most adventures, being the only ones with both a career and a family, etc.

**** That's a fair argument, but the point still stands that the magical world is far more equal to than the Muggle world-not perfect, but there is certainly none of the Victorian-chauvinism or condescension that you often see in fics. Amelia Bones, as you mentioned, headed the DMLE in 1995. As of 2015, neither the FBI nor the Metropolitan Police have ever had female directors.

So yes, there is still an imbalance, but there is certainly more equality to be found among the spell-slingers than the normal world.

***** Yet at the same time we've seen that the Head of house has rather a lot of power over his family members, as seen with the Black family. Also we see pretty much every married witch taking her Husband's last name. Although it wasn't like this yet in 1995 (it was a consequence of marriage equality coming to our laws in 2001), in my country when you marry either partner can use their own name, their partner's name, or a hyphenated combination of the two, and I often see people using this. Yet in the Harry Potter universe which is supposed to have more gender equality we don't see anything like that.

It seems more like a universe that was meant to be more equal, but the writer didn't notice a lot of things that aren't equal in our society, and left those in, a consequence of her own culture.

I also think that a lot of fanfics which magnify the gender inequality do this on purpose, and I don't /just/ mean regency-esque fics.

***** The fact that a woman can rise to the head of such an organization means that there isn't a lot of legal discrimination. The fact that the only women who can rise to such positions are the ones without families suggests very strongly that there is discrimination.

What's more, the presence of a woman at the head of an organization doesn't mean as much as you seem to think it does. Margaret Thatcher was Prime Minister, but that wasn't evidence that Great Britain was free from gender discrimination. Nor that it had even suddenly made great strides in that area, either.

It's not the accomplishments of selected individuals that we need to look at, but rather overall patterns - and looking at the former rather than the latter is a mistake that people make when trying to judge the strength of discrimination in the real world as well. Pointing to a single woman, a single Jew, a single black man, or anyone like that doesn't entitle us to say "Look, everything is so much better!", not when the overall patterns have remained the same.

There is also something even more important going on here. Bones' job doesn't send much of a positive message to female readers when her presence in the books is nearly non-existent. The consistent lack of female characters who have both families and careers does send a message - and it isn't a positive one.

Even Lucius, who doesn't have a job, a least has a "career" of sorts going out to bribe and influence politicians. He's moving in the political arena, doing and acting. That's something Narcissa should be capable of, but she doesn't.

Regarding female characters taking less risks overall, I think that's realistic, men do tend to be more reckless. That is however an average and you have outliers in both directions. And the book seems to have those too.

Other than that I mostly agree with your conclusions on the books, I have thought those things many times myself. Having at least one woman with a noticeable career /and/ children would have been nice.

Her existence at least proves that women aren't prevented from having both a career and a family in this world, but their relative absence "on screen" is significant.

2. It is of course an open question as to whether the differences you describe are more cultural or biological. There are indisputible biological factors, like levels of testosterone, but in a truly equal society perhaps that would only influence the outliers, an in the middle the numers would be roughly similar? There is simply too much weight of past discrimination and assumptions bearing down on current social behavior to simply assume that what we see happening is free from any bias or influence.

As to the second though, I'd say the middle would show a difference in risk taking behavior among certain others even just on testosterone. [[http://www.healthline.com/health/low-testosterone/testosterone-levels-by-age][According to this data]] I just googled the testosterone levels of men are an order of magnitude higher than those of women. There are clearly measured effects of testosterone on behavior and this will have an effect on behavior even in a truly equal society.

What I meant with outliers was that you will have women with high testosterone and men with low testosterone that go against that stereotype, as well as people who take more or less risk for other reasons (for example psychological, being depressed can make one reckless too).

******* Ah, but biology is not destiny. There can be no doubt that testosterone has an effect on behavior. At the same time, though, we can be equally certain that any given amount of testosterone doesn't automatically cause a person to engage in some behavior.

So there are other factors as well.

Now, the men who participate in a studies on the link between testosterone and behavior were raised in a culture that, to varying degrees, sent messages about boys being risk-takers and adventurers, about manliness being linked to aggression and suppressing emotions, etc.

So all we really know is that higher testosterone leads to more risk-taking behavior /in that context/. Maybe in a different context, men wouldn't be getting so many messages that induce them to act on something that a single hormone is subtly encouraging in the background. Maybe without those messages, the encouragement of testosterone wouldn't be as effective, leading at least to a lower difference between men and women. Maybe in a culture where girls are encouraged to be risk takers, much of that remaining difference would be eliminated from the other direction.

And there's something else, too. We /know/ that how a person is raised can have a significant influence on their later biology. An easy (and actually relevant for this subreddit) example is how abuse of a child can drastically alter their brain and brain chemistry for life. Is it possible that constant messages about risk taking, and then early acting on those messages by engaging in risk taking (or not, in the case of girls), could mold a child's biology to produce even just little more (or less) testosterone over the course of their life?

I could of course be wrong, but my larger point was also my first sentence in this message: biology is not destiny. We don't know nearly enough about how environment and biology interact to say with any certainty that in a different environment, we'd see the same sorts of differences in risk taking behavior between males and females. I'd be surprised if we didn't see any, but I also wouldn't be surprised if most of it were at the ends of the curves while in the middle the differences were a lot smaller - in part because boys aren't taught that they have to take risks to prove they're a man and in part because girls are taught that it's equally good for them to do such things as well.

But I think we do agree on what is actually the real issue here: books sending the message that boys are leaders, risk-takers, and adventurers while girls are carers, nurturers, readers, and homemakers are books that subtly perpetuate stereotypes and discrimination. Regardless of what differences might ultimately exist in an ideal society, we don't live in that society and should try to move beyond the messages such books communicate.

******** In the end, you are your biology + the sum of your experiences. I'm not saying biology alone dictates your actions, but it does play a part. And when we're talking statistics, because in the end stereotypes are generally based on extrapolated patterns, the results of that influence will show.

When you have biological differences between two demographics, such as men and women, some of those differences will influence behavior in a statistically significant manner, whether directly (hormones) or indirectly (since historically women couldn't exactly run from a pregnancy and as such would be stuck with the consequences to a larger extent than men, they are culturally expected to be more discriminating when it comes to selecting sexual partners. Effective contraception and abortion have in the last 60 years made that cultural expectation more of an unpleasant relic than the stimulation of a useful behavioral pattern that it was).

Where I do get messed up though is incontinuity. Like if they start by correctly saying "mum" but occasionally say "mom," that will completely throw me off.

From what I've gathered solely through reading author's notes, it usually just depends on if the writer has a beta for "brit-picking." If they don't have someone combing through, American writers will slip back into the more comfortable colloquial terms without noticing.

******* Since streets in the US (especially in cities) are laid out in a grid pattern, a block refers to the space between major cross streets. So if streets are laid out numerically east to west, then going from 1st Street to 2nd Street is one block, not counting the smaller streets, avenues, or alleys in the middle. Usually when people say "It's a few blocks over," they mean that you're not on the right street now, but you are within walking distance of where you need to be.

**** It's easy to find people who hate /some/ change from canon. Here it's "wandless magic." Other popular candidates seem to have been the animagus skill, the power of horcruxes, the power of parseltongue, and so forth.

In all of those cases, people have expanded on them and created something ridiculous. In some cases, creating something something good might be more of a challenge than most, but I see no reason to think that any of them would be inherently awful if expanded on, at least a bit.

Though I think that trying to do all at once would almost certainly become absurd. :)

Regardless, my point is... this is fanfic, right? Sticking slavishly to canon would just... reproduce canon, wouldn't it? The point is to change /something/. Usually a few somethings, too.

It's possible to go too far. If you remove any of the central defining elements of a universe, you shouldn't pretend that you're still writing fics for that universe (magic for HP, superpowers for Marvel/DC, etc.). But outside of such extremes, I have trouble understanding complaints about how changing something from canon is automatically wrong or a bad idea. It might be challenging, but it's also what defines writing a fanfic.

If someone objects to changes to canon so much, go read canon. The books are pretty good, after all.

******* Oh, well, I wouldn't argue that you can take any idea and make a hash of it. Absolutely. But wandless magic /does/ exist in canon, and in the hands of a skilled author, it can be used to enhance a character or an understanding of magical differences. After all, accidental magic in children is common, and I could certainly believe that concentrated studies or training could allow for a certain degree of wandlessness - perhaps never as varied or reliable as magic focused through a wand - but a short-distance /Accio/ doesn't seem beyond the bounds of credibility, or a signature spell - I could see Harry learning how to cast /Expelliarmus/ without a wand but rarely attempting it because the expenditure of energy required wouldn't be worth it except in emergencies. That doesn't seem too far-fetched to me or too damaging to suspension of disbelief.

And as Karinta suggests, a witch or wizard who's made a lifelong study of the practice and has great command of their magic could conceivably do a great deal without relying on a wand - but the difference is, they've dedicated their lives to learning how to direct their magic from the source. That just doesn't sound like a story-ruining concept to me, but YMMV.

Also using wrong terms/names, like using 'occlumency' when talking about legilimency, the 'crucio-curse' (should be cruciatus or torture curse), 'Zambini' and most annoying: wrong last names (not for AU reasons). Like when someone has Bellatrix married to Voldemort, and she becomes 'Bellatrix Riddle-Lestrange', no, she was born a Black, she wouldn't be a Lestrange (Also, do you really think that any witch marrying Voldemort would hyphenate her name? I'm not sure that's a safe decision with that man). I've seen this with other characters too but repeatedly with Bella.

Ow and religion. I'm okay with paganism (it's amusing) but any major real religion being a part of the story just makes me want to stop reading. Christianity in particular. I'm okay with Christmas (although I don't celebrate it myself) because it's mostly a commercial thing anyway, but no elaborate descriptions of Hermione going to the mass (or even getting permission to do that every Sunday, leaving Hogwarts for it).

First-person manages to make bad writing seem even worse, though. And newbie writers typically end up projecting their own fantasies and preferences onto the characters, which is even more cringeworthy than usual once you take away the little bit of distance third-person provides.

*** I have the reverse, when I start reading a fanfic written in third person, I'm already fearing the head hopping. When it's well-written both perspectives work fine in my opinion, but when it's bad, third person really breaks all immersion I have in a story.

Having one paragraph in which one character says something, and both her thoughts and the thoughts of the person she's talking to being shown to the reader just breaks my enjoyment of the story.

I think perspective should be fixed at least on a per-chapter basis. That means no switching between first and third person and no switching between who we are following constantly. Unless the main character is a legilimens and that is part of the story, don't let show me the thoughts of other people.

Also, most fictional books (as in, actually published works) I read are first person. It's just easier to get in a story and read it to the end without any fuss. A book being in third person doesn't mean I won't read it, but it has to be better for me to enjoy it. It's automatically at a disadvantage in terms of immersion.

***** I agree with HaltCPM. Dialogue is a tricky business, and if you don't have a natural gift for it, it can take several revisions to get it right. As a reader, I know it when I see it - I know when a writer has a talent for timing and turns of phrase - but I can't automatically call upon that knowledge when I'm facing the screen and struggling with characters having a conversation.

As someone who writes adequate but not outstanding dialogue, here's what I run into. Speech often works with beats and rhythms. You have to know how to make it flow, when to pause, how to vary the structure, how to switch off the rules of narrative grammar and echo the informality of speech without getting too slangy or out of character.

And I know this might seem an obvious point, but not all characters sound the same, and it can be surprisingly hard to stay true to tone and pitch and phrasing. Ron and Harry, for instance. It's not as if there's not a huge chasm of class and dialect dividing them, but it's there, and too often (IMO) writers deal with it by making Ron talk like an oaf or a clown. Or on the flip side, they give Harry dialogue that makes him seem dimmer than he is in canon, often unintentionally because they're trying to mimic some idea of what teenagers sound like, or they're overdoing Harry's relative innocence of adult matters (I don't mean sex, I mean all the things Harry was kept in the dark about, re: his destiny and the history behind it). Also, way too many of us forget how dryly sarcastic Harry can be (yeah, I've been guilty of this). He's snarky and scrappy, and he has a very sharp tongue when he's given a reason to use it.

Which reminds me - wit and humor are a big part of dialogue, and they're all over the HP series. I delight in wit, but I'm not a casually witty person myself. I can't always judge whether my attempts at humor hit the mark, or come up with a zippy line even when I know a scene cries out for it. I envy people who can produce pages of clever dialogue without breaking a sweat.

So that's a quick and incomplete rundown on some of the challenges of writing dialogue, for me at least. I'd be interested to hear how other writers feel about it.

****** I agree with what you're saying, but often I find that people write dialogue in the way a child plays with a dollhouse. Constant overuse of the other characters name, odd speech about what exactly they're doing, no contractions, plus all the standard poor grammar around speech. Like the other day I saw something similar to this:

"Ron I am going outside mate I cannot possibly stand your bickering any more so I need some fresh air" said Harry.

"What do you mean harry" asked Ron

"Sorry Ron but I am sick with you and hermione" screamed Harry.

I mean, people just don't talk like that. I understand people struggling with characterisation and even wit, but I struggle to understand how people end up writing dialogue in this way. We speak to people all the time, what turns our characters into robots like this?

I do on the whole agree with you. I am not a particularly funny person, so I can struggle with the wit and quick quips required of the characters. But I put that down to characterisation rather than the dialogue construction.

******* Oh, I see what you mean. Yeah, that's inexcusable. But usually when the punctuation and grammar are that bad, it's not confined to the dialogue, it's a problem throughout the entire fic. Dialogue conventions make the errors even more noticeable and the writing even more incoherent, but it's a symptom of poor language use overall, I think.

I'd venture to say that even the best fanfic uses names in dialogue far more often than pro fic or real life. If the writer is careful, I don't notice it, but it's a compromise. Names can be useful for emphasis or for keeping the various lines of dialogue on track, but the constant repetition is a red flag to me that the writer is barely paying attention to what they're writing, and either isn't correcting mistakes or doesn't understand that lack of punctuation /is/ a mistake, and that whacking names back and forth like the ball in a tennis match will drive their readers crazy.

Actually, I doubt I would have made it as far as that bit of dialogue you quoted. If that's a fair sample of the writer's style, I would have been catapulted out of the fic in the first paragraph.

***** perverse-idyll covered most of it.

The thing with dialogue is that its a fine balancing act between trying to replicate actual people talking...and yet, not really. There are things we say (unconsciously) in real life that doesn't translate well into a story (the most obvious example being "filler sounds" like um, er, uh, (excessive uses of) yeah, well, of course, really etc.).

To craft dialogue is an art, and it takes plenty of thought to pick the right word.

The second obstacle is that dialogue has two parts two it. One is the question of "How does what x character says relate to the overall plot?" The other is "What does what x character say reveal about him/her to the reader?" Often, a writer focuses on one to the detriment of the other.

Then there's the fact that not all characters sound the same, in terms of nuance (catch phrase, pauses), intelligence (word choice), background and a variety of other factors to consider for one character. Imagine doing that for a cast of say six characters. The sudden "gear-shifting" you do in your head to get into the mind of each of the characters is some incredible mental acrobatics, and I personally find it disconcerting.

Then, of course, there is your personal limitations. In order to write humor, you need to have a sense of it. In order to write a smart character you have to have a modicum of it.

Combining all of these things makes for the most difficult aspect of writing. Good dialogue, after all, should tell your reader everything they need to know about the character.

** I've noticed that certain phrases stick out to me and I like or dislike them based on the story. I can't stand the phrase "shush you" because an author used it a million times in their fic and all their characters used it. There is nothing wrong with that phrase but the way the author used it ruined it for me. Due to another fic I think the phrase "sweet baby mauve" is the funniest damn thing I've ever read and I enjoy seeing it used in other fics.

The emphasis was placed on that Umbridge was really a man and she was referred to as 'he' after that. I also recall one of Robst's stories having the ultimate punishment for Ron by turning him into a transsexual girl at some point.

I don't see how authors can justify it to themselves to make the main antagonist, and only the main antagonist, part of a minority that's already often discriminated against, and then also make fun of that character for being part of that minority.
