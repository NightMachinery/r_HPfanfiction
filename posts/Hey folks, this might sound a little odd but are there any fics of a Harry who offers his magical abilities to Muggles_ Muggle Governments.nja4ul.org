No slash, don't mind length/completion as long as it's well-written or captures the imagination.

Also, are there any very pro-UK fics?

Thanks in advance everyone and have a good day.


** Linkffn(With Strength of Steel Wings) Has a lot of wizard-muggle interaction on Harry's part. One of the major antagonists is actually a muggle in this one.

#+begin_quote
  A young Harry Potter, abandoned on the streets, is taken in by a man with a mysterious motive. When his new muggle tattoo suddenly animates, he is soon learning forbidden magic and planning to infiltrate the wizarding world on behalf of the "ordinary" people. But nothing is ever that black and white. (Runes, Blood Magic, Parseltongue, Slytherin!Harry) (SEE NOTE 1st Chapter)
