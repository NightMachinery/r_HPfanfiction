It is pedophile garbage

Edit: some instances of pedophillia at least from tvtropes.

Blue and Orange Morality: Narcissa has no problem admitting she's a pedophile but she was distraught to learn her favorite child prostitute was both magical and family. She insists that no children were harmed at a child brothel, because none of them were magical.

Expecting Someone Taller: A woman who ran a child brothel and whom all the workers looked up to and called "Mama"? The former prostitutes' new foster parents assume she's a grown woman who's either a pedophile herself or a sociopath who has no trouble pimping children. One who meets Jen is quite surprised to learn she's only seventeen and was actually a former child prostitute herself

Department of Child Disservices: Between some things that the Dursleys said and the bad experiences some of her employees at Candyland had with their foster homes, Jen honestly believes this, and so she sees running a child brothel as protecting her employees from the system.

Intergenerational Friendship: Jen and Narcissa are so close that Jen can functionally read Narcissa's mind through their use of Occlumency and Legilemency. Narcissa will probe Jen lightly then move the information she wants to share to the front of her thoughts. Though this is largely because ￼Jen was Narcissa's favorite prostitute before Jen grew too old for her.


** It's the unreliable narrator trope. You, the reader, are /supposed/ to think that everything is incredibly fucked up. This is the same fic where the MC murders a mother to steal all the protection she would have provided the child over the course of her life - dooming the child to a lifetime of being a magnet for misfortune.

The series is up to its eyes in horrible characterization - Sirius, in particular, is way OOC - and the MC, Jen, is very much the worst sort of villain. People are way too willing to accept her actions, even though she hides the worst of them. I eventually dropped it halfway through the first year, since there's bashing and awful, tropey plot devices aplenty.

But Lolita and The Cask of Amontillado are both legit stories, if objectively disturbing and horrible. There's no reason not to rec it if that's what the Request is asking for. Just include an aside that it's got fucked-up themes and is basically a horror story.

edit: I should note that I don't actually recommend it.

** Looking at your new examples, who the fuck is recommending this fic? This is like /For Love of Magic/ bad.

If you absolutely had to guess whether the author was a horny teen or a pedophile, is there /anything/ to suggest that the author's younger than 14 and therefore has an underdeveloped sense of right and wrong? Proper grammar and good worldbuilding in a fic that has pedophilic undertones just makes things significantly worse because it suggests a level of maturity.

*** I find it believable that the author deliberately and genuinely wanted to go as dark as it gets, fully knowing that they were entering a world of evil but taking it as a challenge. If one finds the depths of human evil interesting (as I occasionally do), the Black Queen series has some appeal.

Yes, pedophilia is abhorrent - especially the literal pre-teen pedophilia that is shown in this story. But that's kind of the point here to set up Jen as a protagonist who is completely fucked up (beyond repair, as it turns out over the course of the series). Keep in mind, the pedophilia "only" sets the scene and despite all her flaws Jen does go back to put an end to the brothel later. If you believe the author condones pedophilia, I don't think you're reading the story right. Besides, while it's clearly important for the characters' background, it doesn't actually fill a significant fraction of the overall story (which spans several books).

I do have various problems with the story, but they lie elsewhere. The biggest one is the characterization of "light" characters like Dumbledore and the Potters, which portrays them as rather foolish far too often. I'm okay with the evil committed early on by Dumbledore and the Potters to set the story in motion - Dumbledore is often enough seen as manipulative for what he perceives to be the "greater good" - but later on in the story their behaviours often don't make that much sense and feel pretty OOC. Some of it could be chalked up to an unreliable narrator, but overall I think it's more because the author was too lazy or unable to /really/ deal with the consequences of their chosen story and themes. Which is really unfortunate.

I'm also irrationally annoyed by any talk of magical cores, and this story has plenty of that. Still, for the most part this is one of the best takes I've read on a genuinely fucked up and evil OC protagonist in the Harry Potter universe, which can make you hate the character while still appreciating their humanity.

Overall, I'd say that reading the Black Queen series is a way of challenging yourself as a reader, and that's a legitimate reason for recommending it in my view. Literature is sometimes about making yourself uncomfortable. However, the recommendation /must/ come with plenty of caveats as one can tell from this thread. That's perfectly fine. (And if you think everything's just fine with the story and Jen is just a standup gal, then you have some /serious/ problems.)

** I guess my main question is how the story handles those topics. If it takes them seriously and presents them as negative, simply writing about a fucked up world, I think it's fine. If it's trying to justify the actions of pedophiles, then that's pretty fucked up.

Same goes for underaged sex in fics. If it's presented as a coming of age story, that includes sex between characters, I think that's fine. Some teens have sex with each other, that's reality. But, if it's just underaged smut, that's a lot more questionable.

Personally, I'm against the censorship of art (not saying that's what this post is doing, if the fics breaks the subs rules and shouldn't be recommended that's fine, I'm more talking about further action like taking the fic off the site/s it's hosted on), however that doesn't mean some pieces can't go too far and that people should be accepting of them just because they're art.

*** As someone who only read so far before stopping. The story seems to handle the topic as if it were in favor of it. At least to an extent with the main fem harry and Narcissa being on very friendly terms with each other because Femharry was Narcissas favorite girl when she was younger. The only time Narcissa (who mind you IS a protagonist or at least a supporting character) feels upset about the femharry being a child prostitute its because she was magical not because she was a child.

The Femharry runs the child brothel over the summer because having sex with people for money is better than being abused and is fun, because children can consent obviously

*** I'd say it takes the topics kind of seriously. The MC is seriously fucked up, is very morally bankrupt, but they are still the MC and are thus glorified in some ways. I do think the examples in the thread are a bit disingenuous, because nothing explicit is shown or described, and the brothel portions are a pretty minor portion of the story.

Though I suppose for some people, what is mentioned is far past the line of acceptable writing. it's definitely super distasteful and fucked up, but for me at least I was able to gloss over those portions and just focus on the plot and magic systems, which I rather enjoyed.

I'd say it's worse than For Love Of Magic in terms of following the rules, so if it were banned I wouldn't lose any sleep. I just wish more stories were written with this level of world building and themes without being totally fucked up

She's a sociopath, has fucked up morals and is liberal with dark magic, yet the fic avoids the pitfalls of Princess of the Blacks.

*** Its not in favor of pedophilia, if that's what you mean. The first few chapters were bungled, I'll give that, but as someone who has read the story several times, I find it really good. The "Candyland" arc is settled after years of character development as Jen comes to terms with her distrust of authority. Since it's not a really huge part of the overall story, I dont feel too bad about spoiling it. She kills off the owner of the sex club and takes the kids to the police and keepanin contact to make sure they go to good families. This is after the Dursleys built up a fear of the CPS to keep her in line, to the point that she legitimately believed the club was a safe haven for kids like her.

It also has the MC raped, but instead of "Oh hi Narcissa, nice to see you", it is the reason why she made a pact with "the devil" (technically one of many divine entities) and is an all-out psychopath.

This and /To Reach Without/, by one of the same authors, are honestly the fics I think of when I say that the worldbuilding is amazing, the grammar impeccable, and the characterization pretty good, which makes the frank and nearing-explicit discussions of teenagers having sex all the more uncomfortable. /To Reach Without/ is mostly what I'm thinking of, as there really didn't need to be an explicit scene between Fem!Harry and Susan Bones. In /All According to Plan/, I just find the handling of trauma and sexuality off-putting for some reason.

And because the authors state that they're cohabiting meaning that they're probably adults, they don't have the excuse of being horny teenage boys for the more taboo statements.

The wizarding world here is drastically different, and the author has to spend thousand of words with fem!Harry listening to lore explanations, and just how wrong she was about /everything/. For example, in this fic Voldemort is actually fighting for muggleborn rights in a super convoluted way?? You call that good worldbuilding, I call that a failed premise that should have just been an entirely different story from the beginning.

**** There's no actual sexual content involving minors. They mention that she was coerced into becoming a child prostitute, insinuate things happened, but there is no explicit content involving kids. I think the worst of it is when she tries to explain being raped by a drug addict when she was first left on the streets by the dursleys, but even then she simplifies it to a little girl and a group of angry trolls. I get what you're saying, but even with Narcissa, the most that's mentioned is she used to dress up as a serving girl and wait on her during her "visits". I think the author was very careful about not blatantly talking about what was happening. Then again, I am a biased reader, so maybe I'm forgetting a passage where they do mention explicit actions.

***** [[https://old.reddit.com/rules/][Here are the full rules:]]

#+begin_quote
  Reddit prohibits any sexual or suggestive content involving minors or someone who appears to be a minor.

  This includes child sexual abuse imagery, child pornography, and any other content, *including fantasy content (e.g. stories,* “loli”/anime cartoons), that *depicts,* encourages, or promotes pedophilia, *child sexual exploitation,* or otherwise sexualizes minors or someone who appears to be a minor. Depending on the context, this can in some cases include depictions of minors that are fully clothed and not engaged in overtly sexual acts.

  If you are unsure about a piece of content involving a minor or someone who appears to be a minor, do not post it.
#+end_quote

The fic breaks the letter of the rules, regardless of how "tastefully" it avoids scenes of explicit sexual contact between minors or adults and minors. This doesn't mean you can't read and enjoy it if you want to, it means you can't post links to it in this or any other subreddit.

******* Fine: you love the fic. If, for some reason, it does not bother you seeing pedophilia being sold as a " sexual option" ( hint: it is not. It is a heinous crime) then I can accept that. But understand that, by recing this fic, you are helping make it popular and thus, spreading pedophilia propaganda. Because it is just that. and it really bothers me that the author patches himself/ herself on the back by stating " hey, I am not going to do anything graphic, because you know, it is not nice" Seriously? WTF!

I went there through one recommendation on this reddit and I was so fucking triggered by it. So yes, while you feel the urge to defend your favorite fic, make sure not to rec it anymore because pedophilia is not something to be overlooked- */ever./*

******** You realize that there is no actual pedophilia in the story, right? One character is and people are grossed out by it. There is no positive light to it at all. The story is literally about how being abused fucked up her entire life. I'm assuming you were triggered in the first few chapters, but if you'd gone beyond that you would have found a story where a girl tries to move past what was done to her and embrace her power. She helps the kids who were abused alongside her and finds them families who will support them. This is not in any way pedophile propaganda. Sorry you were triggered, but not everyone is triggered by the same things. I'm not going to get in to my personal experiences, but I agree. Pedophilia = bad shit.

The fact that the author does not Go into Full detail is not a plus.

The author goes out of his way to "show" Narcissa being a pedo is a sexual option. Andrômeda shames Sirius and Tonks for findingbit disgusting. We are treated to Narcissa lamenting being caught with a 11 year old boy...

The story is def not what you are trying to sell.

**** Not for me. I can honestly see Narcissa threatening to make public Black family dirty laundry (she specifically mentions that Sirius impregnated dogs in his animagus form). She loves her family, but for all anyone knows, liking younger partners was a school thing (fifth-year being caught with a first year, etc). She isn't the type to just let the truth get out, because even though she tries to justify it ("they're just muggles"), she knows that it's NOT going to be accepted. Her family knows this and just lets it lie, assuming she doesn't continue. They anonymously try to close down the brothel behind the scenes, and Jen is the only one who knows Narcissa continues to go. To me, it fits right into what I know of the two dark Black sisters. They're all about family until it's family vs. their own well being. Does that make sense? Ugh. I don't know if I'm explaining my thoughts on this well.

Blue and Orange Morality: Narcissa has no problem admitting she's a pedophile but she was distraught to learn her favorite child prostitute was both magical and family. She insists that no children were harmed at a child brothel, because none of them were magical.

  Anti's are basically a symptom of purity culture they try to drive out artistic expression and fics out because it doesn't meet their standereds of purity. For example I had a friend who got bullied off multiple discord channels and accused of pedophilia by an anti. The thing is one aliens two both far over the age of consent apparently however age gaps are now one of the worse things in the world apparently. I've taken a strong stand against antis ever since.

********** Not trying to ruin your argument, I'm definitely firmly anti-pedophilia, but to get facts correct, only 13 states in America have an age of consent set at 18, while the majority (30) are set at 16. The media, mostly being produced in California, skews perceptions though because California is one of the states where the age of consent is set at 18. Additionally, military law is also set at 16, with exceptions for people who are married to minors 12--15 years old.
