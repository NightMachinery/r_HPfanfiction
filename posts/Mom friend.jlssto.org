I was wondering if anyone knew of any good fics that feature mom friends. Not in a smothering way though.

*** Tbh if Ron were a little more mature and didn't have the emotional range of a teaspoon, I could definitely see it.

**** Yes! There is a fic where he teaches the boys in the dorm how to shave because he is the only one with a dad or older brothers, and I feel like we need more of that

  The last real thing Harry remembers is standing across from Voldemort and watching the killing curse fly at his face.Then he visited a fluffy white limbo that somewhat resembles King Cross Station and instead of choosing to move on or go back he does something else entirely.And wakes up in his cupboard on the morning of Dudley's eleventh birthday.Because that makes sense.(No. No it doesn't.)But Harry is going to roll with it anyway.
