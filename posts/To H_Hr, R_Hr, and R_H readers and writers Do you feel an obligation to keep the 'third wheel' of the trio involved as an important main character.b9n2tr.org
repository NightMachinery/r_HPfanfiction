This is preferably for non-AU stories, at least to the point where their friendship is already established.

*Follow-up Question:* If the answer is no, how much distance do you put between them and the pairing (Friends but not as close, acquaintances, or full-on antagonists)?


** If they're an established trio of good friends and two of them suddenly jump into a relationship, I expect a couple of things.

- Ideally, they stay friends. Exactly how that plays out obviously depends on your story, but hopefully the 'third wheel' grows to accept the new relationship and be happy for his friends.
- The third friend cannot suddenly become an emo Nazi. If there's going to be fallout and drama and the trio is going to break apart, then there needs to be some sort of understanding for the poor unlucky sod who just lost his two best friends. The third wheel character can be hurt and lash out and all that jazz, but it needs to be believable. Harry, Hermione, and Ron are all basically good people, with both strengths and weaknesses in their characters; if I see them turning comically evil and/or being bashed a la [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RonTheDeathEater]["Ron the Death Eater"]], I'm out.
- Hopefully, the 'third wheel' will find some new friends to fill out the hole in their social life. Maybe Ron makes friends with Dean and Seamus, or Harry starts to spend time with Neville, or some such.

Unfortunately, if you're looking for an easy answer, I can't give you one. It really does depend on your story. I guess I personally prefer it when they stay good friends, or at least don't become bitter rivals? But I've read and enjoyed fics that did all sorts of things, so it's hardly a blanket recommendation.

(If it matters, I'll read just about any pairing, really, with only a slight preference for H/Hr.)

** It honestly depends on ship. Since you said non-AU, I'll assume canon characterisation.

1) For R/Hr, Harry would have no problems staying close friends with them. Though he might start giving space for the two and probably he might feel slightly jealous that his best mate Ron is no longer spending time with him. Canonically, Harry doesn't have any feelings for Hermione, so no love triangle drama occurs.

But if your Harry also has feelings for Hermione, then it would be a different story.

Harry usually tends to keep everything to himself. So he would slowly drift away from them to avoid heart break. Maybe he would stop thinking about girls or romance once he learns that he is a Horcrux.

2) For H/Hr, ah, now it depends on two cases. When it is before fourth year or when it is above fourth year.

Before fourth year, though there are budding feelings between Ron and Hermione, Ron hasn't realised that he likes Hermione yet. So he will not feel that much jealous when Harry and Hermione date. Infact he would even joke about, /"Why settle with Hermione Harry, when you have Cho?"/ Or /"I don't envy you mate. Hermione is mental."/ something like that. Then slowly he would reaslise that he likes Hermione, but she is already dating her best mate! Then depending of how you choose the events further, Ron would drift away from them or Ron would move on with another girl etc.

After fourth year, the story would be different. The tensions would be high among all three of them. Depending on how you write, the entire trio might break up. Then Harry comforts Hermione and they become closer. It's going to be heavily invested in emotions.

3) R/H, kek, now that would be really fun to write.

** As someone who mainly only reads h/hr. Anything past HBP is weird for me. The author always feels the need to break canon pairing gs in some and give the whole ' I've loved him the whole time, but I never thought he'd see me more than a friend.' No, the best stories start earlier imo. Also dumping Luna or another character as Ron's love intrest to do so.e justice for his character is very forced and a disservice to both characters.

*** There is indeed a point where it feels pretty contrived to just throw them together. I also can very well imagine Ron going to find someone just to spite the pair.

That's pretty much what he did with Lavender to make Hermione jealous with poor results. Or maybe just to make him feel like he achieved something? Either way, it would be totally in Ron's character to find a partner and them to leave them. If he really did find a love interest, then that would probably seem cheap though. People have an odd habit of just thinking a relationship is the default position.

**** Slightly off topic, but I don't know if I agree that Ron went out with Lavender to make Hermione jealous. I always got the impression (and it could be a wrong one, since I barely pay attention to canon after fifth year and basically only read the later books once) that it was more along the lines of him being elated that someone (who happened to also be very pretty) was interested in him.

***** Its probably a bit of both, but if Ginny hadn't teased ron about his lack of exploits, wouldn't he and Hermione have continued their relationship? Gone to slughorns party? Started dating? When confronted about it he says,

"she has nothing to be angry about, because of her and krum." (Not an exact quote obviously, but along those lines.)

***** I kinda saw it as both in a way. To spite Hermione and to show to himself that he could. I could myself be mistaken in the former as it has been a year or two since I've read the books. Fanfiction also tends to gloss over Lavender or outright ignoring her altogether.

****** Ron "went along" with this relationship more than anything else. He was pretty disturbed by the idea that Hermione pay have kissed Krum, and had accepted to go with her to Slughorn party. But what happened was that, in a moment of glory after a Quidditch victory, Lavender snogged him and he didn't stop it.

No matter how the relationship started, Ron became disturbed by it pretty quickly (at Chritmas already) but didn't know how to deal with it. They broke up after Ron poisoning when Ron unknowingly called for Hermione presnece rather than his girlfriend.

Bad move from move to go out with a girl just because he could without really liking her, but hey he is 16, that's the age you are stupid about it. I see a boy who don't know how to deal with his feelings and do stupid things about it, but Hermione is kinda the same, with her attack on him and her escort to the party specificaly chose to make Ron jealous the most.

** I think that's actually one of advantages of the canon: it seems to me quite realistic, that the long-term (life-long) relationships are only establishing in the late teens, and especially with the pressure of war etc. it is quite possible that Harry would be a bit late (he really doesn't have enough time to date; I quite agree with DH that on the run his dating opportunities on the ground were quite limited). So, the canon solution is quite good IMHO (horribly written Ginny notwithstanding), and it is quite possible that The Trio would later convert into The Quartet. Again, this is one of the strong parts of the fics by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Northumbrian/pseuds/Northumbrian][Northumbrian]].

Certainly one thing I dislike about soul-bond stories is that they are usually crazily early: I mean, linkffn(5435295), Ginny having a baby at fifteen? Poor girl!

*** Man I really hate soul bond fics that have arbitrary constraints the soul bond forces on them for the sole purpose of manufacturing drama. Like, they are teenagers. They are going through enough drama with hormones and shit, not even counting Tom and the Magic Nazis messing with them. They don't need manufactured drama.

** In the fanfiction I'm working on, I wanted Ron to remain relevant but I didn't want him in a lot of the scenes. The story in my head was a 'us against the world' kind of story, so it wasn't that he was a bad person, he just had flaws and they all required to do different things that didn't need to be done together.

​

I think Ron has a lot of flaws that he has to work through because of his self-esteem issues. I chose to work through some of those flaws to a natural ending point and I think I did well with it. But it was a little bit of both in the end. He was a big part of the story, but not in a direct way that caused drama to a new relationship.

** I'm writing a several-years-post-war fic with H/He as the main pairing. To set this up, I've had Harry and Ginny drift apart because of work and split amicably; she's always gone at quidditch practice and he's always busy with auror training, and they realize that while they can still be friends, they've grown out of love.

Ron and Hermione is less amicable, she's training to be a healer while simultaneously taking a muggle post-grad program for medical training, and lobbying for house elf and magical creature rights; and he has issues with the muggle medical practice of cutting into people, and with the house elf rights movement. She isn't faultless, I just can't remember what fault I gave her. They split badly.

Eventually the trio reforms, and farther down the line everyone is on good terms once they come to their own personal peace with what happened.

** Honestly, I detest Ron, canon, fanon, stage, and screen. That said, I won't go out of my way to dump on him. I would just have him toddle off to Dean and Seamus. Neville and/or Luna have a more compelling depth that sadly JK didn't provide to the least of the Weasleys. Even Ginny, who you can replace with a house plant in most of her scenes is a stronger character. Ron serves as an anchor to keep Harry "relatable" and an "average boy" despite Harry being the ultimately martyr-hero.

If I were to keep the trio intact, I would probably have him make the sacrifice play foreshadowed in PS taking the shot so Harry can finish off the Bad.

** No, I don't find Ron very interesting or relatable and therefore I don't feel like writing him into many scenes. I'm simply not invested into the character.

Which does not mean that he should get bashed or anything. But, and this might be my personal experiences shining through, friendships rarely end with big fights. Mostly they just fizzle out. You start to hang out with different people, you spent more time with the girlfriend and see each other less and less. Which is how I imagine the trio drifting apart if two of them start dating each other. The couple would want their privacy and the third one wouldn't want to be the third wheel. They spend less time together, they consequently meet other people and simply stop being best friends because they don't do as much together as they used to.
