** Not exactly fitting your criteria, but my ongoing story, is about what would have happened if Sirius hadn't fallen into the veil. It was an accident after all, so my story kind of continues from the Battle in DOM, but with the exception of Sirius not dying. So many stories take a different path with a very independent!Sirius but mine sticks very close to canon!Sirius who actively fights in the Order after being cleared. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12866177/1/Dysfunctional]])

  Post OotP - Sirius is cleared and finally gets to give Harry the home he had always wanted. But, the war is escalating outside and the Order of the Phoenix needs to rise to the challenge of defeating Voldemort and his Death Eaters once and for all. They just might have to make bigger sacrifices than they had imagined. No slash/bashings. Canon pairings. Semi canon-compliant.
