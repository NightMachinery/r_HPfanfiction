Is there a good, finished, marauders fic out there that encompasses all 7 years? I haven't been able to find one and I'm craving some good Marauders stuff. Preferably Wolfstar, but I can do without :)


** All the Young Dudes by MsKingBean89. I love it so much that I can't even read other marauders fics.

** Casting Moonshadows has superb character development, specifically around Remus Lupin. It's a popular Wolfstar fanfic that technically covers all 7 years (I believe the last year is skimmed a bit), but the first 6 years should satisfy your craving.

  Lonely and outcast by his classmates, Remus wishes on a moonshadow for a friend who understands him. To his amazement his wish is answered not once, but three times, by his former enemies, the Marauders. SBRL and some JPLE as well, of course.
