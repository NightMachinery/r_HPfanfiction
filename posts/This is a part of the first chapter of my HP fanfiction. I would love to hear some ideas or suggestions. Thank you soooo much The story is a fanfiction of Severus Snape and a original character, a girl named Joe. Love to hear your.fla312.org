King's Cross Station.

On the platform of nine and three quarters, people were loud and noisy. Classmates who hadn't seen each other during the summer vacation greeted excitedly. The parents who repeatedly reminded the troublemakers not to act rashly at school. Owls and cats kept barking. The students were running around endlessly on the train which constantly pump out red steam. 

Joe Mead, a sophomore in Gryffindor, pushed the luggage cart and carefully avoided the rampaging first-grade kids as he walked towards the train. But his way was blocked. Joe helplessly stopped. 

In front of him, two boys in school uniforms pretended to describe the horrible scene of fighting trolls with their first-year younger brother. The poor, frightened boy cried out loudly and screamed, "I don't want to go! I don't want to go to Hogwarts!" Even though his parents tried to hold him back, he was still struggling. 

On the left, there was another a family. A pair of parents were observing everything on the platform with interest, especially the beautiful steam train. Far away from them was a pair of sisters, they were quarreling. The little one seemed to be praying for something from her sister, but her sister was very angry and shouted, "I don't want to go!" "What kind of stupid castle do you think I want to go to?” And sister forcefully pulled her hand out when she shouted. 

On the right, there was a skinny woman with a suffering face leading a slightly hunchbacked black-haired boy. Their hooked noses looked very similar. They should be mother and son. Strangely, they had no intention of talking or getting in the train. The black-haired boy was staring at the quarreling sisters on the left. 

"Excuse me, can you excuse me?" Joe said politely to the mother and son. The boy didn't move, but the woman turned her head and glanced at Joe gloomily and silently, making way for him. 

"Thank you." Joe smiled at her and pushed her luggage over. After finding an empty carriage, Joe threw her luggage into the rack and sat down by the window. 

Flipping through a magazine and a pen from his schoolbag, Joe decided to pass the time by doing mental questions. Then, a red-haired girl pulled open the carriage door. "Excuse me ... is there anyone here?" She sniffled and asked. 

Joe glanced at her and found that she was the younger sister of the sisters who had quarreled on the platform just now. At this moment, her eyes were red and she had obviously just cried. Joe shook his head and continued to bury his head in the magazine. 

The little girl sat down opposite Joe and remained silent for a moment. May be she remembered something, tears flowed down her cheeks again. She hurriedly wiped them off with her hand and put her face against the glass window. The carriage was very quiet, only the sound of the little girl sobbing and the sound of feathers stroking across the paper could be faintly heard. 

But not long after, two noisy boys walked in, and they talked like they were talking about a Quidditch game. One wore glasses and had messy hair, as if he had just gotten off a broom. He was talking endlessly, while the other sat lazily tilted with his arms crossed. The two little boys were both very good-looking, and their faces were filled with pride that only those of good family background had. Joe did the eighth question. It was a little difficult. She thought for a moment and tried to fill in a number of 7. 

The door was opened again. This carriage was really lively. It was the black-haired boy on the platform. He had already changed into Hogwarts' school uniform. Judging from his appearance, he should be chasing after the red-haired girl.

He wanted to sit opposite the red-haired girl, but he found that Joe had already occupied that seat, so he could only take a back seat and sit next to Joe. "I don't want to talk to you." The girl's voice was tense. 

"Why?" "Penny, she hates me, she hates me, because we read her letter to Dumbledore." "So what?" The little boy said nonchalantly. 

Looks like he really doesn't understand the world. 

As expected, the little girl looked at him with extreme disgust. "She's my sister!" "She's just ..." The little boy quickly shut his mouth, but the little girl was anxious to wipe her tears and did not notice what he said. "But we're going to there!" After a while, the boy said excitedly, "We're going to Hogwarts!"

The girl nodded and wiped her eyes. No matter what, she still smiled. The girl seemed to be cheered up by the news as well. "You'd better go to Slytherin!" The black-haired boy said. "Slytherin?" When the two boys who were chatting heard this word, they turned their gazes to them. 

Then, the next four people quarreled about Slytherin and Gryffindor. 

Sure enough, if Slytherin met Gryffindor, there wouldn't have a peaceful life. Joe helplessly lifted her head from the magazine. Feeling the strange gaze, the quarreling freshmen remembered that they weren't the only ones in the carriage. 

The seemingly lazy boy was the first to say, "Looks like we're interrupting senior sister, but you're probably used to the Gryffindor-Slytherin fight." "My name is James Potter. This is my good friend Sylvie Black. We are in the first grade," the glasses boy answered. Joe nodded and got back to the magazine. 

James Potter was embarrassed for a moment, as if he hadn't expected Joe to be so cold. The black-haired boy sneered. Sylvie Black shrugged and muttered, "It could be a Slytherin." 

"No." 

Joe added another number to the complex question, "I'm a Gryffindor, but ..." She raised her head and smiled at the four of them. She was very gentle and even had a shy smile on her face. "My name is Joe Mead. You won't want to know me." Sure enough, Sylvie Black's expression changed when he heard Joe's name. 

Even James Potter had a somewhat familiar expression. He looked at Sirius for confirmation and realized that he had nodded at him before coming to a sudden realization. 

Only the red-haired girl and the black-haired boy were confused. 

James Potter and Sylvie Black gave up chatting up on Joe and focused their attention on the two people beside them. Soon, they quarreled again. 

Finally, the red-haired girl blushed. She stood up and looked at James and Sirius with disgust. "Let's go, Severus. Let's find another carriage." "Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh ..." 

James and Siris mimicked her arrogant tone, and James tried to trip the black-haired boy as he passed by. "See you later, Snot Essence!" James shouted at the door. The carriage door was shut with a bang. 

James and Siris looked at each other and burst into laughter. Then they started a new topic and fell into a heated discussion. However, he didn't say a word to Joe. The three of them seemed to be separated by a transparent wall. 

Joe was satisfied with the situation, but the quill in her hand paused for a moment, thinking of the girl calling the black-haired boy by the name Severus. 

In front of Nightingale's carriage, Joe greeted the mysterious creature with a smile. Sitting in the same carriage with her were two Hitchpatches and one Ravenclaw. 

A small, round-faced Hufflepuff hesitated for a long time before stammering, "You ... know how to divine, don't you?" The other two girls seemed to be startled by her question. One hurriedly pulled on the little man's sleeve, signaling her to stop talking, while the other looked at Joe in horror. 

Qiao smiled obediently, like a shy and introverted little girl from a neighbor's house. She took out a deck of poker cards from her pocket and nimbly shuffled the cards with her slender white fingers. Then, she spread them out in a fan shape and handed them to the little man. "It's not convenient to get on the carriage. Let's use this. Do you want to test love? Take one based on your instincts." 

"Alice, no!" 

"It's too dangerous to make a deal with her!" Joe did not refute, but looked at her quietly, her eyes gentle, her expression shy and amiable, as if it was Christmas time to share candy with friends. 

Hearing her friend's words, Alice hesitated for a moment, but she finally mustered up her courage and took out a card from Joe's hand. 

'"Diamond Three." Joe looked at her card and explained in a cheerful voice, "You're in the second grade. You'll have to wait for two years and six months before he comes to you. After that, no matter what tribulations you go through, the two of you will always be together." 

Alice's face turned red. Her expression was a little regretful, but she was still happier. 

"Thank you! ... What do you want?" After getting the answer, it was time to talk about remuneration. Joe looked at the nervous Hufflepuff girl in front of her with her bright gray eyes and said, "I want ... Phil Rhizome, can you take some to me?" 

"Those are the herbs only available in the professor's herbal garden! How can ordinary students get them?" Another Hufflepuff girl retorted. Joe shrugged her shoulders carelessly and put away the rest of the cards. 

"Alright! A week later, next to the Black Lake!" Alice clenched her teeth and agreed. Joe smiled shyly at her, as if she had expected that she would not refuse. 

The auditorium was brightly lit, and Joe chose a corner to sit down. She was a little hungry. In the teacher's seat, the white-haired Principal Dumbledore wore a purple robe. He crossed his hands and stared at the ceiling, as if he was swimming in the sky. 

Professor Slughorn, who taught magic potions, was excitedly talking to Professor Flitwick, the little guy beside him. They would always be able to choose the most comfortable sitting position. Dean Gryffindor, Professor McGonagall's seat is empty. She should be picking up the freshmen. 

Just as Joe thought of this, the door to the auditorium opened. Under the guidance of Professor McGonagall, who was dressed in a green robe, the little adepts, who had formed a line of their own accord, walked into the hall with nervousness and excitement.

Among them, the boy named Siris Black in the train was particularly conspicuous because of his handsome appearance. 

Professor McGonagall put the triangle stool and sorting hat in front of everyone as usual, and under the eyes of everyone, the dirty and worn old hat grinned and began to sing. 

Joe followed Dumbledore's example, crossed her hands, held chin, and looked at the new students with curiosity. They were about to be divided into different academies by the hat, perhaps the brave Gryffindor, perhaps the intelligent Ravenclaw, or the diligent Herchipatch-and, of course, the bloodline-savvy Slytherin. 

Joe's gaze swept past the little heads, and the freshmen were anxiously waiting for the sorting ceremony to begin. They did not notice that a corner of the long table in Gryffindor had a pair of bright grey eyes looking at them with interest. There was not a second more, not a second less, whether it was James Potter with messy hair or the little beauty with red hair and green eyes. 

Joe's gaze paused slightly. The little black-haired boy was skinny and expressionless, but his pitch-black eyes shone with excitement. Then he noticed Joe's gaze and met Joe's eyes. Joe smiled at him, and he immediately turned around arrogantly and indifferently. 

Sure enough, he hated all Gryffindors. Professor McGonagall read the list and the freshmen went to the triangular stools one by one and put the sorting hat on their heads. 

When James Potter, Sirius Black (Joe saw a senior girl on Slytherin's long table about to jump up in rage), Remus Lupin, Lily Evans (the red-haired girl, the black-haired boy sighed when the sorting hat called out her academy) ... When they parted into Gryffindor, the whole table burst into cheers. 

Joe also clapped her hands with the crowd. The arrival of the new students was of course a good thing. Then ... Joe waited for Professor McGonagall to pronounce the name Severus Snape. Joe's eyes lit up. It was indeed him.

** I would highly recommended getting a beta reader or downloading a free grammer tool, such as grammarly, to help you edit. I've found that even the spell check in google docs can catch some misused and misspelled words, so if you don't want to go out of your way, that's also a good option. Honestly, this is rather difficult to follow as is. I would recommend googling how to properly indent dialogue so it's easier to follow. Also, there's a lot of jumping around in perspective and descriptions, which is confusing. Some of the descriptions make it unclear whether children or teens are being described, so also be careful with that. The use of freshman/sophomore is a bit misleading unless you are going for a university style AU.

I hope this helps!
