I've seen this prompt in various locations, and I was wondering if anybody has written it?

Basically, for those who haven't come across it, GR tends to act really angry when experienced (chefs) potion makers make mistakes but is really gentle and patient with kids just starting out. I just want to see that in a Hogwarts environment.

  Inspired by a post on Tumblr, this is a AU story set during Harry's sixth year at Hogwarts, with one big, foul-mouthed difference. Instead of Horace Slughorn, the position of Potions professor will be taken on by...Gordon Ramsay.
