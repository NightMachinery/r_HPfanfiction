Hello everyone. I just finished reading a Spanish fanfic named "No hay vuelta atrás" where snape istead of joing the death eaters simply decides to leave Britain and start a new life. Do you know any other fic where something like this happens (It doesn't matter if It's before or after the First Wizarding war)??

For the curious the link to "no hay vuelta atras " is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10318326/1/No-hay-vuelta-atr%C3%A1s][this!]]


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10645463/1/Hail-Odysseus][Hail Odysseus]], linkffn(10645463): Snape ended up selling potions in Texas, well-tanned and married to a pretty Mexican.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7670834/1/Come-Once-Again-and-Love-Me][Come Once Again and Love Me]], linkffn(7670834): Time travel. He and Lily ran off after sending hints about Horcruxes to Dumbledore.

  Severus wakes up in the afterlife expecting something rather different than being almost-seventeen again. Seriously, what kind of game is this? But wait - Lily's come back, too - from 1981? Perhaps it's a second chance... but to do what? SS/LE

  After believing that Harry Potter died in a house fire at the age of ten, the Wizarding world is shocked when he emerges, out of the blue, just in time to attend his seventh year at Hogwarts. They're even more shocked when he's Sorted into Slytherin.

** It happens in 'A Cadmean Victory'. Involuntary forced exile in Book 6. This story isn't about Snape though.
