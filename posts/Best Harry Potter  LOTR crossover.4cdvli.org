I've seen lots of weird (but good) crossovers that are from wholly different genres, such as Ironman or Jurassic Park that are more Sci-Fi, but never one for LOTR. So what are the best Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings crossovers?


** linkffn(The Shadow of Angmar)

No contest.

linkffn(The Power He Knows Not)

By the same author is also very good, and complete.

*** The Power he knows not is without the shadow of a doubt the best LOTR/HP crossover there is, thanks mainly to how well the author as managaged to imitate Tolkien's writing style, making this story a very unusal but good read. I can't reccomend it enough!

***** Yeah I read it, but I liked it a lot less. It's true that his portrayal of Saruman was very good, but I didn't like it as much. I know it's pretty weird, but...It just didn't felt like middle Earth to me, contrary to his other work. And I don't really like his Harry either, but it's indeniably well written. My dislike is more on the personal side of things.

  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

  A decade ago Harry Potter found himself in a beautiful and pristine land. After giving up hope of finding his friends he settled upon the wide plains below the mountains. Peaceful years pass before a Ranger brings an army to his door and he feels compelled once again to fight. Perhaps there is more to be found here than solitude alone. Harry/Éowyn.

There used to be a decent long one where Neville and Molly get sent to Middle earth, but i cant find it anymore. There is another that i remember where Harry decides not to fight, but does healing instead, with Harry playing music as an important plot element. Alas, i cant remember enough to find this one either.

  There were just some things a witch shouldn't do, especially if you're the savior of the Wizarding world. Like getting drunk, semi-kidnapping your godchild, become queen of the goblins after winning a drunken brawl with the previous king in a foreign world and not remembering any of it the next day. Harry swears she'll never drink again. Sort of.

  After the Second Wizarding War, Harry goes to Middle Earth for a little R&R away from it all. He was told it was peaceful. He was wrong. He then spends four years fighting in the North. When the Ring is discovered, a war for the sake of two worlds begins with Harry at it's centre. I own neither LOTR or Harry Potter and would be a good deal richer if I did. THE SEQUEL IS NOW UP.
