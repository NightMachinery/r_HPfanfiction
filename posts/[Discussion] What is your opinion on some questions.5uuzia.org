** Am I easily overwhelmed by long lists of questions?

Yes.

Seriously though, if you want people to answer all these you might want to make an online survey and make some of these multiple choice answers. If you got lots of responses to this that addressed every question (which is probably your ideal scenario) then it's be a nightmare to sort through.

I'll just answer #4 and say that Harry was definitely neglected which is a type of abuse. Also taking a swing at your nephew with a frying pan is never ok and may or may not indicate physical assault happened off scene. Also, emotional abuse is very real and was a part of what Harry experienced.

** u/Bob_Bobinson:
#+begin_quote
  What is your favorite genre of fics?
#+end_quote

Comedy and fantasy epics (the latter being as sweeping as canon).

#+begin_quote
  Favorite characterization of Harry? Least favorite?
#+end_quote

Favorite: Flawed Harry, with his own issues and problems as he struggles through the world. Least: Super!God!Lord!Hadrian!Potter!Black!Jesus

#+begin_quote
  What would you change about any of the characters in canon to make them better?
#+end_quote

Dumbledore is more proactive in the first couple of books to match his later proactivity in the later books. Ginny is given more than a half-dozen scenes. Voldemort does more evil stuff.

#+begin_quote
  Would you keep Harry in Gryffindor or would you put him in Slytherin?
#+end_quote

Depends. If Harry goes on adventures, it's the former. If he is all about political schemes and whatnot (leaving the adventuring to the more foolhardy folks), like a distaff Cersei, he belongs in the latter.

#+begin_quote
  What level of abuse do you think Harry saw as a child?
#+end_quote

Enough to call Child Protective Services, or whatever the UK equivalent is. Canon Harry I don't think was ever raped or beaten bloody. But he was mistreated. Not starved, no, but mistreated nevertheless.

#+begin_quote
  How many people do you think are in magical Britain in canon? How many do you think should be there? How many do you think should be in the entire world as a whole?
#+end_quote

I'd wager a little more than a 100,000 in canon. To make things a little spicier, I'd add a million to UK, make Diagon Alley a mini-London within London (shrinking charms galore). In the whole world, 100 million.

#+begin_quote
  How do you think wizarding culture should be? How would it be different in other countries?
#+end_quote

Regal and Victorian, given that wizards live for ages (a lot of wizards lived through Queen Victoria's reign). Same goes for other countries.

#+begin_quote
  Should there be or less harem stories with Harry having a 10 foot cock and a few hundred virgins?
#+end_quote

If it's comedy, more. If it's serious, less.

#+begin_quote
  What is the most disturbing story that you have read?
#+end_quote

Princess of the Blacks by Silently Watches. No spoilers, but damn.

#+begin_quote
  How large should Voldemort's forces be?
#+end_quote

About 3'50".

#+begin_quote
  Why is Ron such a petty ass? Should there be more or less bashing on him?
#+end_quote

He's a teenager. Teens are petty. More bashing if it's comedy and crack, less if it's serious. He was a cool dude in canon.

#+begin_quote
  What is the secret behind Dumbledore's lemon drops and does he have sexual relations with Snape over the summer?
#+end_quote

It's Goblin crack, and, no. Snape only loves Harry's dead mom.

#+begin_quote
  How much money would the Weasley family take to spy on Harry for Dumbles if?
#+end_quote

I don't think Dumbledore would make a teenager or gaggle of them into spies. He'd employ less obvious techniques of surveillance, like actual bugs.

#+begin_quote
  Would your perfect version of Harry be more or less inclined to move to France?
#+end_quote

Less. Harry doesn't know French.

** I like romance/angsty post-battle stuff. I like it because a) the relationships in the series were very important to the development of the characters, especially Harry, yet we don't actually get much about them and b)i think there are a lot of really interesting stories to be told right after the battle and felt Rowling made a mistake not having more of a "Cool down" period right after the battle before flashing forward to 19 years later.

I like a Harry that is a bit more proactive but not some god of knowledge. But I kind of like him in canon so I don't mind if there is no change. I least like a Harry that falls too far into the blaming himself mentality and self-sabotages himself. It's interesting for Harry to feel unworthy of anything good based on his childhood, but reading about him constantly torpedoing the good things in life is too depressing.

I'd have a lot more of Ginny, starting in OOTP but also in HBP and ABSOLUTELY in DH. Ginny is supposed to be an independent fiery character, and is in some cases, but I would have had her challenge Harry more when he breaks it off, and then playing a larger role in DH, or at least have Rowling show her larger role in the leading of the DA. Also would have had her break up with Dean much earlier and show more of the relationship with Harry. The length of her relationship with Dean and not pursuing Harry when she supposedly is a fiery woman who goes after what she wants almost implies she was fine to wind up with Dean and Harry and her came together more out of timing than destiny. I like to believe there was some magic between them.

I keep him in Gryffindor as it better fits his character and I loved the series so why mess with such a fundamental aspect of it. Though him in Slytherin offers plenty of great alternative stories.

The abuse portrayed in the first few books was treated as almost comical, ala a Roald Dahl book, so we were never meant to take it too seriously or realistic. In order to keep it realistic in her world, however, you have to assume there were no beatings. I would argue the mental abuse he suffered was almost worse, but people in general equate abuse with physical altercations. Honestly, I'm not sure about my thoughts on his level abuse.

To effectively keep the separation between wizards and muggles, you can't have too many wizards. Hogwarts is a very small school to take in all kids in the UK. Even factoring in the home schooled kids, I'm guessing not more than low 5 figures. I'm fine with that number. The 100,000 at the World Cup suggests there are perhaps a few million in the whole world. It's tough to make any accurate assumptions as Rowling was all over the place canonically.

How is wizarding culture or how should it be? It's pretty messed up, with the subjugation and separation of certain magical creatures. The whole pureblood ideaology being allowed to permeate culture is really wrong, and it speaks to a culture that is still at least several decades behind muggle society. Then again, women play a more equal role in society, so there are some elements of their culture that is progressive.

Less.

I am self-selecting enough to avoid stories that are overtly disturbing. So I guess stories that involve rape or stories with extreme child abuse on the part of the Dursleys are amongst the most disturbing I read and I really hate when I come across them. Rowling created a world where such things as sexual assault are just not a thing. I firmly believe that.

I think in the Battle, there were around a hundred, right? I imagine there would realistically be many more, as I think wizarding society was open to the idea that purebloods were superior.

Levels of danger, I think you need to treat magical beasts who don't show a legitimate level of intelligence like muggles do. Centaurs are equally intelligent to wizards so they shouldn't be regulated as magical beasts.

Ron is very grey. He has plenty of moments where he stands by Harry and willingly follows him into danger. and then there are those two major moments where he turns his back on him. On a day to day basis, he is often a jerk to Hermione but then also defends her and treats her right. Probably his biggest sin is the way he isolated Ginny her first year. I'm fine with people bashing him but also people who treat him well. Can go both ways, but canonically Ron is a good, albeit flawed, guy.

Eh?

None. The fact that they remain close to him despite the dangers that come with being friends with Harry tells you all you need to know.

Less inclined. Not sure he ever thought about it, but I want the Harry we got, one who fought for what was right.

Otherwise that year at Hogwarts under the Carrows is a horror on another level, and I refuse to believe Rowling would allow that to happen.

Edit:

Ravleen: How much does the fact that voldemort was conceived under a love potion have to do with his nonability to understand love is it more symbolic

J.K. Rowling: It was a symbolic way of showing that he came from a loveless union -- but of course, everything would have changed if Merope had survived and raised him herself and loved him.

** What is your favorite genre of fics? Adventure w/a soupçon of romance and horror.

Favorite characterization of Harry? Least favorite? Mine. The lie i've lived's.

What would you change about any of the characters in canon to make them better? Harry is initially showed as being keen on education. Then he starts acting like ron.

Would you keep Harry in Gryffindor or would you put him in Slytherin? No slytherin!harry.

What level of abuse do you think Harry saw as a child? Neglect retconned in book 2 and on, but worse in book 1 before genreshift.

How many people do you think are in magical Britain in canon? How many do you think should be there? How many do you think should be in the entire world as a whole? 1/1000 to 1/777 per muggle population. 1/777 worldwide.

How do you think wizarding culture should be? How would it be different in other countries? Static to how the muggles were there when the statute was signed.

Should there be or less harem stories with Harry having a 10 foot cock and a few hundred virgins? Less.

What is the most disturbing story that you have read? Too many to name.

How large should Voldemort's forces be? A two digit prime number or one divisible by 7.

What types of classification for creatures should there be?

Why is Ron such a petty ass? Should there be more or less bashing on him? Jealousy. No, write him out or rewrite him.

What is the secret behind Dumbledore's lemon drops and does he have sexual relations with Snape over the summer? Two very different questions pinned together. Lemon Sherbet Drops are in fact how he ingests lsd. If he does, it's to reinforce horrible memories for snape to make him have more reasons to not misbehave and get sent to azkaban so he doesn't relive his forced sodomization and a2m and tossing dumbledore's salad.

How much money would the Weasley family take to spy on Harry for Dumbles if? For the greater good bs. Drop it and write a better storyline.

Would your perfect version of Harry be more or less inclined to move to France? Less unless a veela clan invited him for sexy times.

Would you add in the Sorting Hat character from The Lie I've Lived) to your story and/or canon? No. Fuck that story.

  Favorite characterization of Harry? Least favorite?
#+end_quote

i like canon harry but smarter but not too smart for his age and more social(he knows barely anything about his year mates and is on a boarding school, i dislike overly moral and emotional harry( harry in canon used the unforgiveables and kille death eaters without a moment of regret he isn't a saint and surely no golden boy, and harry

#+begin_quote
  What would you change about any of the characters in canon to make them better?
#+end_quote

I would make Snape more neutral in the class room and more like a reformed death eater should look like , if he wants to look like a spy for Voldemort he is doing the wrong thing, a spy would keep his head down and help the slytherins in private by tutoring and advising them. i would still have him glare and dislike harry but not be so public about it. I would also have him teach dueling or theories of the dark arts as an elective in third year instead of potions a position he seems to hate.

#+begin_quote
  Would you keep Harry in Gryffindor or would you put him in Slytherin?Slytherin, I think slytherin is better for interesting story telling, the inner conflict is interesting when the parents of harrys friends turn to voldemort and they have to make a choice

  What level of abuse do you think Harry saw as a child?
#+end_quote

Enough for people to talk to the Dursleys but not enough to belive harry more than them. He should be getting enough food to not need medical attention but not enoug for him to be as healthy as he could be, he should be occasinally hit but not beaten enoug that he has many bruises or broken bones, the dursleys should ignore him more than insult him. he should be locked in his cupboar and deprived a meal or two for accidental magic

#+begin_quote

rowling says there are 3000 wizards and witches in brittian. With the ammount of infrastructure weve seen i would say 100.000 or 200.000 is better but i would spread it to 3 dozen magical villages half a dozen magical towns and 1 or 2 magical cities. I would add additinal magic shools and have hogwarts hold 4200 students that would be 600 for every year and 150 for every house so you have each year 15 new classes of 10 that can have classes with other houses, Of course you would have to add a bunch of staff to hogwarts

#+begin_quote
  How do you think wizarding culture should be? How would it be different in other countries?
#+end_quote

It should be similar to Victorian era but there should be no sexism or human racism, It shouldn't be a culture stuck in the past but a different one. there should be no discrimination for half blood because they are the majority and muggleborns should be treated with doubt but people who arent blood purist will gladly aknowledge one with power. There was a muggleborn minister of magic in canon and a female one in 1798, so woman shouldnt be treated like cattle that needs their husbands permission to work. I think overall it should be a society that acknowledges power as most important and follows the most powerful. like dumbledore and grindewald

#+begin_quote
  Should there be or less harem stories with Harry having a 10 foot cock and a few hundred virgins?
#+end_quote

harem is okay if its done well what i havent seen much yet. its okay if its harry having a girlfriend and cheating on her and maybe feeling bad about him (human problems) or if its so he can get political allies. But i dislike it if he is simply collecting woman because of writers wish fulfillment

#+begin_quote
  What is the most disturbing story that you have read?

A story about harry being raped with a love potion and impregnating Daphne green grass. The author honestly blamed harry and defended himself by saying that Merope Guant raped Tom Riddle Sr. I was really disturbed by the way the author really believed that

#+begin_quote
  How large should Voldemort's forces be?
#+end_quote

at the battle of hogwarts i would say 500-800 dementors, 100-150 werwolves, 200-500 vampires, 10-30 giants, probably 100 goblins( there are probably many goblins who joined him for profit),200-300 wizards under the imperius, 150-200 death eaters, 500-800 regualar thugs that want to earn some money, 100 snatchers, and 100-200 ministry workers loyal to Voldemort

#+begin_quote
  What types of classification for creatures should there be?
#+end_quote

spirits(dementors,ghosts,girmm,boggarts and stuff like that) creatures( anything that isnt cappable of having its own oppinion) beings ( house-elfes, goblins, dwarfes, centaurs. merpeople) i would add a number of 1-10 to show how dangerous they are

#+begin_quote
  Why is Ron such a petty ass? Should there be more or less bashing on him?
#+end_quote

less bashing if he is harrys friend ( the boy is more than ones ready to die for harry and risks his life for him, them having a fight and not talking for a couple of weeks like friend occasinally do doesnt change that. I am ok with a bit of bashing if he and harry never were friends because Ron is a little biased against slytherins and has a temperament and is jealous

#+begin_quote
  What is the secret behind Dumbledore's lemon drops and does he have sexual relations with Snape over the summer?
#+end_quote

I say the lemon drops are to see if someone trusts him enough to eat something from him and to see if you are hostile to muggle sweets or objets. no to the sexual relation, i my mind dumbledore is chief warlock and Supreme Mugwump and a researcher he doesent have time for any form of nonprofessional relation ship

#+begin_quote
  How much money would the Weasley family take to spy on Harry for Dumbles if?
#+end_quote

A lot the weasleys have ethics and he would have to convince them that its the best for harry, probably by mentioning that voldemort left a piece of himself in harry and he cant know that yeat but someone has to make sure he is well. Honestly i think if Dumbledore spins this right he doesn't have to pay them anything

#+begin_quote
  Would your perfect version of Harry be more or less inclined to move to France?

Less if he knows about the prophecy and has people he cares about in brittian, more if he only has a hanfull of friends he only knew for a couple months and knows nothing about him being fated to kill voldemort

** 1) depends on how I feel at any given time.

B)I can't think of a favourite. Unlike a lot of people though I actually don't mind am OOC character Harry especially in an AU setting so ling as its explained and makes sense. It has to have a reason for something to have changed.

III) I'll need a clarification in the word better to give you a good answer, ate you asking about more power, to act closer to how I think they should, to make them more how I want?

4) Goes back to my answer for 1) I'm not bothered so long as there is reasoning I can follow. Harry pre sorting was told all bad wizards come from Slytherin and Voldemort was great, terrible but great. When the hat offers him a chance a greatness then he might well have been terrified and not just of sharing dorm room with Malloy. If you want him in Slytherin you need to change what led to that. Simply not having Hagrid randomly appointed to be his guide probably accomplishes that.

V)Over 9000. No idea how to quantify abuse.

F) 100 years (average life expectancy despite wars?) x 40 (rough year size from Harry's year.) =400 total. Clearly too small. Either class sizes where much larger before the war or there are other schools in Britain but Hogwarts is the best or there are several more people in Harry's year that are never mentioned. Slytherin and Gryffindor take some special traits to get into, Hufflepuff will take anyone who wants to work hard and have some friends whereas Ravenclaw will accept anyone who wants to do well in class. Stands to reason there will be massively uneven house sizes to me. Either way we've lost a lot of people in the maths. There should be thousands in Britain but not too many if they all sort of know each other.

7)Wizarding culture will have been shaped by its history of which we know little about meaning we have to go with what we see in the books and try to extrapolate information. Of we set fire to the source and wind back to the medieval because we can god damn it, not because its a good idea by any means but because they can. Oh dear. With regards to other cultures, well they could do but I don't want them to. Why? Because Britain is the home of Hogwarts, the premier school for magic in the world, home of Merlin and the founders. This place is the world leader in magic, I don't need more stories about how USA is the greatest country in the world and how they are so much more progressive and better in every way and Hogwarts is backwards. Frankly those stories sound petty and awful, I've never made it to the end of one.

VIII) with the exception of Noodlehammer's current one most Harem stories can be removed from the fandom with nothing lost.

Losing the will to answer properly so I will just say we have the XXXXX creature rating system for dangerous beasts. After fourth year Harry being invited to go stay with the Delacours in France as a thank you for what he did in the second task is a plot point I want explored more. You can even throw in the strange Veela maturity thing that some fics have and make Gabrielle 13/14 if you want but either way Harry Potter has never had a holiday.

** Far too many questions on too many different topics. Especially because a lot of questions are so open-ended. For the most part, you could post one discussion thread a day until you've gone through all your questions.

Changing a canon character needs clarification. Make canon better while still keeping it canon, e.g. making Arthur Weasley a bit less clueless about muggle stuff? Or change canon significantly, e.g. Snape not hating Harry? Would expanding the role of Ginny or of some empty-name characters (Daphne Greengrass) count as changing a character? Or is this already changing canon?

Most disturbing fic just had a thread a few days ago.

Giving an opinion about the "The Lie I've lived" Sorting Hat would be way easier if you included a description of that Sorting Hat.

** 1.  Action/Adventure, really into stories with a lot of Duelling scenes, and also going into the depths of magic through adventuring.

2.  My favorite characterization is Loner!Harry, my least favorite is Independent!Harry. While some may see them as one in the same, I kind of have to disagree. In Indy!Harry fics, he is constantly around people, he swaps the Golden-Trio for a Platinum Trio, and it all gets very boring. Meanwhile, Loner Harry gives us a more in-depth look into his psyche, and how he thinks.

3.  Harry having common sense. People accepting that Hermione isn't the brightest witch of her age, she just memorizes books. I would also like a more active Dumbledore.

4.  Slytherin, most definitely.

5.  In truth? I don't think he was abused at all, I think in the real story, Dudley didn't even exist and Petunia raised him as she would a son. It was he that could never reciprocate the feeling due to his detachment with the Muggle world. Living without magic after being exposed to it, even for one second, is very hard.

6.  Magical Britain definitely has an above-average magical population, the ministry was supposed to be teeming with wizards, even in the Dark times of the second war. I don't think I could put it in exact numbers, however. I think that the amount of people in Britain is quite alright for such a small country. There should definitely be more throughout the world, if the Daily Prophet would rather front page Harry Potter getting into the Tri-Wizard tournament, world news must be lacking.

7.  I think wizarding culture is okay as is, although the robes are highly unnecessary, most modern mages are viewed as tall and thin, wearing vests or blazers. I doubt that they would make children walk around in heavy cloaks all the time. America would definitely be more industrialized, more technologically reliant, but their line between Dark and Light magic would be just as strong as Britain's. In fact, I think the same would reign true throughout the world, until we get to the African continent. That is, afterall, where the concepts of Voodoo and Black Magic originated from in modern day.

8.  Less, this isn't Japan.

9.  Lie I've Lived had Dumbledore stripped up naked and cut in half, doesn't get more disturbing than that for me.

10. Creature-Wise, it would definitely be huge, Voldemort always had an affinity for dark creatures. But people-wise is definitely the problem, I think that he would still be able to amass a hefty amount of followers, but not as many as before.

11. Classifications? I don't really know, I thought that the X XX XXX classifications were good enough.

12. I have no idea, I guess that was Rowling's poor characterization. I always assumed that he would go Dark in the end. Less bashing, I would rather not have him in the story to be bashed in the first place.

13. The Sherbet Lemons have no real significance, he doesn't really eat them a lot in canon, just offering them at odd times. No, I like to think of Dumbledore as being Asexual, rather than homosexual as Rowling unnecessarily added in her pseudo-character building attempts for the furthering of her liberal agenda.

14. None, the Weasleys aren't those types of people. They have rotten luck with money, but they aren't bad.

15. Less, he would know that Britain needs him, and that a Hogwarts education is better than a Beauxbatons education. While I'm sure they have an excellent charms program, I think they also have unnecessary etiquette classes, or something like that.

16. Not really, he seems more like a gimmick in that story. Not something that should exist in actual canon.

*** You're thinking of the wrong Dumbledore towards the end there. That was clearly his brother who does that.
