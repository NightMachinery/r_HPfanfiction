I mean last chapters of DH, harry's death and pretending to be dead. I need his emotions, thoughts, reaction. Obviously, survived!Snape. Good!Snape or Canon!Snape.

I've read it only once, it was in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8461843/1/Heart-of-the-Guardian][Heart of the Guardian]]


** This exact thing is an /extremely/ powerful moment - one amongst a LOT in linkffn(Backwards with Purpose.)

God, I love that fic.
