I'm quite happily finding more and more discussions within this community about what magical nations might have existed presently, depending on which route you take with magic vs muggle interactions and overall historical accuracy and influence.

Simply put I wanted to see a collected thread on all of your thoughts, because I've just wasted the last 4 hours delving through my own books as well as the wider net to create my own headcanon and have ended up with more questions then answers.


** I start with the rough borders of the 1600-1700s (though magical nations may not have been the same as muggle nations, such as Aztecs never falling in the wizarding world). From there I make up my own history (such as the Ottoman invasion of Europe being one of the reasons leading to the SoS being enacted), and draw borders around geographical lines (rivers, mountains) as well as unique cultures. In certain areas, there isn't much in the way of government but small independent wizarding tribes.

​

Here is a basic map I have done. It is far from complete:

*** I'm interested that the Papal state exists. I don't doubt that there are probably some religious wizards, and if the British Prime minister knows about magic then the Pope must know(and all that implies), but if the Papal state is the Papal state than the Pope runs magical Central Italy. What this might imply is that the Cardinals know as well and that there is a secret prerequisite that the Pope must be a Wizard, which seems fun.

I also just feel like Italian culture is a pretty recent thing. Most people felt attachment to their city state only. Unless the wizards have maintained a Wizarding Italy since the fall of Rome and the Lombards, they would also be split up by powerful city states.

**** The yellow blob is Russia, and is its own independent nation.

The black area next to Russia is independent tribes, such as the Mongols. However, they are lightly governed by the Russians (mostly to protect the SoS). As each tribe is different, children tend to be raised with their own brand of tribal magic.

In Siberia, haven't figured it out so much. It would be a great place for a wizarding nation to hide in secret as its sparsely populated... but at the same time, I wonder how much of a community it would have because it's so sparsely populated.

I'm going with about 3000 muggles for each wizard, so many muggle nations would not actually have a magical population to support itself. Canada is a good example where the Natives have their own wizarding populations but outside of that, its all just part of the magical USA.

Lastly, the pink blob around the Mediterranean is the Ottomans, which haven't fallen. The main reason for this is because I can't imagine the magical region to allow the partition of its lands by the British. The second reason is the fic I am currently writing is based in wizarding Constantinople.

I would love to write a short history on all the nations i've come up with and the reasoning why (empires can get larger and easier to maintain when you can teleport), but alas, that is a lot of work.

The map is unfinished and I haven't decided on what to do with Germany yet. In the 1700s it was all small dutchies, but they all have the Germany identity. Plus there is Prussia... Which isn't even in Germany...

And the map is finicky. I have to manually draw borders I cannot select nations, so if a bit of land is left out, that is usually why.

** My principal thought is that many people are often too rigid on this, essentially professing that the political geography of the magical world /must/ represent that of the Muggle world in 1692. There are two reasons why this does not have to be the case (and indeed probably isn't).

Firstly, it's unlikely that magical geography matched Muggle geography in 1692, so the starting point is already off. We know, for example, that magical Britain was ruled by the Wizard's Council since at least the 1200s. In contrast, Muggle Britain was not united under a single government until 1707. The Statute of Secrecy didn't /invent/ the separation of the magical and Muggle worlds, it merely deepened it.

Secondly, there's no reason why magical nations cannot continue to change over time. One thing I see frequently on this sub is the idea that the HRE must exist because the statute of secrecy predates the unification of Germany. But a common German cultural identity far predates the statute, and there were numerous concepts of German unification before the one that was successful (most notably, Austria's concept of a Greater Germany under Austrian leadership).

Given that magical Britain unified well before the Muggle counterpart, I think it's at least as likely that magical Germany unified before Muggle Germany did, potentially including Austria. Even if Germany was not unified before the Statute was passed, I see no reason why a parallel movement towards unification could not have occurred in the magical world, based on the longstanding concept of the German identity. After all, JKR has said that while events in the Muggle and magical world have separate causes and individuals at play, they tend to run in parallel.

Ultimately, I think it's impossible to distil a single, universal principle which can be applied like a formula to determine magical borders.

For example, MACUSA was formed before the Muggle US was independent, and there's no real indication that it was ever subject to the British Ministry of Magic. It's just that there were wizards in America, so they came together and decided to form a government for themselves.

So from that you might take it as a universal principle that while colonial migration of wizards took place, these colonies were effectively independent from day 1. But this principle is contradicted by the fact that we know that magical New Spain existed. So in some parts of the Americas, magical governments in Europe /did/ exercise colonial governance.

So there's no universal principle to the thing. You have to take it on a case by case basis.

*** What really messes with me is the muggle prime minister knowing about everything. While this might seem unrelated it brings up some international questions, is this a British policy or an ICW mandated part of the SOS. If it is the latter than if the borders (If such an idea can even apply to the magical world) don't match up, they overlap or there is no Magical country present in the muggle borders do multiple or neighboring Ministers inform the Head(s) of State.

In general it feels like Scottish Magical Britain doesn't differ much from Magical England, and Does it include any or ALL of Ireland? Whenever I try and think of the Authors intent it just does not feel like she put much emphasis on the actual state-hood of the Magical world, and focused more on the literal hidden society aspect of it. Instead of a real hidden Country existing beside the muggle one, it feels closer to caricature of a real country without the nitty-gritty aspects to flesh it out. Some things resemble the real world (some laws and people to enforce them, a vague ruling class, education, shopping district) while not actually explaining what the culture of the population or the full responsibilities and make up of the government are.

This is all especially highlighted in Rufus Scrimgeour. He's appointed Minister, but it's not clear what caused this, was it a parliament coalition, a emergency act, was there a formal succession or even an election we were not told about. People usually play up the entrenched noble house/sacred 28 families hold immense power, but that scenario can't be completely tossed out when nobody talks about elections. Even when the age of 17 is brought up as important it's about freedom of magic and not anything else. But what actual positions exist to be filled, Lucius is on the board of directors for Hogwarts, how, why, for how long. Then we have the mess that is their banking sector, possibly completely controlled by a third party race with a history of warring against the people whose money they control.

You're right, it can't be distilled to one constant, but I think it's because the entire idea of a Magical *World* is uninteresting to Rowling compared to a Magical /School/ and all a Magical school needs to exist. A school needs supplies which needs a place to get supplies, a school needs a person running it and a person running it needs someone to run them, A school needs students which need parents which need jobs and homes which needs someone to keep the peace. It's all that simple, what Rowling needs for her School and her Villain to exist and not a lot more.

*** But the whole reason that the HRE fell apart (the reformation, which led to the thirty year's war) is irrelevant for the magical world. I mean, I doubt that Christianity would appeal to the magical people since Hogwarts students can replicate almost all miracles by the time they graduate. Additionally, with abilities like apparation, the 1/3 death toll of the general population would not devastate the magical community in the same way it did the regular World.

Without those divides and deaths, the HRE is a way stronger force, more akin to the modern EU than the shadow it was when Napoleon delivered the final blow. And most of the unification ideas came from the lack of central power in the vacuum after 1815. It is commonly accepted here in Germany that the first real unification sentiments came up in the Hambacher Fest 1832, which was preceeded by a few years of turmoil. The 1848 revolution also should not influence the magical world since the social issues should be irrelevant with magic and the Holy League was a muggle alliance.

The HRE should be a stronger force under one of the Electors (not necessarily Austria), but still a union of states like the early US and not one unified nation. And given that post WWII any nationalistic sentiment has been purged from here and people still put a lot of emphasis on regional identity, most muggleborns would be content with being Saxon/Bavarian/Swabian and German in name only.

**** I can see a protestant HRE for the magical world actually. Modern Protestants would be alot more lax about magic than Catholics especally if someone claimed Magic is just a gift of God. Hell that could be how the magical world in the HRE started, with the reformation where peoples who used to practice magic all the time until The Catholic Church forced them into hiding would make a Magical Protestant church that is basically christianity but Jesus was a wizard chosen by God instead of born to God or something like that

***** While the AU I use has an entirely protestant magical Empire, that was just a power move to boot out the Roman Influence from the HRE and the "30-years war" was just booting them out within a week (while the Muggles still battled on for another 30 years). But Early Protestants were also very active when it comes to witch hunts, so there was no benefit in any Christian Church of that time. The one difference was that the Catholics were more "equal" when it came to witch hunts with a 60w/40m gender split while the Protestants burned 85% women.

*** I definitely agree with the tendency of this sub to essentially c/p their way through this process, but I can accept that given a few reasons:

• It is exceptionally hard (as you've referred to) to find an acceptable method of establishing magical borders when looking at muggle history alone. This can lead to;

• Using the starting point of the implementation of the SOS in 1692 (or roughly around the turn of the century). It might not hold up to close scrutiny, but for many it is one of the first plausible event(s) in the canon timeline that can give them a kickstart, at least in greater Europe if not also Asia and Russia;

• I've also personally dealt with - as have others I've seen via author admission, tumblr, this subreddit etc. - the concern of insulting anyone's value of heritage, culture and ethnic representation.

In saying all of this, I absolutely agree on the conclusion that it needs to be a case by case basis to be satisfactory.

** In my headcanon, Magical Australia and New Zealand became sovereign and independent of British governance before the Muggle equivalent passed through the British parliamentary process.

Australia and NZ had native magical communities that isolated themselves upon British colonisation, and were able to act as the seeds of a mixed magical community for displaced immigrant wizards and witches who settled in Aus/NZ to escape the entrenched cronyism, nepotism, and blood politics of Europe. Whereas the British Muggles fought and wiped out a bunch of native communities, and instituted their Terra Nullius, or "Finder's Keepers" policies, where they got to snatch up and parcel out land because "no one owned it", and native ownership didn't count as legitimate.

In modern day Australia, many aboriginal wizards prefer to live in their outback settlements, while European-background wizards prefer to mingle in the local version Diagon Alley in the big cities, but many study and train with the native elders. In modern day NZ, indigenous tribes keep their customs, and while they are not entirely friendly to white "pakeha" wizards, give respect if their customs and traditions are respected. The Magical NZ government is bilingual, and "halfblood" as a slang term refers to mixed-race wizards rather than mixed Magical-Muggle, as indigenous wizards commonly marry non-Maj's from their communities, and magic is an open secret in their settlements.

It's not a perfect system, with more of a "Federalist" system between various regions, like the Swiss cantons, than one central government as in Magical Britain. But it's more peaceful than what the Muggle British colonial settlers did, especially in Australia, as magic became an equalising factor between Europeans and native magicals. And in the current day, young wizards and witches are trained in a culturally immersive environment that helps bring together the various native and non-native cultures and identities.

** I was just working on the political map of Europe at the start of the fanfiction I am writing and here it is: [[https://imgur.com/a/tAnFSU5]]

I already wrote down the lore of the Magical Council of Scandinavia, which started as a feudal dictatorship of various families which retreated in secrecy when Christianity started to replace Norse faith and Magic was condemned. When wizards started to realize the abuses and injustices they were suffering under these wizard feudal lords (which had no central government to watch them), they started to get angry, so the lords came up with a plan to bring their domains into an almost state of war with the goblins, and use the crisis to cement their rule and establish the Council. To this day, Scandinavia is still a corporate dictatorship.

The purple blob in the middle of Europe is The Empire. Essentially, the wizarding version of HRE, but much more centralized. I also just took stuff from Dragon Age, hence its governing body is called the Magisterium, and its rulled by an Arch-Mage. I already wrote down quite a bit of lore about them too, especially the Imperial patronage of Durmstrang.

The Hellenic Confederacy, the blue blob controlling Greece, Turkey and other parts of the Mediterranean world, was established way back when, during Alexander the Great's conquests. They are the oldest magical government in Europe, and the most open to Muggleborns. The Magical Academy of Athens is the oldest magical school in Europe, and fourth oldest in the world, but it lost a lot of its prestige under Roman/Byzantine rule. The Confederacy also banned Christianity after (muggle) Roman Emperor Theodosius the Great started hammering down on everything non christian and started killing Wizards. Going to the Confederacy is like travelling in time back to Classical Greece. When Turks started migrating in Anatolia and eventually conquered it, they also banned Islam and injected politics into the Athens Academy, which was now supposed to Hellenify every non-Greek citizen of the Confederacy.

The grey-ish circles around Bulgaria, Romania and Hungary are the Free Dacian Cities. Dacian Wizards always had a great sense of superiority over their Muggle brethren, and they were exclusively educated in Athens and Babylon. When Dacia fell to the Romans, they couldnt care less, and just withdrew in purely Magical cities, letting their ancestral lands be occupied by whoever pleased.

Panonia, the green blob centered around muggle Hungary is the most diverse place in Europe. Its as if someone threw Dacians, Huns, Slavs, Germanics and Hungarians into a blender, and the end result was Panonia. They also gave sanctuary to migrating Slavic wizards which got expelled from Magical Illyria (the yellow blob across Yugoslavia).

Bulgaria is, well, Bulgaria. Same for France. The Iberian peninsula is split among Celts, Basque and Spanish (which live in the same nation as the Portuguese). The idea was that I dont see why wizarding nations would, by default, be affected my Muggle migrations, since they can hide their very existence. So thats why there are still Dacians, Celts and the Roman Republic, in Italy. Magical Finland was established in order to resist expansionism attempts of Scandinavia, and its larger than muggle Finland. The Novgorod Federation pretty much expanded hand in hand with Kievan Rus, same like Poland.

Magical Britain is a bit more isolationist, and Pureblood families took advantage of Muggle England's expansion in order to increase their own domains.

The brown diamonds are Gringotts Bank offices.

I cant wait to get to the other continents, especially Asia because I have some really cool ideas about the Qing Empire and Chinese wizarding community in general.

*** That's why in my stories, witch hunts weren't the reason for the SoS, nor some shitty "oh, we don't want to be bothered by muggles so we'd rather go into hiding". They went into hiding because every seer in every culture had a vision - the alternative to hiding was Armageddon.

** I generally start with the borders of 1692, and then extrapolate depending on the needs of the story.

*** This was my starting point, too. There are a couple of other bits I take into account, like how in canon Transylvania appears to be a magical nation. I cheat a bit, in that it is easier on the writer to group together the smaller countries into larger ones; I justify this because of how small magical communities are. It would make sense for some of them to band together to pool resources. Partly because of this and partly due to the plans for a Greater Germany that Taure mentions above, I grouped those countries together in an area called the Zauberreich.

I also imagine that magicals tend to evacuate the most intense warzones, and that the ICW create taskforces to help rescue muggleborns and keep the Secret in such unstable areas.

**** Sounds intriguing - Zauberreich means magical place or something similar right?

***** I think it translates as Magical Realms/Empire but I'm not entirely certain of the connotations. I know that one of the plans to unite the Germanic nations historically was called the Gro8deutschreich (can't get the correct symbols from my phone, sorry) so I think I'm using the language correctly.

****** You can replace the weird double-S with "ss"; that's what we do in Switzerland.

Zauberreich basically means "magical realm" or "magical empire".

******* Oh good, I did use it correctly :) and thanks! I didn't know it could be replaced with 'ss', I thought that an 8 looked the closest to that beta-like symbol that I could get on a phone.

**** The biggest hurdle for a self-sustaining wizarding community is education. Homeschooling your kids won't be as effective as attending a school like Hogwarts - but to support such a school, you need more than a few families. I think Hogwarts might be an aberration, covering the same territory as the British Ministry of Magic, with other schools generally covering more than one country.

*** Ditto, it's an easier starting point then most.

The America's have been my biggest hurdle from here, what with JK's hamfisting attempt throwing me off and the overall complexity of the 17th-19th century period.

I did enjoy the small insight you provided into North America in The Dark Lord Never Died.

**** Since I kept Bulgaria as a wizarding country, I went with "the Ottomans lost the Balkan territories in both worlds". I think it's rather hard to control a wizarding population, due to their mobility and ability to hide, so a lot of nations will have formed anyway in the Magical World based on previous and sustained national identities.
