5th year, I think. The relative is a cousin from America, who was originally thought to be a squib. As a squib, he was sent to live with family in the US, and ends up serving in the military (possibly US Army?). He somehow unlocks his magic while in a firefight, using a Reducto curse to blow up an enemy MG nest. He finds Harry and starts teaching him wandless magic and martial arts, amongst other things, including Occulemency.

  This is a what if story. Canon will be followed when it fits my story. Harry is powerful but not a superhero, Harry and Hermione the main pairing, rating may change down the road.
