Long time readers of fanfiction who saw the start of cliché fanfiction tropes such as

Evil manipulative Dumbledore, WBWL (abusive, neglectful Potters) Bashings especially the Weasleys, misunderstood Voldemort who doesn't want to kill all Muggleborns and just wants to build an orphanage and schools for magical children etc.

Why did these become so common on FF.net?

What's the most overused Harry Potter fanfiction trope?

When did they first appear on fanfic websites or when did you first start noticing it being used and overused by multiple authors?

Honestly i don't know why this popped into my head at almost 2am but I'm really curious. I think those questions cover everything I want to know but if there's a question I missed feel free to still answer. Would love to hear your thoughts!


** I can't speak for everyone, but I joined the wagon for WBWL a long time ago. Roughly nine years I think?

Back then, there were a few dark harry stories- not nearly as popular as they are now. I think the appeal was that dark!harry stories were newly emerging then, and they were all written /well./ From what I've seen, when a trope starts to pick up popularity, it gets overblown and portrayed by people with limited experience. That wasn't necessarily the case then, because there were a few stories that were absolute giants and inspired a huge wave of WBWL stories. Thus, the authors that kept going with their WBWL stories inspired new stories, leading to the spread in popularity.

I wrote a (poorly done) WBWL fic in what I consider the "second wave" of dark-Harry stories, and the views and traffic results were outrageously high compared to how horrible it was. I wrote it in 2011, and then rewrote it recently (2018). I can confirm that the traffic results compared from then (each chapter release traffic) and now (the traffic of each chapter) is massively different.

On an unrelated note, I'm personal friends with a few 'famous' authors of dark-HP stories and I've discussed this with them as well. A lot of the hype and creativity of back then was also linked to the release dates of the Harry Potter books. The last book was released in 2007- so comparing that to the dates of some of the quality founding dark stories- the recent release of the book had insane potential for people writing. Having the complete canon information and being a pioneer to use it led to an explosion of a lot of darker stories as well. Once you have a complete set, it's much easier to look at everything as a whole and comprehend what areas you're going to modify or change entirely instead of hoping that the canon will work with you.

**** Sure! Keep in mind that the concept of quality has changed over the years. These stories were more of the major influences of the time- some predating the release of the last book or some of the founding stories of famous tropes today.

The most famous is likely: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2913149/1/The-Darkness-Within]]

It's being rewritten now, but it's entire series was super big. The rest of the stories jump around and tend to be the first stepping stones for famous tropes now.

Some of these stories are still being updated now, or ended fairly recently. That being said, they began a long time ago and drew attention from people and inspired them to create more content.

** The Draco Trilogy by Cassie Clair (or Clare? I can't remember which she used as a fic writer and which she used as a professional writer) was one of the earliest good!Draco stories and probably the most influential. It is also the origin of the term Draco in Leather Pants. It's no longer on ff.net (taken down because of plagiarism) but it's still out there somewhere, if you're curious.

Cassie Clair in general had a big impact on fandom history, not just the Harry Potter fandom. Look her up on fanlore if you want to read about how internet fandom has always been nuts.

** Most tropes are born of canon. Be it something that actually happened or a comprehension issue. Some were born out of an attempt to make some sense out of a plot hole, but instead of improving it, they made it worse lol.

For example: evil, manipulative Dumbledore. Left Harry in an abusive home so that he could raise a pig for slaughter because he one hundred percent believed in the prophecy.

Only one part of this is canon. Dumbledore repeatedly tells us he thinks little of divination. He didn't take it in school and would have put an end to the course had she not made the prophecy. We are also shown and told that living with the Dursleys is the only reason Harry lived to see the end.

Weasley bashing: chest monster (because there's absolutely not a line that says Harry enjoyed her company for most of the summer). Molly's attitude towards Sirius, Fleur, Hermione in GoF, and her disregarding Fred and George's dream. Oh, and the love potion. And people really just dislike Ron.

Misunderstood Voldemort/Draco/Bella: many people enjoy a 'good' enemies to lovers story. Snape can be included in this, but there's also the Prince's Tale, a chapter used to excuse his actions. I'm of the belief that wasn't the intention of said chapter, but whatever.

***** Those are two separate issues

Voldemort not being able to touch Harry is due to Lily's sacrifice. That was solved by using Harry's blood to revive himself. Nothing to do with the wards.

And you said that staying at Privet Drive was the *only* reason Harry lived to see the end. There is no evidence, outside of Dumbledore's supposition, that Harry would have died had he been in another protected location. Every single summer he spent time away from Privet Drive. Hell, even after the flight from Privet Drive, he spent a year travelling around and avoided trouble for the most part. Was it perhaps the single most safest place from Voldemort and his followers? Maybe. But there were clearly plenty of other safe places, from the Burrow, Grimmauld Place, the Leaky Cauldron, etc.

Dumbledore is JKR's mouthpiece.

Harry living at Privet Drive kept the protections alive causing Voldemort to take his blood. Dumbledore, aka JKR, tells us in DH that Voldemort taking the blood tethered Harry to life. So, yes, living at Privet Drive is the only reason he survived the second Killing Curse. And Harry only must return to Privet Drive every summer, which he does. I don't know where you got it that he needed to stay there the entire summer.

The protections, as stated in HBP, ended upon his 17th. Voldemort could not entire 4 Privet Drive because Harry was still 17. He could not touch Harry at 4 Privet Drive until Harry was a 17, which is why they moved him before he turned 17.

Edit:

Dumbledore in HBP:

#+begin_quote
  "The magic I evoked fifteen years ago means that Harry has powerful protection while he can still call this house 'home. ' However miserable he has been here, however unwelcome, however badly treated, you have at least, grudgingly, allowed him houseroom. This magic will cease to operate the moment that Harry turns seventeen; in other words, at the moment he becomes a man. I ask only this: that you allow Harry to return, once more, to this house, before his seventeenth birthday, which will ensure that the protection continues until that time."
#+end_quote

Dumbledore in DH:

#+begin_quote
  “He took your blood believing it would strengthen him. He took into his body a tiny part of the enchantment your mother laid upon you when she died for you. His body keeps her sacrifice alive, and while that enchantment survives, so do you and so does Voldemort's one last hope for himself.”

** I can't really tell you where they began, since I started reading HPFF a bit over two years ago. But I can tell you why I think these tropes became so popular:

*1) evil manipulative Dumbledore* -- take his actions in the books, which, depending on how you view it, can be questionable, and you can kinda end up with a manipulative old person. It provides for an easy Indy!Harry starting point, since he has someone who has been "controlling" Harry and denying him power. It can also act as another conflict, but it is rarely done well.

*2) WBWL* -- kinda easy to justify, since we don't have that much characterisation to James and Lily. Just like evil Dumbledore, I don't like most of stories with this premise because they simply don't make it believable, making it a bit too extreme. But they do provide a starting point for sibling conflict, neglected-yet-still-raised-magical scenarios, etc.

*3) Bashing* -- if you want to make a story with different characters, or you're too lazy to write some dynamics, then you just use bashing. This is a very cheap way to get rid of a character. The most common ones you see are the Weasleys, because they're such an integral part of the Harry-Ron-Hermione dynamic. Hermione can also get bashed if you want no Golden Trio, etc.

*4) Misunderstood Voldemort* -- I really don't know lol. Probably if you want a redemption arc without creating any believable circumstances?

It all comes down to is lazy writing. I have seen evil Dumbledore, WBWL and (to an extent) bashing done in such a way that it didn't feel like lazy writing, and the stories were great. But most writers use it as a working tool to set up circumstances for their stories.

The reason why clichés exist is that they are proven and effective tools the writers can use to communicate a certain idea or spin the plot. The two dangers of using clichés are:

1) it's easier to set up the premise, therefore easier to get by with bad writing, decreasing the quality of works with these premises

2) it's hard to be original -- someone did these tropes and did them right, but if you just repeat what has been done a thousand times, the value of your story rapidly approaches zero.

I've yet to see a good misunderstood Voldemort, but I can see a justification for the trope. In canon, Voldemort is generically evil, which is often pretty boring. By instead making him the hero of his own story, even if he's still doing bad stuff. For example, take the following facts:

Death eaters are anti muggle.

Voldemort is in control of the death eaters.

Death eaters are opposed to the Ministry and Dumbledore.

How do we make those facts more nuanced?

Voldemort has some other primary objective at odds with the Ministry. Perhaps he wants to break the statute of secrecy so wizards can live openly. Perhaps in the nuclear age, he feels that the nonmagical world must be kept in check lest they destroy the planet. Perhaps there's some other, third party threat at play.

His association with the Death Eaters can then be a marriage of convenience. They are a marginalized group that's easily manipulated towards his ends. Allowing Death Eater members to harass and attack muggles is not an aim, but simple collateral damage from accomplishing his true aims.

I think when most of us hear "hyena" we think if Lion King where the hyenas are constantly joking and goofing around and laughing loudly. I think it fits because it's also that the twins can be deadly in a fight just like hyenas. They're certainly not prey.

I cant say much about the coyote trope because i dont know enough about coyotes except that they make a loud crying howl which doesnt fit the twins in my opinion.

** Fanfic tropes? Well a lot of them are born in the fandom because it'd shown to have a possibility of happening or something closely related to it has happened within the Universe of the story. And now you can have fun reading my reasonings for some of the tropes I find really often throughout all the fanfiction I've read (I've read too much... probably)

*Arranged marriage?* Purebloods had many of them so it can therefore happen again.

*Creature inheritance?* We have full-Veelas, Half-Veelas and Quarter-Veelas, apparently vampires (see first book that mentions it), Werewolves, etc. So who knows what kind of other creatures that can mate with humans. Who says I can't be half Unicorn???? Or a weird person-bird mix like a half-harpie or something?

*Time travel*? Time travel is already possible in the story, who is to say something bad hasn't happen while trying to make or create a time-turner and someone got accidentally sent back further in time?

*Dumbledore bashing*? When you look at the things he did throughout the series for the 'greater good', his reasonings don't make too much sense. Like, let's keep James, Lily, Neville's parents and their children in the country with the knowledge of a prophecy about killing their children!!! GREAT IDEA DUMBLEDORE!

*Weasley bashing?* Listen, Ron is an extremely jealous arse who get's by because he has these few sarcastic comments and got the girl in the end, Ginny hexes anyone who talks back to her and she's kinda violent, Molly is questionable sometimes with how she treats anyone who disagrees with her, Percy abandoned his family (but great that he came back though!) I see why people wouldn't like them too much. (I'm not even going to go into detail with the twins XD)

*Misunderstood Voldemort?* I think that when Voldemort was spreading his idea of blood supremacy, some may have taken it too far (Extremists) and that's how he became known, and authors use that to their advantage to give him more about his personality.

*Dark Harry?* Who knows what Harry would have been like if Dumbledore or Hagrid or McGonagall hadn't been such strong influences on him. Also, I kinda like this one because of the possibilities as an alternative.

*Soul bond?* Some spells are pretty fucking weird, like the unbreakable vow that binds two people into a magical contract, or the Goblet of fire with the magical contract for who ever's name comes out. Who is to say Bond magic isn't so much deeper than that?

And Andromeda got kicked out of the family for not wanting to have a 'proper pureblood marriage'.

It can be assumed that the families within the sacred 28 would arrange with other families within the same circles for unions. Therefore being an 'arranged marriage' not necessarily a We-just-met-at-our-wedding thing.

And with the Voldemort thing, I don't believe he had any good, but I can assure you he wasn't just killing muggles without having any followers. He probably made a lot of promises to certain people but never came back on them.

ex: 'I promise I'll get you power' can be a pretty tempting offer if it's said in the right way.
