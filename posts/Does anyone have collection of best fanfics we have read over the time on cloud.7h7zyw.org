** You willing to take this wrong boy who lived fic where Harry's a vampire prince building a veela vampire harem (Gabby and Fleur, duh) camping out at Hogwarts because something about Dumbledore aand evil twin but nobody knows its his twin and he's got a different color phoenix that is super cool and way bette than a normal one and he and Fleer and the vampire princesss bang alot but he wont ban gabby cus shes to young and shs still his waif and is cute but the poin t is and the vampir are so powrful that voldemor doesn;t stand a chance but voldemort is still a live because harry hasn't killed him but that's why hes lord slythin because writ of contest which still applicable even thouh Vodemort isn't dead and really what kind of a legal system has a rit of concquest. it doesn't make any sense. And harry;s dlark but no evil and he no sparkle and can go in sun! It's not completel but im sure the author will get back from their hiatus someday.
