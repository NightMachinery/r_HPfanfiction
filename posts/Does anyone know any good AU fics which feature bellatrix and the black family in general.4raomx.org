Preferably those that aren't Bellatrix/Voldemort and where she at least kind of has a relationship with her husband, or fics where she doesn't go to Azkaban b/c the potters weren't killed i.e.


** *Delenda Est*, linkffn(5511855), is one of my favorites. That Bellatrix is actually credible, unlike many white-washing fics. The story is divided into two distinctive parts, and some people don't like the second one. I can only say that the first part feels more serious and the second part is more humorous.

  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.
