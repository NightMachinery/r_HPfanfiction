Trousers and pants, for example.


** *British word | American word*.

- Aeroplane | Airplane.
- Anticlockwise | Counterclockwise.
- Arse | Ass (an ass is just a donkey)
- Asda. | Wal-Mart.
- Aubergine | eggplant.
- Autumn | Fall
- Bin | Wastepaper basket.
- Biscuit | Cookie (A cookie refers to a specific KIND of biscuit, usually a chocolate-chip cookie or an American-style sugar cookie. That bizarre thing Americans serve with what they call "gravy" and label "biscuit" is unknown to us.)
- Blazer | suit jacket.
- Block | Building (So a "block" of flats, as opposed to an apartment building. We also don't split cities or towns into "blocks", so no one would say "to the next block" or something similar.)
- Bobble. | Hair tie.
- Bobble hat | beanie.
- Bollocks | Balls.
- Braces. | Suspenders.
- Briefs/knickers | panties.
- Bum | butt. (You'd have the "butt" of a cigarette, but generally children would call it their bum, not their butt.)
- Candy floss | cotton candy.
- Car boot & bonnet | Car trunk & hood.
- Car park | Parking lot.

- Copper | cop.
- Cot | Crib.
- Courgette | Zucchini.
- Crisps | Chips.
- Cupboard | Closet. (Also, no-one has a "closet" in their room, because our houses aren't stupidly big like American houses. People will likely have a wardrobe in which to hang clothes.)
- Doughnut | If someone's a doughnut, they're an idiot.
- Doughnut | Donut.
- Draw | tie. (of a game)
- Drawing pin/push pin | Thumb tack.
- Drink. | Liquor. (Liquor wouldn't be a catch-all term here, but would refer specifically to actual liquors, like Bailey's or Cointreau. Also, not "lickor", but liq-YER.)
- Driver's license | driving license.
- Dummy | pacifier.
- Fag | Ciggy. (as in Cigarette).
- Fizzy drink. | Soda.
- Flannel | wash cloth.
- Flat | Apartment. (Someone might have an apartment, but that would be quite an upper class thing 'cause it would be a lot nicer and bigger than a flat, and usually wouldn't be in a tall tower block.)
- Football | soccer.
- Football pitch | Soccer field.
- Four-by-four | four-wheeled-drive.

- Marks. | Grades. (For example, one would usually say "keeping your marks up" rather than "grades up". We'd normally get graded on individual projects, and grades would come at the end of the year. The GPA isn't a thing.)
- Maths. | Math.
- Merry-go-round | Carousel. (fairground)
- Minge | pussy.
- Minging | gross. (Rhymes with singing. Generally regional and/or lower class.)

- Nought | Zero.
- Noughts & Crosses | Tic-Tac-Toe.
- Off-license. | Liquor store.
- Pad/sanitary towel | Sanitary napkin.

- Shagging | banging.
- Skirting board | baseboard.
- Snogging | making out.

- Suspenders. | Garter belt.
- Swede | rutabega.
- Sweets | candy.
- Swimming costume | swimsuit.

- To slag off | to bitch about.
- Toffee apple | candy apple.
- Tomato Sauce | Ketchup.

- Wee | little. (Regional. You'll mostly hear this from Scots, but it's relevant given where Hogwarts is.)
- Wee | Pee.
- You lot | Y'all.
- Zed | Zee.

So that's just some of the examples I can come up with off the top of my head. If you pay attention just listening to the differences in the way British people talk, you can easily pick up the difference in phraseology compared to Americans, and vice versa. There are a few Brit-specific idioms, too - like, an old-fashioned way to say you're going to the loo is to say you're "off to spend a penny", and stuff like that.

"Dudes" isn't really a thing. We've not really a direct equivalent, but you could get a group of lads together. Lad culture is a whole thing in itself, and you'd really have to pay attention to a comedy like Bad Education to sort of /get it/, like.

There's also a lot of regional slang you could expect depending on who you were chatting to, and there's a very rich difference in the way people might speak based on where in the UK they're coming from, so even if someone's accent is relatively neutral you can often tell if their family's like, Northern or something based on the slang they use.

For example, there's a big argument across the UK and Ireland as to whether it's "bap", "roll", "bun", "batch", "cop", "barm" etc, depending on where you're from, like.

"Hoover" is more common than vacuum cleaner, and as for jail, it's actually relatively recent in the UK vernacular, like. We do tend towards calling it prison.

I'm Welsh, living in Ireland. I do know this shit, mate - it's an easy list to help Americans lol. Vocabulary is fluid, and the British and American differences have become a lot less defined in recent years, with us adopting more of their words and vice versa.

*** What's with the biscuits, every english person I know goes nuts about that.

Americans say swimming trunks. Same with roundabout, pavement, roundabout, and merry go round.

We like saying bendy straws because we have straws that don't bend.

I suppose AC's are more common in the US since the weather is far warmer. College is a small school with only one college.

A large school that are a collection of colleges is a university.

A jail is for a short term unsentenced stay. Once charged guilty and sentenced, they go to prison.

I think the GPA is pretty cool. It shows the need for a body of work rather than value just a few exams.

Our houses are big because we actually have more land to build into. We also have larger yards (front and back).

American English came from a desire to be different, as well as the influence from the mish mash of cultures we have here.

** The use of terms such as "upperclassmen", "Lowerclassmen", Freshmen, Sophomore, seniors, juniors is really American and annoying as fuck to a British reader. Usually in Britain you refer to year groups i.e. first year second years etc, or with larger groupings; elder and younger are used. It depends on where you come from. The closest to freshmen you'll find is "Freshers" and that's really only used for students who are starting university.

** Mom/mum Although I've heard that there's one tiny part of Britain where people do actually say mom instead of mum.

Closet/cupboard I like Avengers x HP crossovers. Not a single avenger, except maybe Thor, would say that Harry grew up in a cupboard, yet in every fic where one of the Avengers is related to Harry, they all call it a cupboard without first hearing Harry call it that. This also confused me as a middle schooler reading the stories for the first time, because to me a cupboard was like a kitchen cabinet, yet he was able to fit a mattress or camp bed in there (can't remember which one exactly canon stated he had).

You all/you lot Or y'all if you're from the southern US.

Inserting the word like before everything is a very American thing that only came about in the 90's. As HP takes place in the 90's, none of the characters would be saying it in every other sentence.

But what really annoys me is “was + simple past tense”. That is grammatically incorrect. It's only part of a local British dialect in one part of GB. If you or your characters aren't from there (or somewhere else I don't know if where that's part of the local dialect), it's wrong. It seems like there are a few authors who are actually from that part of Britain, so naturally speak that way. Because their fics became popular, a bunch of clearly American authors started writing like them. It's rather painful to me to see a fic loaded with Americanisms, but have all the characters say things like, “he was sat in class”.

Also, the way I put my periods outside my quotes is British. They only go inside the quotes when the punctuation is part of the quote. Not so in American English, which always puts the punctuation inside the quote. But I'm a contrary American when it comes to this but of grammar because the British way makes more sense than the American.

The best one though, as amusing as pants/trousers can be, is fanny. In America if someone says that they're probably talking about someone's butt or a fanny pack, an ugly zippered bag that goes around one's waist. In England, it means vagina.

Oh halle-fuckin'-lujah.

So I don't actually read a lot of books by British authors (and, unless they're set in modern Britain, I often look for the American publication anyway because I am a traitor to my country and hate single quotations for speech) so I'd noticed the punctuation inside quotations and assumed it was standard across all, and I really dislike it.

*** "Cupboard under the stairs" had enough context for me to figure out. I would sit and read in ours all the time as a kid, really cosy. Lots of bugs though.

**** That makes sense. I didn't have anything like that in my house. It was one story, so I didn't have much context for anything being under stairs. The kitchen did have a ton of cabinets, many of which were large and at floor level, so that's what I based my visualization on of what he lived in.

** Seeing 'semester' instead of 'term' in fanfics always makes me groan a little. And back in the day I recall a number of writers having characters put cream in their tea instead of milk, which just isn't the usuall thing in England.
