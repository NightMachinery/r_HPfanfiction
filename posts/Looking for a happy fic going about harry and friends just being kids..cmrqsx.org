Hey all, I am looking for a fanfic that focusses on Harry and his friends just enjoying day to day life in the hogwarts era (some shippings are fine as well ;)). Both alternate universe stories without war or stories following canon events are fine. Looking forward to your sugestions.

  2. Once, over the course of two memorable weeks, an escaped Chizpurfle wreaked havoc inside the castle. “A what?” Ron whispered, when it was announced at dinner.“A Chizpurfle,” Hermione hissed back. “Newt Scamander wrote about them in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. They're small crab-like parasites that feed off larger creatures like Augureys and Crups, but they're also attracted to leftover potions and objects with high magical concentrations.” “My mam told me about them,” Seamus Finnigan said darkly. “She said once when I was little, we had a Chizpurfle infestation in our house. Turns out they were after her wand and some of the rare spellbooks she kept in the attic.”“They eat wands?” Harry asked, horrified.“Yeah. Mam told the neighbors it was rats. Had to live with my uncle Angus for three weeks, while the Ministry pest control cleaned ‘em all out.”
