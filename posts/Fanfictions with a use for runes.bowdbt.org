I really like the concept of runes for enchanting things. So are there stories where they play a bigger role. I don't want fics where runes are the answer for everything, so please no Rune Stone Path and I also no Runemaster.

  If you read just one fiction tonight make it this one. Go inside the mind of Harry Potter as he deals with betrayals, secrets and wild adventures. Not your usual fanfic.

** Runes play a big role in /Wizard of the Kaleidoscope/ linkffn(6995114) and the way they work is very fleshed out, although they don't come in play in the first few chapters (around the 10th, iirc).

Be warned however that the fic is a crossover (Mostly HP, with a bit of Naruto and a liberal use of Nasuverse concepts and characters) so that might be what you're looking for. The different magical systems and concepts are well meshed together and I liked the story a lot for this, but that may be due to my being ridiculously fan of the Nasuverse.

  What does it take to destroy something completely? Some would be fine with eradicating its soul. Others would argue that you must erase even the concept of the object from existence. AU, with a notoriously complex Magic system.

*** Damn, and I thought I had read most of the HP x Nasuverse crossover, I should have looked for the unmarked ones!

Thanks for the rec!

Does the title means that Harry becomes Zelretch ? Or that Zelretch is involved in it (stupid question, of course he is)

#+end_quote

Kind of a stupid question, indeed! On a more serious note and without spoling too much, no, Harry does not become Zelretch, and the man himself appears around the middle of the story, when the nasuverse crossover kicks into full gear.

On a different note, do you happen to have a list of the HP x Nasuverse crossovers that you have enjoyed? I'm now craving for more, but I lack the will to crawl through the whole section to find some good ones.

  Ladies of Eternity, magi of the past hiding in the present. Those words describe Witches in the Moonlit world, with their daughters inheriting their role without exceptions. But this is a story of a Witch's son -- a boy tossed aside by cruel fate. A boy who dreamed of becoming a magus, but failed. A boy, who carves his path through blood and wand. A Boy, a Potter, and a Thief.

  Caster never reached the Temple. As she lay dying, in another time and another place, a small boy collapses as a circle activates that shouldn't exist.

It certainly can't be worse.

** Czech group of fanfiction writers (in Czech language, of course) centered around [[http://budec.net/]] developed theory, that something similar to runes (more graphical than text) is an Old Slavic Magic. It is based on the fact that the Czech word „čáry“ means in the same time sorcery and lines (like what you produce while drawing). What probably even authors around this server don't know, is that there actually was an ancient Slavonic system (pre-Christian, so a way before Glagolitic and even longer before Cyrillic alphabet) of something (it has never been deciphered) called [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-Christian_Slavic_writing][чръты и рѣзы]] (strokes and incisions), which could very well be foundation of such magic.
