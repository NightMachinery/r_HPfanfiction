Throw me your *best* Tom Riddle/Voldemort and Harry Potter fanfics. Im open to either slash or any other form of relationship.

Not sure if this has been asked before!

Just finished one ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13851720/chapters/31860741]]) and it brought back the HP feels, and the fandom which I long abandoned, thinking I exhausted most of the quality fics


** I wrote most of this post two years ago, but I'll repost it here because it's very topical. I've added a few items, and randomly trimmed down the list so that it doesn't go over the bot's 30 fic limit, but for the most part, if I've mentioned their username, you should check their profile, because they've definitely written more hp/tmr or hp/lv or hp&tmr; there's just no space for it here. Since I've trimmed the number of recs to at most 1-2 random ones (from the list I had before) per writer, if you don't like the fic linked, I'd still encourage you to take a look at their profile for more.

These are in no particular order, although most of the ones actually linked are longer/plot-based stories, mostly because I also know a lot of one shots but don't want to go through absolutely everything. If you're looking more for drabbles/fluff and coffee shops/one-shots/whatever, let me know.

Edit: also, it's not on the list because the list was mostly for actual ship fics, but Prince of the Dark Kingdom is a great mentorship fic, although very well-known so you may have read it already.

  In which Tom Riddle devises a diabolical plot to usurp the main soul piece, Lord Voldemort, and the Boy-Who-Lived mysteriously vanishes on his eleventh birthday. Or, where Tom hates everything but tolerates his fellow horcruxes plus his arch-nemesis in order to take over the world... if things would only go his way.A drabble series told in snippets of 100, because nothing else properly conveys the absurdity of this situation.This work now has a guide with extra information and explanations. Check the last chapter to read it!

#+begin_quote
  In a world where Voldemort's victory brought forth the golden age of pureblood supremacy, young Harry - an average Durmstrang student - grows surrounded by the same propaganda that has become the gospel truth of the Wizarding World. Injustice is a norm and racism is not only accepted, but actively encouraged. Embracing the status quo becomes harder when Harry finds himself in a train station where the living should not dwell, and a dangerous friend who goes by the name "Tom".

#+begin_quote
  Unsatisfied with his post-war life, Harry decides to get to the root of all of his problems when that root was still working at Borgin and Burkes shop in the late 40s. He's the Master of Death, damn it, he can do what he wants for once in his life.Tom Riddle isn't particularly happy about working at a small, dingy shop for magical artifacts, no matter how interesting those artifacts are. He's even less happy when an insufferable stranger sets up the most obnoxious flower shop right across the street.What follows would be a romantic comedy, if it weren't for politics.

  The smallest change in details can lead to vastly different outcomes. When Harry finds Tom Riddle's diary in his second year, he befriends the entity that resides within. This simple act results in a ripple effect that tears the story as we know it apart, causing a descent into the madness that is the human psyche. Polish translation

  COMPLETE LV/HP: Raised in a Muggle orphanage, Harry arrives at Hogwarts a bitter boy. Unusually intelligent, he's recruited by the Unspeakables and the Death Eaters at a young age. As he grows older, he constantly has to struggle to keep his footing around a manipulative and bored Dark Lord, who fancies mind games and intellectual entertainment.

  Harry Potter, weathered wizarding warrior in his mid-twenties, finds himself in 1940. Albus is coming up with a theory, and an adolescent Tom Riddle, torn between feeling threatened and piqued, acquires a controversial mentor. Hallows, spell-making, horror, politics and witty banter, served with a Grindledore sidedish. Slow and slightly disturbing TR/HP. First chapters re-polished.

  Harry Potter wakes in 1943, with golden scars littering his skin, and a headache. Who knew what time turner explosions could do? He decides to stay undercover until he can figure out a way to get out of this whole mess. Unfortunately, Harry was never very good at following plans. Tom Riddle didn't anticipate an interesting new arrival... but he can work with this. TMR/HP
