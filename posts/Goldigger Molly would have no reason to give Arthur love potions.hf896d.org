In many stories that bash molly, she is a gold-digger who is giving Arthur love potions to control him. My question is ...why? If molly Weasley was truly evil and just wanted money to support her lifestyle why choose a poor dude with a bad job who lives in a shack/hovel? What advantages does Arthur bring her? If she was sooo good at love potions and manipulating people she chooses the worse target.


** I read a few that had Molly get pregnant with Bill by one of Arthur's brothers (who of course was married already) and she potioned Arthur into marrying him so she wouldn't be 'shamed' for having a kid 'out of wedlock'...

Lots of Christian undertones in those fics

** In many of those fics, Weasley's are quite wealthy at Arthur's youth, before his father gets swindled by Lucius' father. I've also seen some where Molly was potioning someone else - like Barty Sr. - and her parents married her off to Arthur Weasley when it came out.

*** There are also many where Arthur's father was, um, similarly prodigious (?) at having kids as he is and Arthur is a younger son. While the family may have had money, he didn't as it was mostly inherited through primogeniture so he had some "getting started" money and maybe the land under the Burrow or something similar.

**** I don't know where you get your info on most teenagers having daddy issues, but likely the reason we see more Molly bashing than Arthur bashing is that Molly had a more rounded character- she argued with other characters and wasn't a mary sue. She also had more lines and a bigger place in the story. Arthur was less confrontational, often away at work, and was mostly mentioned second hand rather than having his own scenes. Also there's probably sexism mixed in there from some authors- sometimes authors don't even realise they're holding every flaw against female characters while not looking that closely at the men.

***** Apparently one of the biggest contributions (I was pretty against Molly Weasley from canon, so I asked why people liked her and got some really interesting answers) is her whole "They're just children, don't tell them anything!" approach. Expecting Harry not to get into trouble after two years of shit was pretty self-delusional, but after that thread I stopped blaming her for it.

Also, the whole 'my husband does what he loves, I do what I love, Percy does what he loves, Bill does what he loves, Charlie does what he loves, but the Twins absolutely cannot under any circumstances open their shop that they've apparently been saving and building for' thing. That seems somewhat of a disjoint for most, but I can see the other side of the argument as well.

So, yeah. Rereading your message, you're pretty much right. Arthur was very non-confrontational, whereas she was interfering with everything in sight at every opportunity. I know I'd react real badly to that kind of parenting, even if I knew it came from a place of affection and care.

*** Doesn't really matter for these stories.

99% of Molly-bashing authors see enough justification to make Molly a potion-happy gold-digger based on her story about making a love-potion in her youth (which is treated as a ha-ha-I-was-dumb-as-a-kid moment in universe), confusing the names of her near-identical twin sons when they're deliberately trying to confuse her, and her talking about Platform 9¾ in front of muggles.

"If you give me six lines written by the hand of the most honest of men, I will find something in them which will hang him." That quote applies to character-bashing as much as anything - anything a character does wrong, or is /thought/ to do wrong, will be mercilessly exploited by people looking to add more cheap conflict to a fic.

**** Most of the Molly bashing I have seen rarely mentions gold digging (at least as it relates to Arthur) and is almost solely revolving around her being wildly overbearing and meddlesome and controlling. Which, to a point, she is. Maybe not as bad as the bashing fics make out, but to some degree, those are accurate descriptions if her character, regardless of whether it is "out of love" or not.

Most of these fics usually manifest in her doing everything to push a Harry/Ginny marriage (I dislike Hinny as a couple).

*** Yeah, she jokes about using love potions, which at the time most people were like "that sounds a bit off-color for Molly, but alright," and then we're told Riddle's backstory, that love potions are basically all date rape drugs combined, and that those born from such a horrifically broken facsimile of "love" are themselves incapable of love and empathy.

Now, seeing that all the Weasley kids are well adjusted, it's rather obvious that if she ever potioned Arthur, she stopped before any of their kids were born.

For me, this lets ne enjoy a story where Molly either potions Harry/ Hermione, or encourages Ginny/Ron to do so because of the sheer "what if?" factor. I don't recall any point where she was shown to be a gold digger, however.

***** I'd agree, but I've never been able to get behind Hinny in the first place. Even though there's much less shiptease between Harry and Hermione than the movies, there's still a much greater basis for a relationship there than Harry and Ginny have. I'd argue that Luna has had more interaction with Harry than Ginny.

Of course, there have been fics where Ginny/Harry is splendidly done, but the canon reasons just don't really add up for ne, since there's very little chemistry.

Which, again, is why a bit of potioneering is such an easy target to hit for any and all Weasley bashers.

****** While I do have to admit that Hinny doesn't have the canon development it probably should have, I disagree with your statement about Harmony. While there is definitely affection there, Harry is shown repeatedly ignoring and not putting value into Hermione's ideas. Their friendship is very flawed and I don't feel that a romantic relationship would be sustainable for very long.

******* Wow, have to disagree, and I am not even a harmony shipper. Canon H/HR is the most well built relationship in the series. There are very few examples of Harry not valuing HR; setting the romantic undertone completely aside, that you would say their friendship is flawed makes me wonder what books you were reading.

How about this instead: is there any relationship (romantic or platonic) in canon that comes near the devotion and loyalty H/HR show each other?

******* No no, I agree. I was simply saying there's more /shiptease/ between Harry and Hermione than Harry and Ginny. Going from Hermione, there's loads of tease between her and Ron. Looking at only the small selection of guys available to Second-Best Girl, Hermione's ship rankings would be:

☆1 Ron 2 Harry 2.5 Krum 3 Neville ... 47 Lockhart ... 7,000,999,998 Draco 7,000,999,999 Voldy

Just like with Hinny, Harmony doesn't have much chemistry. It'd just be an easier pill to swallow because at least there was a foundation, even if it was pockmarked.

**** For Riddle, the love potion used was the strongest love potion in existence, it seems there's a large range of them, hence why the twins were selling them in their store, low level love potions might be used in the wizarding world as a form of social lubrication, I've seen one example in stories of someone using a love potion on themself to give them the confidence to speak to their crush.

******** Same difference. She had to go back /because/ she was asked about it. That's how Q&As work.

And there was enough to make a big enough implication that it became readily accepted as canon before she was asked and said "that's not the case."

The biggest "clue" that I recall accepting as proof positive was Dumbledore's insistence that Tom jr didn't understand love. The way it was put sounded less "he's emotionally stunted" and more "he's a born sociopath." Perhaps myself and a million other readers misunderstood that, but sadly that is something artists and authors deal with all the time: fans who think they get what's going on when there's nothing going on.

********** .......Yes. I understand that. That's what I've been saying and agreeing with. Sorry, I'm probably just not making myself clear enough.

Back when that whole love potion thing first came out, the was a lot of debate, before it was generally agreed that Voldemort /must/ be emotionally crippled because of his father being potioned to the gills.

The entire reason that old conversation was brought up was because it's what really got Weasley Bashers to not only bash Ron, but Molly as well, for being "as evil as Tommy's mommy."

Of course, then Rowling cleared up the nonsense, but by then the "evil Molly" stick was firmly in hand of all Weasley haters, ready to be used against the dead horse known as "bashing."

I never said retcon, only that she cleared up the misconception. Now I'd very much appreciate it if you stopped attempting to argue with me when I'm agreeing with you.

Let me reiterate: we're on the same side of this debate. This information was brought up not as some form of "fact" but as the reasoning behind a couple of the fandom's dumber headcanons, the Evil Molly one in particular.

** I've read a bunch of Weasley bashing and only read one where Molly was like this. It was something about her liking control but also she liked being able to stay at home as well and if Arthur left her then she'd have to find a job or husband and that was too much effort. Also she had a reputation and she wasn't going to let him divorce her cuz it would look bad. I think she genuinely liked him and wasn't in it for the money but I can't remember too well. She also schooled Ginny in the same thing with love potions and fertility potions so Ginny could use them on Harry but thankfully that didn't work out of course and Molly was caught. I think Ginny ended up in St Mungo's but I'm not one hundred percent sure. It was a great read and I totally didn't expect it. Haven't read a book like it since.
