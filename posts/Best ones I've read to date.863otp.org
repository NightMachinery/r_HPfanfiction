** How about rather than just posting random fic titles we get some information on why you like them and why anyone else should read them?

I'm assuming you mean linkffn(11610805) and linkffn(7038840)

  The day before Harry Potter was due to go to Hogwarts for the very first time, his aunt and uncle informed him that he wouldn't be going. Instead, he was sent to Stonewall High. Now, three years later, the Goblet of Fire has named him as a TriWizard Champion. What that means is anyone's guess, but to Harry, one thing is clear: he can finally get away from Privet Drive.
