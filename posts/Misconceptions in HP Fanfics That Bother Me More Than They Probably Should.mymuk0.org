Yeah, so basically like the title implies, I'll be listing all of my most hated misconceptions I've seen in Harry Potter fanfics. Note that these aren't listed in any particular order.

1. *James and Sirius were idiots who needed to cheat off of Remus to pass their classes.*

I've already mentioned this in another post so I won't go into too much detail, but I'm just going to say that this is incorrect. The books mention several times that James and Sirius were the top students during their time, and this is backed up by the fact that they were able to become Animagi at 15 and were clever enough to invent the wizarding version of Skype (two-way mirrors). Remus was probably more studious than them, but that's because James and Sirius didn't /need/ to study the material. There's a difference between being naturally intelligent and lazy and being complete morons.

*2. James asked Lily out every single day for six/seven years.*

Not only is this awful because it basically romanticizes harassment, it's also just plain untrue. We see James ask Lily out exactly ONE time during the series. As far as we know, that is the only time he asks her out. Yes, they eventually started dating, but it's entirely possible that Lily was the one who asked him.

In addition, all the evidence we get points to him NOT asking her out before fifth year at the earliest. When they first meet on the train, James is visibly disinterested in Lily, and later, when Lily and Snape are arguing about Avery and Mulciber sometime early in their fifth year, he explicitly tells her that James fancies her, implying that he thought Lily wasn't aware of it. That's not exactly something you would say to someone who's been asked out by an individual several hundred times before.

*3. Snape was only mean to his students because he had to keep his cover.*

Really? Because I seem to remember that Quirrell and Crouch both had to keep their cover, and they never mistreated Harry or any of their students (well, except for when Crouch/Moody turned Malfoy into a ferret and bounced him around the corridor). And nobody ever suspected anything about them.

*4. Harry and Ron were stupid.*

Considering Hermione was the top student of their year, alright, I can see why this misconception is so popular. But as much as I love Hermione, I feel it's important to mention that she was notorious for being obsessed with studying while Harry and Ron definitely weren't--and they still managed to get excellent grades regardless. If Harry and Ron had put half as much effort into their studying as she did, it's entirely possible they would have topped her. Plus, speaking purely for Ron here, I'm pretty sure someone who's as dumb as a brick wouldn't be as good at chess as he was.

*5. Regulus Black was an innocent bean.*

Let me preface this by saying that I love Regulus Black. He's one of my favorite characters, and although we barely see him in the books, the small bits we do get to see paint him out to be an interesting and complex character.

But...no, just no.

Regulus wasn't an innocent bean who was forced to join the Death Eaters. He wholeheartedly believed in his parents' anti-Muggle/Muggleborn ideology, and he was a hardcore Voldemort fanatic (you can correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe the books mention him having newspaper clippings about Voldemort hung up around his room). For most of his life, he held terrible, bigoted beliefs.

/But he changed./

He realized that he didn't want to support Voldemort anymore and died trying to take him down. We don't know for sure if he would have changed his beliefs since he was killed before he had the chance to really grow up, but he turned against Voldemort and that's a step in the right direction. But what we do know is that in the end, he died for the right cause after spending most of his life supporting the wrong one.

That's what makes him such a fascinating character. And making him out to be some pure, innocent bean, at least in my opinion, takes away from one of the best character arcs in the series.

So his mind wasn't 'strong' enough to really hurt Bellatrix with that curse at that moment. If it's not that, then I feel that Harry wasn't trained or powerful enough for such a curse in Order of the Phoenix.

My head canon says that by the time that the Battle of Hogwarts was on the horizon that Harry was trained enough. Whether it's because he learned while hunting Horcruxes or he was trained to know how to cast these curses behind the scenes in school.

It's been awhile since I read Deathly Hallows, but that's my head canon.

Fleur was a Veela, Tonks was the halfblood daughter of a muggleborn and someone who was actively thrown out of one of the top Death Eater dynasties for committing a blood purity taboo, Remus was a werewolf and if Umbridge and Snape were any indication Voldemort was probably planning to pull a night of the long knives against Greyback's crew, Figg was a squib, Hagrid and Maxine were half giants, Aberforth was a Dumbledore which would probably get his blood status held against him more strictly in the same manner as Tonks's connection to the Blacks, etc.

** Amelia Bones being this superstar head of the DMLE that can solve all the world's problems. It's undeniable that Amelia was a competent witch as it's believed Voldemort himself killed her and she is referred to as 'fair'. However it's either ill-will on her side or she doesn't have as much power or flair, since she allows several abuses to go on of which her department should have been in charge: Hagrid's initial arrest and the subsequent attempt at arresting him in OotP, Dementors at Hogwarts who are not withdrawn even after they attack students, sending Aurors to arrest Dumbledore. People might argue that Fudge and Umbridge might have gone over her head but that implies that she either didn't know how to wield the power she had or was definitely not as influential as Crouch for example who managed to make the Unforgivables legal and gave the Auror excessive powers during his time and according to the information we have, he was basically the de facto Minister in the matters that concerned the First War. Unless, of course, this is one of those instances of subtle misogynism that pop once in a while in the story... you know, Amelia being a woman under a male Minister, while Crouch was a man under a female Minister (Bagnold).

Also Dumbledore cowering in front of anybody when he's caught to having been up to no good. This often occurs with McGonagall. First of all, McGonagall is extremely loyal to Dumbledore and I think she'd choose Dumbledore's judgment over Harry's well-being any time. Don't forget that it's her who informs Dumbledore how awful the Dursleys are, but still does not do anything because Dumbledore's says that that's the best option they have. Furthermore, while Dumbledore may often act kind, relaxed and jokes about how some of the staff of Hogwarts bully him, he has a very dominating presence and when he gets serious or angry, he is described as downright scary. The guy took out nine death eaters single-handedly and was not afraid to curse top government officials to facilitate his escape. So I'd doubt that if he had a hidden agenda, he'd cower in front of the stern looks from his Deputy Headmistress or the head of the DMLE and just accept his arrest as most Dumbledore bashing fics portray him.

Also on the same note, Dumbledore is also portrayed often light-hearted and polite to people, even those that act antagonistic towards him, but he is not afraid to show his displeasure with them (Fudge, Voldemort, Fenrir or even Harry) and stand his ground. I feel like a lot of writers mistake his politeness and subtle sass with meekness and weakness.

Undeniably smart but quick to dismiss stuff that has no logical explanation (think of her disregard for Harry & co. when they tell her that Snape's trying to steal the Philosopher Stone or her dismissal of Divination when the whole action of the series is driven by a prophecy).

*** Honestly, I blame the movies.

In the books, Ron actually had a lot of valuable contributions - if they needed someone to explain Magical culture, it would usually be Ron doing the talking whereas in the movies it's usually Hermione. (see: Hermione getting called a mudblood in Chamber of Secrets).

Basically all of his heat-of-the-moment contributions also go to Harry and Hermione - in the books, it's /Ron/ who has to tell Hermione to make a fire to kill the Devil's Snare, and earlier during the troll scene Ron gets the /idea/ to use the Levitation Charm on his own (and then does it correctly without Hermione having to tell him to swish-and-flick).

A lot of decisions that Ron makes, or that are made as a full group, also tend to not have Ron's input in the movies. Pay attention to every time Movie!Harry (or Movie!Hermione) tells Movie!Ron to do something - odds are, Book!Ron would not have needed the prompting to do it.

The moment where it becomes /most/ obvious that the movies hate Ron, though, is in third year. When Snape takes over the DADA class for Lupin and calls Hermione an "insufferable know-it-all", in the books Ron defends Hermione and gets a detention for it - Movie!Ron instead /takes Snape's side/, saying "he's got a point".

A lot of fanfic authors, then, base their fanfic off of the movies - they are a more accessible media than the books, for many people.

As such, plenty of wizards who are fully qualified, by which I assume Lupin means, have completed their NEWTS, would not have put much time into actually perfecting the charm. Or perhaps any for that matter.

This is consistent with the DA as they had to work hard on the patrons charm, it took a lot of work even with a very good teacher who was intimately familiar with the spell.

They don't like to admit that the character changed, that before they weren't nice, but now they are, or vice versa. If you look at our society, the same thing is happening: more and more people look at the world in a black and white view, especially with Cancel Culture and social media. People (and characters) must be for or against, and the moment there is a hint in one direction (either good or bad) people latch onto that. Snape loved Lily and fought against Voldemort, so he must be good. James was mean to Snape, so he must be bad. Honestly, it's tiring to always categorize characters. Why can't we just look at things the way they are, and see the world in shades of grey?

*** Also I add to the point 4: misconceptions about Hermione and her and Ron's relationship, portraying Ron as a abuser/terrible person, just cause he has a spine to bicker on with her (which she clearly enjoys) when Hermione is more prone to physical abuse than Ron (and especially prone to violence when things don't go her way). Hermione is not that great of a person to hang out with (especially if you don't like nerdy, geeky types who like to spent most of the days in the library studying), she can be extremely annoying, stubborn, bossy and my-way-or-the-high-way most of the time.

She has zero emotional maturity. Zero(but again she is a teen and after some time, that will develop, so it's all right). But even the books were written like we should side with Hermione just cause her feelings were hurt(and cause she is author's self interest), not with Ron cause Ron lost his pet/was hexed with canaries just cause he kissed another girl, especially when Hermione gave him plenty of reasons that she is not interested in him through out all the years/was punched when he returned back when they went to the Hunt (even though he was wearing a Horcrux and Harry precisely told him to leave, so he did => even though this was justifiable). Rules apply to everyone except in case of her. Just her prideful behavior towards Harry (and Ron) in the OoTP and HBP is worth ten times more of the bashing Ron ever unjustly got. Hell if she did that to me, I'd just drop the friendship. She is good to you if you do things as she wants them to be done, regardless if you know what she wants or no. If her feelings were hurt, better hide to escape her wrath.

I know that Ron is immature also (duh, he is a teen), but he is the realest to his age character the series has got. In comparison to her, he grows in character to be a better person. Hermione's flaws and behavior were never, or were just rarely called out. She never gets an character arc to be tested upon(every time she makes a big mistake, something bigger happens to the trio and the her mistake is just swept under the rug). And that's why I think she is not an amazing character or anything special. Rowling's special treatment made her that way.

Yes but just in the PS-POA period(my theory is that one of the sole reasons for it is that majority fans of the book were Ron fans when the first three of them came out, and that Rowling hated it and wanted to elevate Hermione more). But even then, the Scabbers fight was placed in a way "hur dur terrible Ron, Hermione is crying". Ron had a Sokka potential if he was just focused on a little bit more. Hermione would felt much more human to me if we had a character arc when she realized she done something wrong (like hexing her best mate, and that she is sorry for it, but we don't see that at all) and faces the consequences about it. It's not that I hate her, I just don't see the point of hyping her more than Ron(or Harry from the main characters).

** When people act like Hermione was perfect and Ron was just awful.

Ron was a normal teenage boy, it was Hermione who was the odd one out: over the studying. Most normal kids don't do obsessive studying. And I know people like to say if they were magical kids, they would study a lot, but if you were born into it like Ron was, and it looked like other Muggleborns didn't do obsessive studying, either, just Hermione, so she was an exception, not the rule.

People act like Ron was the one to only be insensitive, Hermione was insensitive as well!

When she heard Lavender's bunny had died and heard that Lavender believed what Trelawney said came true, instead of saying sorry for the loss of Lavender's pet, she scoffed and ridiculed her for believing in Trelawney.

Oh no, Crookshanks who is a cat, couldn't possibly have eaten Scabbers who was a rat (Well, what they knew at the time). She scoffed and ridiculed the very idea of it.

She scoffed and ridiculed Luna's beliefs in magical creatures and conspiracies.

Going behind Harry's back and telling McGonagall about the broom. Yes, Sirius was the one to give Harry the broom after all. But she should have talked him into going to McGonagall. Plus Sirius was a wanted criminal, why would Harry think that Sirius would have the means or money to get the broom in the first place?

Hermione attacked Ron with birds. How was Ron to know that Hermione liked him? He wasn't a mind reader! He couldn't have possibly known. And how logical of a choice was it to attack Ron?

Hermione was upset over Harry's "Cheating" with the Half-Blood Prince Potion Book, which I never bought even for a moment. She was upset he was doing better than her at a subject. If Harry had voluntarily given others copies of the books, Hermione still very likely would have been upset.

Hermione never asked the House Elves what they thought, or even asked if the Hogwart House Elves would want to be free, she just assumed. Are they brainwashed creatures? More than likely. But the way she went about it was wrong. Dobby seemed like the oddball there. House Elves like Winky seemed fine with being a House Elf, and upset at the idea of being free.

Plus, I really do blame the movies. It was obvious that the movies shipped Harry and Hermione hardcore. Every single thing that Canon Ron did in the books, was replaced by either Movie Hermione or Movie Harry, so it makes sense why people would forget the things that Ron did do.

  1. Snape was only mean to his students because he had to keep his cover.

  Really? Because I seem to remember that Quirrell and Crouch both had to keep their cover, and they never mistreated Harry or any of their students (well, except for when Crouch/Moody turned Malfoy into a ferret and bounced him around the corridor). And nobody ever suspected anything about them.
#+end_quote

So I'll grant you that the assumption is bad but not for your stated reason- barty and quirrel had to pretend to be light sided whereas snape had to pretend to be voldemort's so of course a death water pretending to be an order member (or whatever) will behave differently than an order member pretending to be a death water.

As Snape explained later to Bellatrix, he stayed at Hogwarts because that's where Voldemort put him before his failure to kill baby Harry. It was a convenient opportunity but it doesn't mean he had to like it.

But as I said, Snape could have gone about controlling his classes through other ways. Even if you need fear to keep students in line, you can still do the implied threat thing like McGonagall does without actively being a POS to your students. The whole transition from "I can teach you how to bottle glory" speech (which, no matter how much you hate the character, you can't deny that makes his subject sound really interesting) to being a dick always made a little confused as a child when I read the book for the first time.

I don't think Harry really talked about it again after the First celebration (where they thought him saying "I didn't do it" was a way to keep his cover story), I mean Harry is a bit of an associable in the best days (understandable considering his circunstances but still).

I also believe that he his lack of interest in the wealth and glory is justified. I mean, he is Harry Potter, he is already wealthy (though I'm not sure people outside of Hermione and the Weasleys would know that), and he probably already one of the most well known people in the world.

Concerning your last point, I won't say that no Gryffindor ever thought it (people like McLaggen come to mind), but that's stupid. No matter what Harry is, Cedric Digory is the /Hogwarts/ Champion, and the Hufflepuff made it very clear that they were not happy about the situation.

**** In re the first, I think he was physically abused by the Dursleys, or at least, it's likely.

Petunia swung a frying pan at this head, and no, 'dodging it' doesn't excuse it. Vernon regularly goes purple with rage around him and at one point shakes him like a rag doll. Both encourage Dudley to bully him. They had him living in a cupboard and more. It's rather doubtful that these things are singular in nature.

Frankly, as mentioned below, the emotional neglect was probably even worse, but that's not a good thing. It amazes me how /unaffected/ by that emotional abuse he is. He is affected, but not nearly as much as he should be.

Personally I think it likely in general they did abuse him physically, but were smart about it so did it in ways that either wouldn't leave a bruise or it'd be something covered up by clothing. This happens a lot with a certain type of abuser.

Not to mention Rowling actually said at one point that the abuse was portrayed a lot worse, but an editor asked her to remove it. So the implication is she left the hints in, but removed the actual abuse from the story itself.

** Perfect just perfect. I had discussions about almost all of them before and it always irked me. The point about Regulus specifically I think doesn't just apply to him. All the prominent traitors from Voldemorts side get treated like that. Snape and Narcidmssa too. As if their eventual betrayal proved that they never believed in the cause in the first place, didn't hate muggles and just went along, because they had no other Option. I'm so tired about all these 'not all slytherins were bad' lists pointing at former death eaters as 'good slytherin'. Virtually any ordinary slytherin Who didn't end up joining voldemort and just vanished in obscurity after graduation never to be heard of again in the books, has a better record than they do. I love a lot of these characters with a passion, but they are decidedly grey characters, not good people.

In the books Narcissa lools at those below her as if they stink, she insults Hermione more harshly than even Lucius ever did to her face I think... and yet somehow she's just the innocent wife Who never liked her husbands nightly activities and eventually put a stop to it.

James' constant bashing also annoys me. Yeah he was a bully to snape. But he wasn't an idiot or a sexual predator.. or a bad friend. The same with Sirius though it's less severe with him. Unlike James, Sirius has a strong fanbase, but he also gets critizised rather harshly, assuming some nefarious Motivation behind his actions...

I know Arithmancy is probably in fanon the most interesting class because it has to do with numbers and people automatically assume it's a way to mathematical model magic in order to explain it, however in books it's implied that it's a glorified form of numerology which even a "Muggle" like me can understand given the charts and interpretations of numbers. Ancient Runes basically implies learning a new alphabet. Most of the people that grew up in Eastern Europe or those from Middle/Far East know at least two alphabets. Muggle Studies it's probably like those classes on Culture and Civilization that people take in High School or College about customs of a foreign culture.

In my opinion, Divination is the most impossible one because you either have a talent for it or not and Care for Magical Creatures is the most dangerous one and not only because of Hagrid... Kettleburn lost a few limbs as well.

** I wrote about this in another thread the other day, but it fits well here too.

I'm currently reading New Blood, and it's one of the many, many fanfics where wizarding Britain is told to be either paganist or atheist and that Christian cultural elements are coming in with Muggle-borns. This is such a common fanon concept with absolutely no basis in canon that I've grown annoyed with it.

Many things in the Harry Potter books (I don't care about any other material) suggest that British witches and wizards are just as Christian as their Muggle neighbours.

1. They celebrate Christian holidays such as Easter, Hallowe'en and Christmas, and at least the Christmas song Sirius sang in 1995 mentions God.

2. One of the Hogwarts ghosts was a friar in life.

3. At least in Godric's Hollow wizards and Muggles share a graveyard that is located next to a church.

4. Phrases "my God", "thank God" and "for God's sake" are being used quite commonly by wizard-raised people such as Ron, Mrs Weasley, Lupin, Malfoy and Fudge.

5. The mainstream ethics of wizarding Britain does not seem to have any significant difference to that of Muggle Britain, and the mainstream ethics of Muggle Britain is based on Christianity.

There is absolutely no evidence about wizards being pagans or atheists. Clearly J. K. Rowling intended wizards to be Christians, but decided not to tell it explicitly because it would have caused controversy without adding anything to the story.

Fanfiction apparently attracts people who have some grudge against Christianity, and they make this grudge a part of their worldbuilding. Usually it adds nothing to the story, and that's why it feels to me similar to character bashing. I think some young writers bash all authority figures because they have problems with authority in their own lives, or Ron if they have problems with their own friends. I don't like stories that feel like a vent for the writers' little problems, and that's why I'm not interested to read protestations against Christianity. Paganism could be an actually interesting part of worldbuilding, but the story would have to explain why British wizards were still pagans in the late 17th century when magical and Muggle societies separated.

My headcanon is that before the Statute of Secrecy wizards were actually religious leaders to the Muggles who used magic to fake miracles. Why wouldn't they have done so?

And the inscription on the Potters' grave is a bible verse: "The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death." 1 Corinthians 15:26.

Canon has very little religion in it, and when an author wants to make religion more prominent, they usually write about something other than Christianity. Probably because plenty of readers actually believe in Christianity and might get annoyed with any particular interpretation an author chooses to write. And also because it's familiar and mundane and part of real life, while pagan religions are exotic and magical. There's something almost 4th wall breaking and kind of lame about giving Christianity a big role, because it immediately begins to feel like proselytizing or Sunday school. Like, if Harry invokes the power of Jesus Christ to defeat Voldemort, it's hard not to read that like the author promoting Christianity, and also pretty lame. But invoking an Incan blood god or something is interesting and badass, and still firmly within the realm of fiction.

Differences from canon don't bother me, though. All fanfics are different from canon, by definition. If I didn't want that, I would just reread the originals. And besides, the fics that adhere to canon most closely are usually not as good as the AUs. I don't need to read yet another fic with all the same stations of canon, except with Harry being more powerful and giving occasional self-important speeches. AUs like New Blood or Prince of the Dark Kingdom or Blood Crest are way more interesting.

I would suggest that, if anything, this would be the position of most of Hogwarts.

In terms of your points 1 to 5, everything except for point 2 equally apply to basically every non-religious person I know.

I do question why wizards would believe given that they learn how to do half the miracles in the Bible before they've reached 6th form. In any event, I don't think that religion would be any more prevalent in wizarding britain than it is in the muggle world, which is to say not a lot beyond a tick mark on the census.

There is no real foundation for your claims that JKR meant for the magic population of Britain to be religious in general or Christian in specific; I'm assuming that you're Christian and are upset that your particular religious belief doesn't get shown more in fanfiction. But as that article I linked above says, "The activities of the wizards are hidden from the non-discerning eyes of the Muggles; and since in our world, Europe and Britain are primarily Christian, if a writer does not mention Church, then he/ she is most likely portraying a secular world."

I said that it has no basis in canon that British wizards are pagans or atheists. Sure, you can argue that they may be atheists because all my examples can be explained as coincidences or conveniences, but even then you'll have to explain those things away.

**** I was expecting someone to point out this thing.

I consider it extremely unlikely that many actual witches and wizards would have been killed in the witch-hunts, and equally unlikely that the rest of the wizarding world would have cared. Since wizards are capable of Disapparating and Confunding and Obliviating Muggles, how would any competent adult wizards get caught and killed by them? And even if they did, why would some pure-blood aristocrats have cared? They seem to care so little about their fellow wizards that they're willing to kill them by themselves. Do you think Lucius Malfoy would have got angry if Muggles had killed Mundungus Fletcher? In conclusion, most likely almost all people killed in the witch-hunts were Muggles, and most wizards did never even know Muggles were trying to kill them.

Besides, I wouldn't say that witch-hunts were actually a Christian thing. It was certainly justified as such, but people willing to oppress and kill others usually find justification from anywhere. And think about it from the wizards' perspective. Let's say they were just as Christian as Muggles when the witch-hunts began in earnest in the 16th century. A group of Muggles comes to kill them, yelling some biblical slogans. Do the wizards decide to abandon Christianity because of that? Or do they think the Muggles are misguided?

Before the scientific revolution the biblical explanation of the world was what most people believed in, even if they were not personally religious. People usually believe in what other people around them believe in. Magic in the Potterverse doesn't seem to offer any clear explanation to the deepest mysteries of existence. Therefore it makes total sense that before the Statute of Secrecy wizards believed that God created the world etcetera. Since after the Statute cultural influx from the Muggle world diminished, it is unlikely that wizards would have learned of theories like the Big Bang or evolution. Then, logically, in the late 20th century wizarding Britain should actually be much more Christian than Muggle Britain.

***** Maybe the confusion here is because I'm not Christian and I don't see it as the default state of being, but I don't see how a religion instituted in direct opposition of the idea of personal power and magic would in any way be the dominant religion of a group of magical people.

The Bible is explicitly anti-witchcraft. The correlation of devil worship and witchcraft is a large and explicit part of Christianity, especially a few hundred years ago. Churches and Christians all over the world tried to get Harry Potter banned in the 90s and 2000s because it was supposedly promoting witchcraft among children. Do you not remember the hysteria against Dungeons and Dragons?

Also, why exactly would they hide the existence of magic of they were too powerful to get hurt? Why would the statute of secrecy need to be a thing at all unless the magical world were in clear danger of eradication? Why did they not put up a fight? Muggles back then didn't even have the kind of firepower they do today.

The idea that no "real" witches got hurt during the various witch hunting phases of Christianity, but also that they felt the need to hide every nook and crevice and corner of every magical thing in the history of ever and allow the part they played in the evolution of humanity and life on Earth in general to fade away into myth and legend is a load of nonsense.

Their Christianity is likely very different from yours, because the Christian God, on paper, according to His words, wants them to burn in hell for all of eternity. For existing.

****** Most of those why's can only be explained with, "Sometimes JKR's worldbuilding makes no sense." Based on the capabilities of witches and wizards shown in the Harry Potter books, we can state with absolute certainty that Muggles posed no real danger to wizardkind in the 17th century. The real life reason for the Statute of Secrecy to exist is that JKR wanted her fantasy world to exist alongside the real world. We can come up with in-universe explanations, but the witch-hunts are a bad explanation because of how easy it should have been for witches and wizards not to be caught and killed by Muggles.

My headcanon is that there was a kind of an enlightenment in the wizarding world, and a part of its ideology was that Muggles should have the right to rule themselves. That's why the wizarding world isolated itself. A bit like how the colonial powers let go of their colonies: not because they had to, but because they thought it was wrong to force their ways upon other nations.

We can also speculate whether the Bible in the Potterverse would be identical to the real world one since it had been written in a world with actual magic. Anyway, I find it likely that witches and wizards who used magic for good purposes (such as healing diseases and injuries) would not have been judged evil beings using the devil's power. On the contrary, they would have been considered holy men and women who got their powers from God. In my headcanon that's how wizards actually got their positions as religious leaders of the Muggles. For example, popes to this day are wizards. They believe that magic is a divine power granted by God, and they use that power to convince Muggles that their religion is the right path to redemption. Then Dark wizards would have been those demonic beings. Since the wizarding world has a clear separation between Dark and non-Dark, why wouldn't that separation have spread to the Muggle world in the pre-Statute era?

******* Canonically there was a witch (Wendilin the Weird I think?) who liked to get caught and “burned” at the stake after casting a flame freezing charm on herself, and did this multiple times.

There is a point to be made that young, untrained witches (and wizards but most likely witches because misogyny) who hadn't been trained, displayed accidental magic, and were killed as a result. Which is a great fanon source of why the statute happened, and why anti muggle sentiment has festered in the wizarding world for so long (other than just “people are the worst”)

Halloween is a Christian calendar based holiday, it's the eve of All Hallows day (November 1st). It would be no different than if Christmas Eve took on a more pronounced day to engage in festive activities to the point that it was it's own holiday.

The date for Christmas is 9 months after the Feast of the Enunciation (Mary's conceiving of Jesus) of March 25th. It is not based on any pagan holiday.

Almost all modern attempts to link Christian holidays to explicitly pagan practices are predominately based on rehashing old anti-Catholic 17th Century Protestant propaganda.

While there were pagan feasts that had their date co-opted/repurposed on the calendar, the contemporary conceit that Christians are dupes aping pagan practices unknowingly is not supported by the historical record.

Snape, on the other hand, was a double agent. He wasn't trying to pretend to just be some normal guy, because Dumbledore knew he was a DE and Voldemort knew he was in the OotP. To convince Voldemort that he's ultimately Voldemort's spy, he needs to act like not like Dumbledore's supporter, but like Dumbledore's /spy/.

Because they weren't. Borderline or otherwise. But Percy got 12 top marks.

#+begin_quote
  As Hermione had predicted, the sixth years' free periods were not the hours of blissful relaxation Ron had anticipated, but times in which to attempt to keep up with the vast amount of homework they were being set. Not only were they studying as though they had exams every day, but the lessons themselves had become more demanding than ever before. Harry barely understood half of what Professor McGonagall said to them these days; even Hermione had had to ask her to repeat instructions once or twice.
#+end_quote

Meanwhile, at the same age, Dumbledore - a true genius - was being published in academic journals.

So on the one hand you have Dumbledore, someone so talented with magic even as a child that his examiners couldn't understand what he was doing, and who could go toe to toe with adult scholars in academic journals. And on the other hand Hermione, someone who does very well in performing her schoolwork but still has to work hard to do well, and still struggles with some concepts rather than them coming to her easily and immediately.

Personally I would not even place Hermione on the same level as Sirius and James, who "know it all" without having to study:

#+begin_quote
  “I'm bored,” said Sirius. “Wish it was full moon.”

  “You might,” said Lupin darkly from behind his book. “We've still got Transfiguration, if you're bored you could test me. Here...” and he held out his book.

  But Sirius snorted. “I don't need to look at that rubbish, I know it all.”
#+end_quote

Hermione is much more like Remus: accomplished, but mainly as a result of her intelligence and hard work, not sheer innate brilliance. People like Sirius, James, Dumbledore etc. just "get" magic on a level that Hermione doesn't.

So yes, JKR said that Hermione is a borderline genius. But to refuse to analyse this statement any further and just repeatedly insist that "JKR said it so it must be true" betrays the true motive for latching onto this comment: it is not a genuine desire to understand the text, but rather the act of looking for any excuse to super up Hermione.

There are two kinds of author statement. There's an author statement of the facts of their fictional universe - e.g. "Godric's Hollow is in the West Country". Then there's an author statement where the author states an opinion or judgement based on those facts e.g. "Snape is a good man."

The first type of statement is within JKR's power to make. She dictates the facts of the universe. But the second type of statement is in the hands of the reader. How one interprets the text varies from person to person. Whether Snape is a good man depends on your idea of what constitutes "good".

Similarly, whether you consider Hermione a "borderline genius" depends on what you consider genius to be. JKR, apparently, has a reasonably low bar for what counts as a genius: a very intelligent person who works hard to achieve academic success at the upper end of normal achievement - a "straight O" student. So in JKR's view, Hermione is a borderline genius and that's fine.

But one has to be careful of taking JKR's statement and then switching out JKR's idea of what constitutes genius for your own. If you consider genius to be Dumbledore-level ability with magic, then Hermione is patently not it.

So you consider Hermione, who is able to learn the course material every summer without spending a significant time on it from what we see, cast multiple spells on the Hogwarts Express on her first few tries when it usually takes people /hours/ (being able to cast a few spells on her first try in her first year, practicing the Summoning Charm), and is able to go from reading the fourth year course books on the train to taking O.W.L. practice tests in early November of that year while having to juggle school, homework, S.P.E.W, extracurricular reading, and friends, not "on the same level" as Sirius and James just because they're able to master the material while learning at the same pace as everybody else? Maybe it's just me, but I consider Hermione's learning ability much more impressive.

Also, I consider it very insincere to act as if she is studying to learn the material everyone else learns in classes. She's literally described as reading multiple textbooks to go deeper into the theory while everyone else is reading a few chapters and covering material that isn't learned in school like alchemy, dark magic, healing, fun trivia, law, protective charms, random nifty charms she finds, House-elf slavery, random pieces of complex magic that are only mentioned when the plot demands it, and various bits of history. The only times she is described as actually studying the basic course material is when she's revising for the exams in the six weeks or so before them, and Ron even points out how it's stupid since she already knows all the material.

  JKR, apparently, has a reasonably low bar for what counts as a genius: a very intelligent person who works hard to achieve academic success at the upper end of normal achievement - a "straight O" student.
#+end_quote

First of all, Hermione's not just a "straight O" student. She's literally able to regularly learn a year's worth of material in 2 months with little effort, solve multiple mysteries that nobody else in the school can, learn a foreign legal system in 6 months while swamped by homework and suffering from slight sleep depravation, master tons of topics not included in the curriculum, easily cast magic that was called complex by /Dumbledore/ in reference teen Voldemort casting it just from reading about it, and outsmart various adult who are said to be intelligent. But sure, she's totally not a genius, and cannot touch James and Sirius.

Second of all, it's ridiculous to say that Rowling wasn't /actually/ using the most commonly used definition and was instead referring to any student who got good grades. Especially since she was commenting on how Hermione was much more clever than her, and Rowling got really good scores when she was a student.

***** Hermione is notably great at avoiding fixed function and innovating brand new uses for pre-existing spells. I think a better example for creativity is actually the way she used the impervious charm to help Harry see better in the rain during that Quidditch match in PoA. The upperclassmen obviously know the spell (as we see in HBP), but it is only Hermione who thinks to apply it that way. Similarly, Hermioneis the only person we see using the bluebell flames to keep warm even when everyone else seems to be cold and it's a good way to fix that problem.

While we don't see much of invention on her end, I tend to place that due to lack of interest as opposed to lack of skill and creativity. Contrary to popular fanon, Hermione's greatest skills had always lain in thinking out of the box and using magic in creative ways.

**** To be even more fair, what could she have invented during her 4th-6th year that would have been both plausible and useful?

To be more concrete, suppose, very generously, that inventing a new spell takes only 5 times as much effort as mastering an existing spell of comparable complexity and magnitude. Can you describe a spell that,

1. would have been similar in scope to inventions of Snape and the Marauders (e.g., not a version of the Shield Charm that stops the Killing Curse);
2. would be in character for Hermione to want herself and/or her allies to use (e.g., not Secumstempa);
3. would not have required any resources or information not available to her at Hogwarts (e.g., Legilimency or Occlumency training, Dark Arts not found in Hogwarts library); and
4. would actually be more conducive to Hermione's goals at the time than spending the time learning several existing spells (or whatever nonmagical side quest she was on)?

I am not asking for much here: just something plausible, in-character, feasible, and useful enough to be worth the time and the effort. If you want people to accept the claim that Harry and/or Ron would have surpassed Hermione academically had they just worked harder, surely you would be just as generous to the claim that Hermione would have invented spells, had she just had a good reason to work on that?

I've asked this question before on other forums, and the least bad answer I've gotten so far is in the GoF year, some alternative to the Bubblehead Charm that Harry could use in the Second Task. That's a pretty weak example for a number of reasons (only 4th-year, 4 weeks to invent+teach, has to be something 4th-year Harry could trust with his life, Bubblehead Charm perhaps existing but too difficult or obscure, etc.).

Meanwhile, compare with the others you've listed:

- Snape was a half-Muggle in Slytherin during Voldemort's first rise. For him to establish himself as an inventive and dangerous wizard was a matter of life and death. Rivalry with the Marauders also helped.
- Marauders had a hobby that involved novel magic. They also were a team and had a rival who could be beaten with magic (Snape). Hermione had neither.
- Weasley Twins had a dream that required inventing novel magical items, and they worked at it just as hard at it as Hermione, to the point of failing most of their unrelated classes. In the end, their enchantment work, though more flashy and zany, was not that much more potent than Hermione's.
- Luna, IIRC, didn't do anything particularly extraordinary magically or academically.

For Hermione, magic and studies were never the top priority. Social justice, helping others, and occasional bouts of romantic moping were, even when they detracted from her studies.

**** Hermione somehow jinxed the DA members list so that the sneak got permanent pustules, and she had studied magic less than five years at that point. Clearly she has a knack for using magic to do what she wants. The contrast to Harry is very striking. At the end of the series, Harry doesn't seem to be able to do anything but basic spells and a few more challenging ones such as the Patronus and Apparition.

If Hogwarts was a school of computer skills, at the end of the series Hermione would be an accomplished software developer while Harry would only know how to use basic programs. Also Fred and George and the Marauders are creative magic users.

I think it's annoying that Harry never actually learns anything but the basics. Fred and George got poor grades, but after five years of education (at the start of GoF) they already had invented their prank sweets. Harry got good grades, but after six years he demonstrates absolutely no such magical proficiency as Hermione and the twins at much younger ages.

Apart from the Patronus, they are all basic spells, and I have no idea how Hermione didn't learn them as well as Harry. Perhaps Harry just had more motivation because he had to learn them for the Triwizard Tournament.

But one thing is certain: Harry did not learn to use his skills to effectively fight against the Death Eaters. As far as I can remember, he defeated Dolohov /four/ times, three times in the Department of Mysteries and once after the wedding. Dolohov was a cold-blooded murderer bent on murdering more people. If Harry had been a competent combatant of a war, he would have killed Dolohov after incapacitating him for the first time. Yes, that's a cruel thing that no teenager should have to do, but it's not the point. Casualties are unavoidable in a war, and it's better for the likes of Dolohov to die than those he killed after surviving.

******** By "basic" I meant that the spells are simple in nature: each has one clear function and they don't do anything else. They are like functions in a computer program. Hermione's jinx on the DA member list is a much more complex piece of magic. It triggered when certain conditions were met and it found the victim wherever she was at the time.

I'd say complex DADA would be something similar. For example, placing some of those basic spells in place to wait for the Death Eaters to attack. This defence system would recognise a Death Eater and start firing curses at him.

That part about competence in war was a little sidetracked, I admit. What I meant is that it's not enough to know the tools you have in defending against the Dark Arts, but also when and how to use them. Harry actually lectured to Ron and Hermione about this in OoTP when Hermione first suggested the defence club. He said that knowing the spells is not enough, but strangely enough, he never taught the DA anything but the spells. If killing enemies is not okay to Harry, at least stealing their wands should be. The thing is, Harry does stupid things all the time. I think DADA is not just a magical discipline. Harry fails to learn very important non-magical things such as stealing the wands of incapacitated enemies. That is something that should be taught to students, and a mindset like it should be a requirement of Outstanding grade.

************* That "analysis" is based on hardly any empirical evidence. To the point of rendering it a sweeping generalisation, again.

Thousands if not millions of characters /of all sexes/ in the history of entertainment publishing have been "denigrated" as author self-inserts with all the attendant negatives. Some people chose to see it through a sexist lens by arguing that overpowered self-inserts in fanfiction /only/ applies to female original characters. To me, this view ignores the former fact, as well as the attendant fact that most Internet fanfiction writers are female. (Empirical fact.)

Or in simple English: most fanfiction writers are amateurs. (I hope this one is self-evident...) Amateurs tend to make overpowered self-insert original characters. Most fanfiction writers are female teenagers. Therefore most overpowered self-insert original characters are female. Therefore criticism of overpowered self-insert original characters will, by sheer dint of numbers, fall mostly on overpowered self-insert /female/ original characters.

Aka Mary-Sues.

****************** By basis I mean the work fanfiction is based upon. Yes, most fanfiction is written by women, but most works in the media are still created by men, and - especially if we're talking about old media like long-running comic series or tv series - suffer from sexist tropes in various degrees.

For example, I have no doubt that a story where Batgirl were written as equal to Batman would be called out as Mary Sueish by people who don't have any problem with the power of Batman - they think elevating a female character to equal the male hero is making a Mary Sue, but won't accept that that would mean the male character was a Sue to begin with.

******************** That would depend on the exact circumstances and arguments used. If we're talking about a distaff version, where the genders of all characters were flipped, and then someone insisted that Hermes is actually dumber than Harriet, then yes, that would be misandrist in my opinion - the only male main character reduced even more in importance while the female lead got boosted even more.

It would be harder to judge if only those two characters were flipped, and the more than a little sexist remaining setup remained unchanged. If there's no smart female character of importance at all, next to Hermes, Dumbledore, Snape, Voldemort etc., (I'm not counting McGonagall since she has about as much agency and impact in the books as a rulebook) then I probably wouldn't call it out as misandry.

To a significant degree, it's about representation, after all. Taking the "smart one" trope from the only female main character and handing it to the male characters is very sexist.

But it's a retroactive addition that feels like cheating to me. If she wanted to communicate all that stuff, it should have been included in the books.

And I think of it like this: if I wrote an essay then got low marks for not putting enough detail. I could write an email adding more detail. Its still my own work. But its not going to change my grade because l didn't included it in the essay - it doesn't count.

*** JKR can say what she wants, but from what we see Hermione isn't a genius, she works herself way too hard to achieve her impressive results.

Snape, James and Sirius are much more what you'd expect from a genius, they pass their exams with flying colours despite barely bothering to revise because they know it all and it's boring, they come up with new magic in their spare time because that's actually interesting.\\
Dumbledore is even more impressive, performing feats his examiners couldn't understand and publishing in research journals.\\
They're people who'd have accomplished great things if the war hadn't claimed them.\\
There's an argument to add Riddle,~~ Dumbledore~~ and Lily to the list, but we don't really get to see much evidence either way. I'd be shocked if +Dumbledore and+ Riddle wasn't, but +we see none of Dumbledore's school days and+ all we see of Riddle is Chamber of Secrets related stuff.

Hermione in comparison mostly just memorised stuff.

** I have a few pet peeves as well, but I share quite a few with you. To add onto your James and Lily point, there's a lot of fanfic writers that will depict Lily with a very toxic and abusive personality that I think is very problematic. I will give a few examples:

1. James decides to ask Lily if she wants to work on a team assignment with him as the professor makes it clear that you can't work with your friends. Instead of saying 'I will think about it' or 'No, I was asked to work on the project with x person' or 'Okay, but we've got to lay down some ground rules', Lily always gets really nasty with James.
2. James is trying to include Lily in a conversation and instead of being nice, she starts yelling at him and is just awful.
3. She calls James nasty names, says he's stupid and that he's worthless, etc.
4. She exhibits gaslighting behaviour that is seen as being quirky and 'bad ass' when she's actually being outright cruel and abusive.
5. One fic I read had Lily physically assault James for no reason at all. She just decided that she was going to attack him and then she hit him with a bunch of hexes and curses that had James in the hospital wing for weeks.

And most of the reviews tell the author how strong Lily is, and how she's so amazing. Nobody calls out the author for depicting a problematic relationship. I feel that if Lily exhibited any of this kind of behaviour (or worse), that James wouldn't have been attracted to her. My head canon of Lily is that she has a strong personality, she knows what she wants and won't stop until she gets it, but she's also kind and considerate to others.

  1. James asked Lily out every single day for six/seven years.
#+end_quote

This one is certainly excessive, but James chasing after Lily while she wasn't into it was definitely a thing in canon. It gets exaggerated in fanfiction, obviously (as all things do), but the 'romanticizing harassment' is something that's basically in the text of the story itself. I don't think the HP series is a particularly... healthy one for relationships, on the whole (if we took the various relationships at face value/if they existed in our world, many tend to have some major issues/red flags)

#+begin_quote

  1. Snape was only mean to his students because he had to keep his cover.

  Really? Because I seem to remember that Quirrell and Crouch both had to keep their cover, and they never mistreated Harry or any of their students (well, except for when Crouch/Moody turned Malfoy into a ferret and bounced him around the corridor). And nobody ever suspected anything about them.
#+end_quote

I think this is a big stretch. Quirrell and Crouch's cover was towards the 'good' side - mistreating Harry would have been /not/ keeping their cover (likewise, Crouch/Moody being anti-death eater was also keeping his cover). Snape's cover was more towards the Slytherins/death eaters, where being anti-Harry would be in line with keeping said cover.

I don't think that's the reason he was shitty towards students - just that if someone's running with that interpretation in an AU type setting, it can be made to fit canon reasonably well.

#+begin_quote

  1. Harry and Ron were stupid.

  Considering Hermione was the top student of their year, alright, I can see why this misconception is so popular. But as much as I love Hermione, I feel it's important to mention that she was notorious for being obsessed with studying while Harry and Ron definitely weren't--and they still managed to get excellent grades regardless. If Harry and Ron had put half as much effort into their studying as she did, it's entirely possible they would have topped her. Plus, speaking purely for Ron here, I'm pretty sure someone who's as dumb as a brick wouldn't be as good at chess as he was.
#+end_quote

Eh, they're not /stupid/, but they're not that smart either. Their grades get buoyed by being friends with Hermione, honestly (she makes them study more than they otherwise would have). I'd put them on the average, more or less (with Harry a bit smarter than Ron). As for chess, it's honestly not really a good measure of intelligence - at high levels it's a lot more pattern recognition than anything else, it's an entirely different mode of 'intelligence' or ability than what we typically mean.

This is the misconception in HP fanfiction that bothers me more than it probably should. Like, the girl who is able to learn all the course material in less than 2 months with little effort and just goes deeper into the subject over the course of the year is not going to be beaten by Ron and Harry, who both have completely average grades if we compare them to the other Gryffindors in their year. No offense, but they already struggle with the regular pace of the classes.

** Hermione is smart at everything

Hermione is really intelligent but she has her particular knowledge base. She's good at understanding and applying concepts of magic and she's decently creative.

Shes not a inventor the way Fred George or the Marauders are.

She's not a tactical genius she can be impulsive especially when stressed Ron has to tell her not to attack the Troll head on because of the collateral damage it would cause.

She's also not a Tom Riddle style expert minipulator and good at reading people. She actually has a habit of being accidentally insulting and not always picking up social cues.

There are other characters around her better suited for those roles and its more interesting seeing them being useful in that way and bouncing off Hermione than it is making her the default "smart one" in every situation.
