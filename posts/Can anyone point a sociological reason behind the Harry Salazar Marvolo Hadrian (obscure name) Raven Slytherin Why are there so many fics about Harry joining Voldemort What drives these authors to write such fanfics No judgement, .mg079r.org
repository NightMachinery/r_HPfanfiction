As it said in the title. I can understand Harry being seduced by the Dark Side and joining Voldemort in oppressing muggles. It makes sense, somewhat. But what I strive to understand is the many, many fics of him abandoning his friends, adopting a new name and usually shacking up with a Death Eater.

I'm not talking about the plausability of such fics, since this is fanfiction. Anyone can write what they want and more power to them.

What I want is to discuss the viewpoint of the author.

It has been done well, keeping true to canon, in BolshevikMuppet's fics. They are disturbing as hell, but well put together.

Some other though, just feed on strange (for me) world viewpoints, without underlining how monstrous Voldemort is. They often whitewash him or make the other side (usually Dumbledore) to be even worse.

There are a lot of consideration and variance in the fics in question.

Why do authors like this trope? What is the reason behind it? What do you think?

If you are an author that writes such fics, what drives you? What is appealing in it? Who do you think is your audience?

I have my own theories. But I would like to hear your thoughts.

No judgement please, be nice. I just think this reddit could use some productive discussion from outside its comfort zone.


** I think there's an appeal to trying to flip the narrative on it's head and see what you can do with it.

I also think that sometimes an author starts with saying 'Dumbledore is just as bad' and then it turns into 'Dumbledore is worse than Voldemort' and then into 'because Dumbledore is worse than Voldemort and Harry has to join a side, he should join Voldemort'.

And then the new name thing is probably because he wants to distance himself, and in a lot of these stories he feels obligated to pick up family names because of a trope that Dumbledore kept his inheritance from him

The abandoning his friends part is usually because they betrayed him in an unforgivable fashion of some sort, like the popular tropes of Ginny love potion-ing him, Ron being a fake friend for influence, and Hermione being a practically blind sycophant to Dumbledore and anyone with authority.

I would like to reiterate my original post. What would drive such stories? I know what they are, but why write them? (NOT that there is anything wrong with that. Fanfiction is wonderful in its diversity!) What desire do they fulfill?

Sorry for haranguing you, but I mostly seek the intent, the motivation, the reason why people write such stories... If it's just because the reversal, which I doubt it is but who knows... would be simply sad.

I think there is more reason behind this trope. There are many stories fulfilling it, perhaps not as many as indy!Harry, but I don't know. I see it pretty often.

** "Cool motive, still murder." - JKR

Voldemort in canon has a pretty tragic backstory. His mum came from poverty, used (societally acceptable) love potions, deluded herself into believing in Love, then abandoned Tom at an orphanage. He lived there in a life without love with only his magic to bring him comfort until he found a home at Hogwarts. From the moment Dumbledore met him, he was profiled against, considered evil, which prevented him from teaching at his beloved home. He alone gathered the oppressed and unwanted of society - the werewolves, Giants, and conservatives - in a Wizarding revolution against a corrupt government.

By accentuating his tragic/misunderstood traits and minimizing /everything/ else, Voldemort can be cast as a "good guy."

Dumbledore collaborated (and fell in love) with literal magic Hitler. He abandoned a baby on a doorstep to abusive muggles, knowing for a fact that he was condemning said child to a loveless existence and doing nothing about it. He stored the Philosopher's stone, a target of a mass terrorist, at a school for children. He left it to said abused child to slay a 60-ft basilisk alone, a werewolf + mass murderer, a death tournament for 7th years, annual character defamation, government-sanctioned torture, and Voldemort himself. And for what? His endgame was to convince an abused /child to voluntarily martyr himself/.

By accentuating his /really/ questionable treatment of children, Dumbledore can easily be cast as the "bad guy." There's a reason the Death Stick chose him.

Tl;dr -- I assume that the "Harry joins Voldemort" trope is an (over)compensation for how the good guys get away with so much in canon, while Voldemort, despite his humanizing origins, is made out to be a moustache-twirler.

** I don't write these but I read a lot of them lol. I suppose, as some commenters have already pointed out, is that the way Dumbledore and the Dursleys don't get any justice AT ALL for all the horrible things they did just isn't very satisfying as a reader. Yes, Dumbledore wasn't actually evil, and certainly not worse than Voldemort, but he gets away with a LOT of negligence of his treatment of students, so I suppose these fics are trying to make up for that?

The abuse from the Dursleys was, in my opinion, not handled as it should have been; it was more of a convenient plot point to have no actual caring adults in Harry's life be able to step in and prevent some of the awful things he went through, than actual abuse. Fanon does exaggerate his abuse, as Harry wasn't beaten bloody or anything, but he was starved, locked up, and emotionally abused. The Dursleys face no repercussions for that, and readers even get the sense that they are trying to redeem themselves (Petunia's deleted scene, as an example). Personally it doesn't sit well with me, and paid that with how Dumbledore continuously forced Harry to go back to them?

The rich, heir to 50 houses thing is odd, I agree; it is a very classist trope. I suppose Lucius Malfoy's Aesthetic(TM) is just sexy lol. Villains are romanticised by fandoms always, especially if they're hot (and BOI was Tom Riddle a smokeshow).

Therefore, characters (Dumbledore and Dursleys) doing bad actions and not really suffering for it + hot villains + unlimited potential = evil!Dumbeldore + anti-muggle!dark!Harry

** I have written these types of fics and I have read them as well, so here's my (admittedly a bit disjointed and I don't feel sufficiently explained) 2¢:

When I was a teenager, a lot of the appeal was in essentially being able to deal with my feelings. Please understand I'm not saying everyone who reads/writes these fics is a teenager or that they should be looked down on if they are. For me, I had a /lot of feelings/ as a teenager that it felt like /no one could ever understand./ I was grappling with personal issues, an increasingly complex view of the world, and beginning to question a lot of the things I'd been taught -- and to be clear, for the most part my teenage years were relatively trauma free, I was just growing up, as you do.

So there was a big attraction to the fact Harry, in joining Voldemort, could basically act out on all the ways he'd been hurt. It was cathartic to me. Harry abandoning the Weasleys due to Ron's behavior in GoF? I /understood/ that and it gave me a way of feeling less powerless about betrayals in my own life that I couldn't do anything about. Or the fact that Voldemort was now the "good" side--well, I had a ton of feelings about how things I'd been taught growing up weren't as crystal clear or actually weren't good AT ALL, and there was a big appeal (and, to be honest, a satisfying sense of rebellion) in being able to say "this is good" even if it wasn't. It was comforting.

A big part of it when I was a teenager was also that, even though if you asked me about it I could tell you all about how awful Voldemort was and how prejudice is wrong and all that, the manifestations of that in Harry Potter didn't always translate to the real non-magical world. In other words, I knew logically that Voldemort was doing awful things and held horrific views where I would never espouse the real-world equivalents, but it was a lot easier for me to ignore or not see the parallels to real world events and suffering.

I recently went and read through a bunch of fics I'd favorited on my teenage FFN account, and a LOT of them fit into what you describe or are variants of it. Looking at them now, most of them just have actions that I can't countenance now. This is true of things I wrote as well.

But that being said, as an adult I still sometimes read fics like this, but nowadays I tend much more towards ones where Voldemort for one reason or another (trapped in a magical artifact? stopped from creating as many horcruxes? reincarnation? other random reason?) isn't /good/ but also isn't reprehensible like he is in canon (particularly canon extrapolated to its logical conclusions and viewed as a parallel to real world events/figures) OR where he is that bad but Harry's corruption is presented as neither romantic nor ideal. In other words, ones where it's presented as horrific that Harry would join Voldemort.

I like that some of these fics are complicated as well. This has a lot to do with what originally drew me to these sorts of fics as a teenager. In other words, there's something to be said for having an evil character that is, in many ways, a good person. Because quite frankly in the real world there are a lot of people who do evil things but in other ways are very good people. When I was younger, it was harder to reconcile that. But now I know that doing bad things doesn't negate the good, nor does doing good things negate the bad. It just is.

To take one associated trope in particular, a common theme you'll find in many "Harry joins Voldemort and/or becomes a Dark Wizard" is that that even Death Eaters would be horrified by the Dursleys' (and/or Dumbledore's) treatment of Harry because "wizarding children are special/sacred/the future." To some extent this makes a lot of sense. The Malfoys, particularly Narcissa, are shown to care for Draco, for example. And so there's something there about people who do evil and hateful things also doing good and loving things. And that's a really cool dynamic to explore, and one that can shine a light on how people are in the real world. Because in reality people aren't all good or all evil. But the problem is when the depiction isn't nuanced enough--when you get the "because the Malfoys love Draco they must be all good and are really just misunderstood" or "well, it's OKAY that they're blood supremacists because Muggleborns really are ruining Wizarding culture so it's JUSTIFIED racism." It's hard to depict a character that is a loving parent and also a racist murderer.

Also, and for the easiest answer, I've been a sucker for hero/villain relationships for basically forever--there's no way I'd want one in the real world, but they can have really intriguing (to read, not to live through) relationship dynamics.

*tl;dr: For me, a lot of the appeal is in relationship dynamics, investigating complexities of how people work, and seeing personal experiences/feelings reflected in fanfic in a cathartic way, but often times the writing isn't nuanced enough so it becomes an "evil people are really good" thing instead of "people are complicated and don't fit into neat categories" thing.*

*** Thank you for the reply, it was exactly what I was hoping for. It was very interesting to see your perspective.

Yeah, I can see that fascination and coupled with teenage rebellion (as good a term as any) it is logical that it lead to such fics.

The appeal of the Evil side is also understandable, they are cool. Especially in HP films when the bad guys (especially if you consider Snape a bad guy) were played by some very good actors and the good guys ... weren't (apart from Gary Oldman).

I think your viewpoint was the best one so far. It really hammers the point right down to the middle.

** I think it's just because a lot of authors get annoyed with how passive Harry was in canon.

When you think about it, there's more than enough evidence to suggest that Harry had the potential to actually become a really powerful wizard capable of facing a Dark Lord without relying on sheer luck and friends to survive--- but the potential was wasted, considering how he made use of it. He's quite lazy (though this is more an effect of being forced to hide talent when he lived with the Dursleys--- he never had a responsible adult that he felt safe around and trusted, who told him it was okay to do better, and set those expectations, so he just carried on), and relies on his friend as a crutch to save him in situations where he can and should perform better, time and time again.

His POV with regards to the Dursleys is... at times understandable considering the trauma of the neglect/abuse, but it's still vindicating to see him react with less inhibitions.

Every single book is basically him coming to Hogwarts after a terrible summer, letting himself be provoked by Draco Malfoy and trying to obsessively stalk and/or attack him (usually failing to do so without Hermione's help), getting bullied by Snape, and then almost getting killed by a Professor--- which would be fine if he learned from all that and showed some character development earlier on instead of as late as it took in canon, but that wasn't the case.

He lets things go way too easily--- I can't be the only one annoyed with how he handled the reunion with Ron in the Goblet of Fire, or the Deathly Hallows.

He's also a bit naive and more than a little self-righteous. He's still very likable, which is a big reason why the overwhelming majority of fanfics center his character and most readers prefer that POV being the predominant (if not singular) one.

I also think he is a bit bigoted himself, towards Slytherins, and towards Dark abilities like Parseltongue, which isn't intrinsically evil (I REALLY wish he had a pet snake in canon). I despise the Cursed Child storyline, and I think Harry would've actually been a great (albeit flawed) parent, but Hogwarts-era Harry honestly might have acted the way that Cursed-Child-Harry did towards Albus Potter without the character development and growth that Harry ultimately went through at the end of canon. He is a bit like his dad James in that regard, though unlike James (and Sirius), he likely would've been able to recognize he'd crossed the line at some point, like Harry sort of did in OotP and HBP.

After reading a lot of fanfic where you can twist all of that around, I think a lot of authors just decide to go over the top. Thus, Harry Potter becomes Hadrian Pendragon Sayre Tudor Blah Blah, his mother was actually a pureblood (somehow) and now he's the highest ranking member of the aristocracy, he transforms into an overpowered edgelord with a harem, his insecure/jealous friend (Ron) and condescending friend (Hermione) go from being flawed but likable to evil wretches laid to be his friends who would betray him without a second thought, and he becomes the infamous indie! Harry we've all grown tired of.

Him hating Muggles would make sense because of the Dursleys, though I think he'd still be fine with Muggleborns in this case because of his mother, and wouldn't be a full-on Blood Purist. Him joining Voldemort makes sense because it's not like he can remember the parents he lost, Dumbledore is just as bad in many (though not all) ways, and he presumably wants a quiet life more than he wants to be the hero. The rest of it though, is just overindulgence by authors who get excited at creating a Dark-ish, Mary Sue, Harry Potter.

**** A lot of people have that opinion. But personally, I just don't understand why achieving your potential precludes character growth and interpersonal relationships. I agree part of the charm of the series is that Harry isn't some all-powerful godlike figure and achieves what he does largely through his friends and good luck. But then there's a difference between someone who legitimately doesn't have that capability and makes do, versus someone who does have it but ignores it altogether, never learning.

From what we've seen in the series, Harry is more than capable of being good at Potions when he /wants/ to be, like when he saw Snape's memory and felty sympathy and made that Invigoration Draught perfectly. He also is able to cast multiple spells effectively on the first try, at levels that adult wizards can't reach, and is able to teach others as well, despite disregarding magical theory and the wand movements/incantation intricacies that people like Hermione are much better at. Examples include Levicorpus, Crucio, Sectumsempra, Imperio, Muffliato, etc. One of the most impressive adult witches at beauxbeatons, Fleur, isn't even able to make it past a grindylow while Harry not only does that but deliberately acts against them and stays with all the hostages in the lake until the end. Per the twins in HBP, most Ministry adults (even Aurors) can't cast functioning shield charms, yet Harry is able to do that at a level that's quite difficult to break through (he even deflects Snape's legilimency one time, which is saying something considering how powerful Snape was), and also taught other students this as well. All it took for him to do nonverbal casting was the absence of Snape (although he did read to do it from Snape's book).

Hermione, while being a bookworm, still made more than enough time to talk with Ron and Harry and go on various adventures and sneak out past curfew, etc.

The series is basically littered with examples of showing that Harry has the capability to become a really impressive wizard, but his utter disdain for power and lack of ambition makes him disregard that, and that supposedly makes him a more moralistic character who defeats Voldemort, per the moral of the story. I think the message that should have been pushed more, that Rowling likely intended to do to a degree but also toned down too much, was that power and ambition don't mean evil, but also aren't everything, and that while Voldemort was powerful, Harry's strength of character gave him an edge (but only an edge, /not a crutch/).

Ron Weasley at 11 years old cast a levitation charm so strong, it knocked out a fully grown Mountain Troll with its own club. He's no slouch himself. And he was a great character, albeit flawed. Sirius Black was the same, and he was pretty powerful. It doesn't mean that they'd be any less likely to die for the people they care about.

I don't think powerful Harry necessarily means indie! Harry, though that's certainly a common trope in fandom.

*** Harry was extremely passive and kind of sad in canon books. Even more so in the films (film Hermione is one of my pet peeves).

But I don't think that's the main reason. I wasn't talking about Indy!Harry fics. They are a different topic. Those fics are exactly what you talk about, a power fantasy that enables Harry to do shit and kick some ass.

My point was about the various Harry gets adopted/married/enlightened by the Voldemort side and becomes Hadrian Rasputin Marvolo Dracula Slytherin (gosh, it's fun writing that), falls in love with Snape or Barty Croush jr. or one of the Lestrange brothers, joins Voldemort and gets a personality transplant through whatever means necessary. There are many, many fics like that and have been for years.

Indy!Harry is totally different. Since Indy!Harry is always opposed to Voldemort, even if he doesn't care about Wizarding Britain and tells them to fuck off... (which is a totally separate issue, not germane to this topic).

Similar to how people came up with the headcanon that House elves supposedly die without being enslaved--- after associating canon Harry with a lot of the righteous civil rights stuff in canon, like S.P.E.W and Muggleborn rights and all that ish, people try to explore what would've happened if circumstances made it so that he ended up like the early version of Draco Malfoy. Of course, that's mainly to do with the “Harry being adopted by some pure blood family and joining Voldemort” and all that ish.

I have no idea why they go to the crazy lengths of placing him at the /top/ of the aristocracy and give him all those Lordships and all that--- maybe just overindulgence in making Harry as opposite as possible from canon?

There is a feeling of your protagonist being better than anyone else by terms of breeding. (This is actually super interesting from a sociologist point of view, since we had almost 200 years of dismantling aristocracy and democracy, therefore such ideas should be abandoned, and yet they crop up in fanfiction. Super interesting)

About the house elves, I just attribute it to laziness not to anything else. Dobby was such a plot device in DH that authors feel justified to reuse it, since it's canon sanctified. I wouldn't expect anything deeper there than that.

** There's always going to be a few reasons, and no one will be the same.

For some, it's driven by dislike of the side that Harry is originally with - usually Dumbledore and/or the Weasleys. Dumbledore in particular has a lot of flaws in canon, which makes it easy to identify problems and holes in the worldview. A part of this is also based in control/independence - canon Harry isn't very independent and gets led along by Dumbledore willingly, whereas some authors would want to see him push back and make his own path.

For others, it's because of the worldbuilding. In a lot of ways, the WW is quite shallow - and that strikes some people the wrong way (eg, Slytherins just being evil). That obviously drives a backlash of authors interested in the world, but also wanting to dive a little deeper - and doing so tends to lead to needing to take a more measured look at things that in the main series can just be dismissed as evil and not really looked at further.

One of the points of fanfiction is being able to change things - so in fanfiction where Voldemort is whitewashed, think of it as an entirely different universe than canon Harry Potter. It's in a universe where that's the truth.

For a non HP example, one that comes to mind is The Last Ringbearer - see its [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Ringbearer][wikipedia page here]]. Sometimes thinking of situations/concepts by flipping around who is good/evil can be interesting - and, depending on the type of story being told, I personally find it more interesting than just blanket good/evil.

** A few people have said about the names being a strange add on.

I'm catholic and my family are from Ireland. I have 7 middle names. So 9 names in total. Thats because I'm a only child and I'm carrying those names into the next generation so to speak.

The Harry into Hadrien or Harrison. Change is psychologically to make this character someone different in a sense. Names are fundamentally difficult to change in other peoples perception. I knew a woman in university who told me her name was one thing and then years later I found out it was her middle name. When I talk about her with others that know her by her first name. It feels wrong saying that name.

Linking back by using a different name, people get upset saying Harry Potter kicks ginny in the face. If the sentence is "Hadrien Potter-Black kicked his life debt slave ginerva in the face in revenge for trying to slip him another love potion" people are less likely to be as grumpy.

That points out that while they are Harry and ginny. They aren't the Harry and ginny you know.

Leading into your next point in your question. Why write Harry joins Voldemort. I've never written any fanfiction. Day dreamt it. But never wrote it down.

Voldemort is reprehensible. However JK kind of wrote a Saturday morning cartoon villain group. Oh so evil and clearly in the wrong. We want to be superior to everyone else. Its pure evil. Its racism taken to the extreme.

Its also the exact sort of propaganda that people are used to seeing in the news constantly.

Taking a semi recent example of Donald trump when he first joined the White House. He accepted a phone call from North korea(might be wrong on the country ). Now the news papers ridiculed him for this act as america doesn't recognise north Korea as a country and as such he shouldn't of done that. And thats fair. But the news didn't point out there were 10 other people in the office at the time, his political advisors who were there to stop things like that from happening. (I'm not pro trump or anything just a case of media bias that popped to mind)

Thinking about it logically. Voldemort and his death munchkins wouldnt work as political party or even as a terror cell as they have no reasonable goals. Pureblood supremacy doesn't work when you're murdering more purebloods than anyone else. So people write as if he had deeper ideals and what we read was just the rita skeeter spin on it all.

And having Harry champion a cause for whatever soapbox the writer wants to put him on works like that.

** I cannot answer why you would call your character 25 names. But as for the rest of it:

As an author, the very reason that drives me to write is to explore people. To study them, figure out 'what makes them tick', how the world shapes them, and how they shape the world. The natural consequence is that "normal" people are boring. Their motivations are a dime a dozen, they are insignificant, and don't shape the world at all. Far more interesting are the exceptions. People that aren't like the rest. People with world views different from the norm. People with conflicting goals. And finally, people with power, able to shape things around them, or with the desire to do such.

Tangentially related to that, I also like to play with perceptions and subjectivity. I love to introduce situations that make /the readers/ questions their convictions, by virtue of relativising the Absolute Good and Absolute Evil, and play with all the nuances in-between. There is no greater reward than when I write about commonly terrible situations or actions, but the reader is nodding along because it makes sense from the POV they are reading. In the end, this works because a potential to be a terrible human being is in all of us, and teasing out that aspect so that it can resonate with the POV creates a mirror for the audience where they end up seeing themselves.

A typical example would be linkffn(11923302)

 

Both combined leads, in terms of HP Canon, to writing from the opposite site the books present: HP is thankful world to write in, precisely because it's so black and white, so if you start writing about the Slytherins, Death Eaters, and Voldemort, the impact is that much bigger, as everyone has the source material in mind. So in this sense, Harry becomes merely a vehicle of getting there, if you want to write about the most popular character -- on the one hand. And on the other hand, exploring different Harrys, or ways in which he becomes different from Canon, is precisely the first point of doing character studies.

*** The idea that there is Absolute Good and Absolute Evil has always been fascinating to me.

As an amateur historian, I was always perplexed how people can even consider such a notion. Perhaps it's a signum temporis, perhaps it's not.

I agree with the reader getting sucked into the perspective and the worldview of the protagonist. Especially an inexperienced one.

A tangent: I always found it amazing that people associate the views of the characters with the author, which is rarely the case in professional authors. Although I've seen a trend developing when that is not the case anymore.

Thanks for your input!

  Each one has his own perspective, but in passing, they entwine.-- In a world with Voldemort, Harry's fight is only one part of the story: A glimpse into life at the eve of revolution. Set during DH, broadly Canon-compliant. Twoshot.

*** I don't think you get the fics or the target audience I'm talking about. I was mostly talking about slash fics with Harry joining Voldemort, usually it happens around the Tri-Wizard but not always.

Most of the issues you are mentioning go into Indy!Harry category not this (although there is some overlap). Which is another interesting conundrum. In which way are they similar? The target audience is probably totally separate, yet similar.

Food for thought.

** Yeah I hate death eater Harry too. The only fics I kinda like that are ones that have Harry/Bellatrix or Harry/femVoldemort bc I can get behind fucking your enemies into allies but most of those end in the bad guys being not bad anymore instead of Harry turning evil.

** i don't really have an answer ro the second part, but as for the naming convention. we have stated several times throughout the books, that dumbledore is the greatest wizard of the time, etcetera etcetera. woi has the long name Albus Percival Wolfric Brian Dumbledore. and we have the "worst dark lord of all time" voldemort aka tom morvolo riddle, morvolo is a strange name by our standarts, and voldemort is powerful. dumbledore has several strange names, and is just as if not more powerful, and hes old, not in his prime. so logic dictates based off of what we know using just the original 7 books, people with longer stranger names because more strange names equals more powerfull/skilled wizard. sombody/somebody's started using the trope, and it stuck. people started to use it more and more, and it got more and more exaggerated.

***** I could accept that. I read some Anne Rice novels, although they weren't for me.

Twilight does that to some degree (although I never read any of the books, nor watched any of the films, all I know about it is the usual anti-Twilight propaganda).

Therefore I can accept that premise but I don't think it's that simple in fanfiction. Is it?
