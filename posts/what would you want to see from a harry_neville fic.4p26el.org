Hi guys,

So I gave my two weeks notice yesterday which means that I care even less about what's going on here than normal. I think I'm going to use my "free" time there to work on a project I've been fiddling with for a while - a Harry/Neville fic called "the boys who lived".

While looking for slash fics (I hadn't really read any) I was struck by the fact that most slash fics star a villain or someone otherwise opposed to Harry (Snape, TMR, Draco or Lucius are most common) and very few where Harry is in a slash relationship with a friend. I've seen a couple of fem!harry/Hermione fics, and I read Cartographer's Craft which was a pretty good Harry/Sirius, but Harry/Ron, say (or any weasley) are pretty scarce on the ground.

If it's not there, then you've got to write it. Okay. I put about 20k words to paper. Not finished, but far enough that I can see what I'm getting into. And I sketched an outline.

It's . . . okay. Not brilliant, by any means, but not awful. But it's kind of . . .flat. Oh look, this fic says, here's another fic where harry gets advanced training and falls in love with someone in the middle of that. Whoop de doo.

So, I'm here to crowdsource my ideating process. What would you want to see in a fic with this premise? What does harry gain from his relationship with Neville? What does he lose? It's kind of ambiguous how the establishment view being gay in cannon; what are your thoughts on it? What are your thoughts on Neville's character? What's in his mirror or erised? I'm considering having them be animaguses; what would Neville's form be? Basically any thoughts or comments on this at all would be helpful and appreciated.


** Neville is a character with a very strong idea of morality, I think - he was raised with and embraces the very ideals of bravery, chivalry and nobility. Unfortunately, rather than being a knight in shining armour with a booming voice and enchanting charisma, he is an endearing but unexciting gardener.

This does not make him any less lovable.

I think some people want so much for Neville to grow that they focus on his killing Nagini in DH, but the best parts of his character are in the little scenes - his eager, friendly fashion, his unwavering loyalty, his ability to stand up to people.

Neville's clumsy with his words, and I don't think he'll ever be a suave public speaker à la Malfoy, but his speeches are from the heart and speak to his ideals.

I think an interesting comparison for the two of them would be their respective hobbies of Quidditch and Herbology - Neville's scared shitless on a broom, and Harry couldn't care less about how shiny the Briny Dragon's leaves get if left in the sun too long. You could have them teach each other, or both approach something new together. They can also bond over Snape's utter ire where the two of them are concerned.

For Neville's animagus, I'm not too sure - initially I thought of a farm animal, but I think for him you'd need some mix of docile and courageous. A bumblebee, maybe. Neville strikes me as a bumblebee.

To go along with this, I think Neville would be influenced by Pureblood customs - at least to some extent - and might feel pressure to marry a woman and/or have a Longbottom heir. I read a Drarry once (cant remember what) and there was a throw away line that Harry realized he was gay after the war when he and Neville got super drunk and fooled around. And that Neville had to let Harry down easy the next day. In that fic it was because he wasn't really into men. But I could imagine a bi-Neville where the conflict is that Neville feels like he has familial duties that Harry doesn't.

*** This was super helpful. Just having someone else reflect on Neville's character for a second opens up a bunch of paths. I can totally see Neville's grandmother impressing on him all the ways he should act 'as befitting a longbottom'. This contrasts a lot with Harry. harry almost never self-reflects, where Neville struggles to be the person he thinks he should be. I can see Neville and harry bonding over the gardening, which leads harry to talk more about the dursleys.

I've read worse fics than this one, pretty sure. Thanks so much for the reply!

**** Sounds cool! Here are my thoughts:

#+begin_quote
  What would you want to see in a fic with this premise?
#+end_quote

I think there would be a lot of similarities to the hogwarts era Wolfstar fics. The conflicts could include: figuring out their sexual preference is for guys (made more interesting by the fact that neither has any experience with girls), hiding their relationship from their roommates, coming out to their friends/roommates, other students finding out, the Daily Prophet writing a story about it, Neville's grandmother not approving, one of the two of them being a lot less serious about the whole thing (one of them wanting a friends with benefits thing and the other being in serious love/lust), (depending on your rating) the awkwardness/excitement of their first sexual experiences.

#+begin_quote
  What does harry gain from his relationship with Neville?
#+end_quote

Neville is also an orphan(ish) with a not ideal home life where he can't be himself. His grandmother is surely way better than the dursleys, but considering his boggart was his gran, it would be cool to explore why he is so afraid of her and how he can relate to harry's shitty home life more than any of his other friends. Also Neville is never in Harry's "fanclub" like some of the other students - he would just treat Harry normally - which is always something Harry wants.

#+begin_quote
  What does he lose?
#+end_quote

Compared to what? A het relationship or a relationship with a different guy like Draco? I think compared to a het relationship is fairly obvious - he loses "normalcy" and potentially the ability to have biological kids (if he even cares about that at 14). Compared to a relationship with someone else, Neville is so much more of a push-over early in the series, so maybe Harry would lose a more balanced relationship that he would have with someone with a stronger personality.

#+begin_quote
  It's kind of ambiguous how the establishment view being gay in cannon; what are your thoughts on it?
#+end_quote

I have seen wizarding culture being far behind muggle culture (still doing arranged marriages for everyone etc.) done well. I also have seen fics where being gay is totally accepted and muggles are looked down upon by wizards for being so intolerant. Both make sense to me, but I think the most realistic is that wizarding culture would mirror muggle culture on this one - there would be uptight purebloods who didn't approve, but accepting loving people like the Weasleys would be cool with it.

#+begin_quote
  What's in his mirror or erised?
#+end_quote

My guess is that 4th year his mirror might have his parents too, just like Harry's. Or maybe his mirror would show him being more confident and fighting in the war/being a war hero - which we know he does at the end of DH. So maybe some cool foreshadowing could happen with this?

#+begin_quote
  I'm considering having them be animaguses; what would Neville's form be?
#+end_quote

I read a fic I loved where Harry's animagus form was a bunny. I also just read one where it was a falcon and both were believable although total opposites - so really you can make anything believable if you explain it well. I think though that Neville's would probably be something loyal, or something really friendly and sweet but that would be violent if threatened. Maybe a dog? Or a donkey - I know that sounds dumb but they are really smart and protect herds from predators. They're also super cute.

So, small quibble here, Neville's boggart is actually snape. Neville riddikukuses it into wearing his grandmother's clothes. This is awesome because of the gryffindors who face their boggart, only two of them (Ron and Neville) have actually faced their worst fear . . . And Neville faces it every day!

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

This is a large part of why I started it; these two should be friends. They have a lot in common. Additionally, Neville is strong in places where harry is weak (knowledge of the magical world ala Ron, for example) and weak where harry is strong. Pureblood networking might be a big help too . . .

  #+begin_quote
    Compared to what? . . . and potentially the ability to have biological kids (if he even cares about that at 14).
  #+end_quote
#+end_quote

So, I was actually thinking from a plot perspective. A lot of fic writers add stuff to the plot w/o taking anything away, which is a surefire road to a super!harry, which isn't something I want. I'm thinking of some things I can trade away to give harry a different skillset than in cannon. I did want to touch on the point of heirs though, because harry is the potter heir and Neville is the longbottom heir so we'll probably need to do something about it (depending on how important we make being an heir to an A&N house-is it just a name? Or is it a wizengamot seat?) But LONG term (whether or not that's in the scope of the fic) Harry definitely will want kids.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

I can't see Harry taking advantage of this, though, can you? Remember the date with Cho in all of its gory details - does Harry make one action in that whole volition through the whole date? And he was such a fence sitter with Ginny until she literally grabbed him. There are points where I'm struggling because I can't imagine either of them making a move that I need them to make and they're both too damn polite.

#+begin_quote
  I think the most realistic is that wizarding culture would mirror muggle culture on this one - there would be uptight purebloods who didn't approve, but accepting loving people like the Weasleys would be cool with it.
#+end_quote

This mirrors my thoughts on it as well. People like dumbledore will always be supportive, people like Umbridge will always be haters. It's the ones in the middle, the fudges and pettigrews and the boneses where you have to pick and choose.

#+begin_quote
  Or a donkey - I know that sounds dumb but they are really smart and protect herds from predators. They're also super cute.
#+end_quote

I agree; I like the donkey idea a lot. I've been lobbying with my SO that Neville should be a hare or a jackrabbit, but she's not buying it. I like the idea of making them both birds, with harry a bird of prey and Neville a Raven or a crow. I'm not sure I want to go that route.

****** I completely forgot about the Snape boggart! Clearly I need to reread the books sometime soon.

Such a good point you made that they are both shy when it comes to relationships and who would make the first move. My thought is you add in some plot device (it could be as small as spin the bottle) to get over that hurdle. Or maybe Neville sees Harry in the mirror of erised? Because you're right that it would be OOC for either of them to just make a move.

Anywho, I'm excited for your fic! If you need a Beta let me know, and/or I'll just be a reader. Def PM me when you post it!

And I agree with you that Harry wouldn't take advantage of Neville-or if he ever did he would never do it again. At the same time, I don't even know if I agree with the characterization of "push-over". It's more that he calculates what the risks are and chooses the least risky one, even if that means being petrified. I would certainly prefer to be petrified than, say, chased down and then beat up, for example.

** You know, I always thought that Neville is incredibly skillful at choosing his battles. He's such a pacifist, but is able to find the courage to fight when he knows it's needed. Otherwise, he seems to rather take on a supporting role. Whereas Harry is much more hot-headed and eager to get into the fray of battles (especially in his 5th year). I think it would be interesting to see Neville teach Harry how to take a step back and look at the bigger picture and /then/ act on his emotions. Just an added calmness to Harry's character could drastically change several major moments in the canon series. Neville could learn how to gain more confidence in displaying his negative emotions while with Harry. Fear, sadness, anger- he is very nervous about expressing feelings that don't align with his grandmother's idea of a perfect wizard. Harry doesn't know how to handle his own negative emotions well, but he certainly isn't afraid to openly show them. So, they can learn together how to be sad healthily?

*Edit to add:* Neville's animal could be a bear. Here's a bit about their temperment:

#+begin_quote
  They are NOT mean or malicious. Bears are normally shy, retiring animals that have very little desire to interact with humans. Unless they are forced to be around humans to be near a food source, they usually choose to avoid us.

  Bears, like humans and other animals, have a “critical space” -- an area around them that they may defend. Once you have entered a bear's critical space, you have forced the bear to act -- either to run away or be aggressive.

*** I know! The deeper I go down this rabbit hole, the better a match it appears. Harry is reckless and daring, Neville is shy and thoughtful. Harry was raised by muggles, Neville's a pureblood. Neville knows and is friends with Harry, and certainly isn't intimidated by him directly (because we all know how intimidating Harry is when he's angry) nor is he intimidated by Harry's public persona. If Harry doesn't want to go to the Dursleys anymore, I bet even Dumbledore can't intimidate Augusta Longbottom. They're opposite but complementary, which gives them each a place to shine, rather than having Harry/extra person who is there for Harry to stare at lovingly.

As far as the Bear form, Neville has a bear form patronus in several fics where we "fix" him and his nervousness. The one that springs to mind is linkffn(harry potter and the prince of slytherin), but I'm certain it was done in a time travel redo fic too. Maybe Nightmares of Futures past, or something like it. So it's definitely under consideration! My SO wants him to be a hedgehog . . .

Neville is the Herbology professor, naturally, and Percy is headmaster of Hogwarts. It's a charming story, short on plot but long on sweet nature and good humor, and it's very well-written.
