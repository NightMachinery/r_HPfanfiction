I read something interesting with a brief Percy POV recently and he's always been my favourite Weasley after Ginny so I'm looking for any fics that are about Percy or are from his perspective? I'd prefer no romance but I like Percy/Oliver. anything is good but kudos if it's long and interesting. canon divergence / au is fine!


** Linkffn(Order of Mercy) is excellent and Percy has a pretty large role.

** Lately I have been loving linkffn(Percy take the wheel by kitty smith). It has such an amazing Percy. Also you said no romance but I'd still recommend linkffn(proving them wrong by griffinsky) which tells the story of what Percy was up to during the war, including meeting Audrey. And lastly, linkffn(Harry Potter without Harry Potter by slytherinim) has an awesome Percy, though he's not the absolute focus of the story. There are a lot of main characters and he is one of them.

#+begin_quote
  A freak accident with Arthur's enchanted Ford Anglia causes a minor explosion and a major change in the Weasley household. With Arthur in a coma and Molly having passed away, Bill and Charlie can't afford to quit their jobs and must support the family from afar. Thus, it falls to Percy to handle the day-to-day, even if he's not sure that he can.

  What are you going to do?" she asked softly. "I'm going to fight back." Percy replied calmly. What Percy was really up to during Deathly Hallows. Teaming up with some unlikely allies, he tries to bring the persecuted to freedom... and stay alive.

  Suppose Tom Riddle never bothers to show mercy, and Harry Potter dies with his parents? What would that mean for the world, to have no Boy-Who-Lived to save them? ("A couple of stubborn kids" just doesn't have the same ring to it.)
