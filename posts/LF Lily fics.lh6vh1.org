I'm looking for fics in which Lily survives the events of Halloween of ‘81 alongside Harry and proceeds to be a good, loving to Harry. I'd also like stories where she eventually moves on and meets someone new. That person can be a man or a woman.

  "The sorrow birds find what is weak, my chest, beak-marked, my eyes long gone." - Ann V. DevilbissLily Potter is dead.No.Lily Potter should be dead.The cheerful little owl clock on top of the dresser hesitates, then ticks onward. The baby in the crib sucks in another eager breath, and wails anew. The dead girl on the floor- the should be dead girl on the floor- opens her eyes.(Lily lives, but sometimes wishes she hadn't.)
