** If you're good with slash then I definitely recommend linkffn(Rebirth) don't judge until you read some, it's about Harry being Voldemort's lover reincarnated through necromancy and it is unbelievably sad however it is very good and one of the best for the pairing

Otherwise I just read linkffn(Honour Thy Blood) and it was a fantastic Harry centric fic

  Bereft of purpose after the loss of his powers, a now sixteen year old Ichigo Kurosaki decided that a change of venue would be what he needed to get him out of his funk. A surprise win with a scholarship opens the door to a new world and not the one he was expecting. (Set after the Aizen Arc but before the fullbring arc.)

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.
