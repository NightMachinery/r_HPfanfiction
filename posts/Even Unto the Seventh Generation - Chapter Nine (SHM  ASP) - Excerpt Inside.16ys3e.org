** EXCERPT: "This week has been a disaster!" Albus heard Molly's voice long before he sat down under their favorite willow tree. "When they elect a new Minister, it could be another twenty years before he retires. And what if it's a woman? I want to be the first woman in office since Millicent Bagnold!"

"Can't you think of anything but politics, Molly?" Rose twirled a wildflower between her fingertips. Nearby, Louis examined a willow branch.

"It's not like you had the worst of it, you know," he said under his breath. Crack! He snapped the stick in two. Both Rose and Albus scooted back. There was no avoiding the tirade now.
