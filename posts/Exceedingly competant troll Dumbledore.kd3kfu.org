Any fics where Dumbledore is extremely competant at dealing with threats, but is either insane or an unrepentant troll in his derailing of them.

​

Maybe he turns up just in time to stop a fight, then just stands there silently eating popcorn while everybody gets more uncomfortable at the scrutiny. Maybe it gets to the drawing of the names in GoF and Harry Potter's name doesn't come out, being replaced with Tom Riddle or Barty Crouch Jr, while Dumbledore smiles serenely at the chaos this has caused.

  After defeating the basilisk, Harry is expelled for his efforts. Dumbledore was unable to get his job back as Headmaster. The two set off on a trip together around the world, where Harry will discover the benefits of being the only student of a brilliant former Headmaster who no longer feels the need to avoid sharing information.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

In my version manipulative Dumbledore is on full display useing his prestige,a time turner, & reputation to shape the wizarding world to be sillier. Deeds I'd attribute to Dumbledore include giving Fudge his green bolwer hat (right off his own head), designing the Wizengamot robes, hacking the Hogwarts wards & changing the school song.

******** Oh it doesn't. Bashing can be a way to just scratch an itch for a character you may dislike. I personally see Albus as a manipulator, but for good reasons. I feel like he lost touch a little bit there, and started to see the future as a whole instead of the strokes that make it, and I can definitely see an Albus who strongly opposes changes to his plans to an unhealthy degree. Sadly, that's what was probably needed at the time. It doesn't mean I like it. I can enjoy a good Albus bashing story, but only for his canon actions. I'm fine with exaggerations to a point, but if you're gonna bash a character, do it right. You know.

  What he had pictured in his head when he'd first thought of teaching were long, sweeping orations, students hanging on his every word, young minds being taken in and inspired by his message. What he did not fully consider, however, was that he would actually have to teach. (In which Tom Riddle begins teaching at Hogwarts and realizes just what a horribly stupid idea it was.)

  The houses of Hogwarts are growing stagnant, and a certain sentient Hat is dismayed over this turn of events. It decides to take matters into its own hands, taking advantage of several obscure rules to sort students where the Hat wants them, not where heredity or their own desires want them to be. The result? A mess that gradually pulls the student body into utter chaos.
