"Just because you have the emotional range of a teaspoon--!"

If anything, I would think it'd be more likely that Ron would be more socially aware and tactful. Ron has a large family, and even if he isn't exactly like them, Bill and Charlie (and by extension, his parents) could have instilled a great sense of awareness and sociability to him. I'd imagine having a large family requires a person to be able to read people well (not always, but generally).

Now, we don't know about Hermione's home-life, except that she was a loner before Hogwarts with no siblings. Perhaps, her childhood involved a dissonance between herself and other "average" students; why don't they get the work? It's so simple! etc. And maybe, what she views as logical and well-intentioned advice doesn't necessarily work in the situation, e.g. Lavender's pet rabbit.

Therefore, it feel as though it would fit better if /Hermione/ was the one with "the emotional range of a teaspoon", while Ron is the (generally) more tactful person.

Can't solve a 1000-year-old riddle? Hermione

Offers the best advice to interact with Cho? Ron

Additionally, it sets a nice dynamic between the two; Ron -- who isn't dumb, by any means -- learns how to apply his mind with logic. Meanwhile, Hermione learns how to empathise.

What do you think?


** I think they're both tactless, but in very different ways. Ron is the usual I'm-a-teenager way. He has poor impulse control, lacks sensitivity, and gets so preoccupied that he forgts other people's feelings - so, in other words, like a regular teenager with a still-developing frontal lobe and a lack of experience. While he can't reason out how people feel, his interactions with others are also very intuitive, and he hits the right buttons most of the time. He has a reasonable wide social circle, so he knows what common interests are and how to talk about them. He is easy-going and it makes him easy to talk to despite how he blunders sometimes.

Hermione on the other hand is the kind of socially awkward that comes from being extremely poorly socialized. As you pointed out, she was an only child who was likely not only a loner by choice but was also socially ostracized for being different. This means that she can look at a situation and reason out people's feeling. She's good at reading the room - from the outside. But when you put her in a situation with actual people, she flounders. She grew up isolated enough that she doesn't have a natural sense for other people's interest, and her priorities are so different that she often doesn't have a common ground with most of her peers anyway.

Anyway, I suppose my point is that I agree with you for the most part. Ron has a very intuitive sense of people that Hermione does not because he has been /exposed/ to a lot of people. Hermione on the other hand has been outside of social circles most of her life, and that informs how she interacts (or fails to) with others as well.

*** What you say make sense. Hermione was a person able to give reasonably good love adviceto people (still not totally convinced about the "try to see other people" to Ginny, but it helped Ginny to see Harry as a human and not the "Boy Who Lived" and kinda worked out in the end), yet at the same time she was just terrible when handling her own love life (pretty much everything she did in HBP).

*** I think Ron is more personable in 'normal' situations - but he's /very/ oblivious when things get a bit more serious or when it comes to romance (it appears to me that JKR just went with the trope-y way of treating teens, where the boys are clueless about girls).

For Hermione, she's a mix. She can be very careful/understanding about others' feelings - moreso than Ron when it comes to something darker. However, she also gets very swept up in things, particularly arguments or of things that she /knows/ is wrong, and that can cut off her empathy.

For instance, in GoF Hermione is much more aware of how Neville and Harry feel after Fake Moody's class on the Unforgivables - and that's a pretty easy thing to see. On the flip side, we can see her reaction to Lavender's rabbit's death in the previous book - due to Hermione being rather invested into the 'academic' side of denigrating Divination, she goes into argumentation mode - instead of stopping to think about how the rabbit's death has hurt Lavender.

**** Agreed. Ron is precisely the well-adjusted kid who had the normal amount of socialization and therefore the normal amount of astuteness. He is friendly and fun in the ways normally socialized people are. H knows what the right games are and what boys his age are doing and he can keep up conversations about those things. He doesn't have the sense for the more complex stuff though. It's not in his radar because he hadn't had the need to spot the truly distressing stuff.

Hermione has two settings, extremely sensitive to distress and extremely invested in being right. My current theory is that Hermione has a long history of being bullied and rejected, and both settings are the result of that. She understands distress. She knows loneliness and injustice. That makes her extremely sensitive to people who are experiencing similar hardships (eg. Neville), and she responds accordingly. Usually, that means either solving the problem or finding the right thing to say.

On the other hand, chances are she responded to the bullying by doubling down in her academics. The mindset is usually like this: "It doesn't matter if they hate me if at the end of the day I'm right". Being right is a huge part of her identity and self-esteem, so when that's threatened, she gets aggressive and attacks first. This is usually when her (disastrous) faux pas happens. She is so busy defending herself that she forgets her usual kindness.

** Well, you have my vote.

It would be interesting to see an AU that goes ahead and puts Hermione on the Asperger/Autism spectrum, along the lines of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saga_Nor%C3%A9n][Saga Norén]] or [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperance_%22Bones%22_Brennan][Temperance "Bones" Brennan]]. Imagine, for example, her finding out that Harry's parents were murdered and "comforting" him by quoting statistics about how /most/ orphans still end up OK or remarking how Harry appears to be reasonably well-adjusted ordinarily, as well as how his parents' death does not appear to have affected him that much. Or, if Harry is dating someone, she remarks that given his abusive upbringing, he might want to avoid having children as he is at an increased risk of perpetuating the cycle of violence. Done right, it could make for some neat [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cringe_comedy][cringe comedy]].

With magic in the equation, it might be fun to have her abuse magic to compensate. For example,

- Unfortunately, she can't read people's emotions.
- Fortunately, there's Legilimency, so she works very hard to master eye-contact Legilimency.
- Unfortunately, she sometimes mixes things up and ends up replying to people's thoughts rather than to their words.
- Fortunately, Memory Charms can be used to fix the bigger social gaffes.
- Unfortunately, if there is more than one person present, she needs to somehow Obliviate multiple people quckly.
- Fortunately, there are some spells with an area of effect that she can use.

It escalates from there.

There is a risk of ending in a [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisabilitySuperpower][Disability Superpower]] territory, though.

My main problem with Hermione in most fanfictions is her 'mary-sue' ness, rarely having any 'negative' traits that balance out her personality (Although that might be because of my reading preference, as again, I tend to avoid fanfictions where she is a prominent character, or is just a canon rehash.)

*** I would like to see this. Others in this thread have written about their own experiences with autism and i'll add my two pence. The disability superpower trope can be easily avoided if you remember that it is, in fact, still a disability. Yeah you learn to live with it and adapt to cope, but its still much more of a hindrance than a help. Paradoxically I wouldn't change that though as it can give you a semi-unique perspective on life.

Canon Hermione always resonated with me in a way. My brand of Asperger's wasn't Savant Syndrome, which is quite rare, but I am Higher functioning and above average, very bookish like Hermione. I thought canon Hermione was Smart but she wasn't necessarily a genius, she absorbs and regurgitates esoteric information. This is similar to special interests.

**** The fundamental problem is what to actually /do/ with Hermione on the spectrum.

There is no point to the premise unless we see a lot of social (and antisocial) interactions involving Hermione, which means that the fic has to be fairly Hermione-centric.

But then, one needs to figure out how this Hermione fits into the things happening in canon. Now, one can get rid of Voldemort and make it slice-of-life or romance without real conflict---in which characters' actions have no real consequences for anyone but themselves and their immediate social circle---but I, for one, find that uninteresting.

Hermione's canon story is about coming into a new world, learning about it, and then /changing/ it to comport with her values. If that's lost, then what's the point of Hermione? Why not some random Ravenclaw?

OK, so suppose that Hermione remains involved. In fact, one probably /could/ rehash the canon plot with Hermione having Asperger's: her social skills and intuition are not particularly plot-critical. But, again, a rehash is a rehash; what's the point?

So, things ought to deviate from canon. That means that Hermione's actions need to have consequences, which means that she needs to have agency despite certain things people tend to take for granted now being far more difficult for her.

Here, my own biases come in. The spectrum of agency a character can have runs, loosely, from Damsel, to Chorus, to Sidekick, to Hero(ine), to Villain(ess). I, for one, would rather err on the side of "Villainess" than on the side of "Damsel". Hence my idea of her mastering magic that compensates for some aspects of her condition but not quite, while creating additional problems, pitfalls, danger, and conflict.

** Hermione actually /was/ tactless in the early books.

This was one of the cases where JKR was influenced by the movies' portrayal of the characters while she was still writing, I believe.

You can see she veered off course with Ron and Hermione by the fact we know that she likes to seed things in advance and yet Ron's mirror of Erised vision never really comes to pass, while also Ron's tactical skill which got them to the Stone in the first book also gets dropped like a hot potato.

Although tbh part of that is probably her difficulty in thinking up plots where Ron's skills /would/ actually be more of use than Hermione's, after stacking the deck in Hermione's favour by situating most of the plots in her home turf, the education system, where a key part is being able to interact with adults in a mature way.

*** In my opinion, because of that influence, the movies ruined the books a little bit. I mean, it affected the way she wrote almost all the major characters, and she became ambiguous about things like Harry's height.

Ron grew up in the wizarding world; Harry and Hermione didn't. This is where his knowledge and experience could get some space, but it didn't get that much, because all that was attributed to Hermione, even more so in the movies than the books.

**** Agreed, for sure. I would go as far to say that the movies suffered from casting Emma Watson too because as she grew to be the best actor of the three, I imagine it became very tempting to give her more and more plot prominence - a vicious cycle.

I think Ron also suffered from Fred and George's later narrative prominence in the books - it comes across a little like JKR writing book 1 wanted a likeable everyman among a family of stars, but grew to become more interested in writing about the stars herself. Once again, as we've seen over the last few years, JKR's weakness as a writer is to write what she likes, rather than building on the foundations she laid at all times.

I'm going to stretch a bit here and think that all of the teachers thought of Hermione like that a few times but it was Snape who was childish enough to actually verbalize it.

It's also there when she tries to drive logic into people, to the point where she isn't aware that it probably isn't the right time to say such things, for example, when Lavender's pet rabbit died. Hermione's right that it couldn't have been the Trelawney's prediction coming true but it wasn't the right time to argue with someone who just received bad news and was grieving. I know it's just a pet but I do get sad when my pets die so I sympathize with Lavender here.

** Not sure if I agree with this take or disagree with it. On the one hand, yes, I think it makes more sense for Hermione to be tactless, rather than Ron. On the other hand, I kinda think this is how the books are already written, for the most part?

The most glaring example is, like, all of PoA, in which Hermione 1) can't seem to figure out why Ron is upset that his pet got killed, and 2) can't seem to figure out why Harry was upset about the way she handled the firebolt. The latter is of course an example of personal courage and caring for your friends (good things!), but her lack of emotional intelligence (and Harry's lack of objectivity) also led to the whole thing being a thoroughly unnecessary blowout fight.

We also see throughout the series that Harry and Hermione basically only have each other and Ron, but that Ron is well liked and has decent friendships with a wide group of people. There are several times when one of Harry/Ron/Hermione has a big fight with the other two, and Ron is the only one in these circumstances who seems to be able to just... go hang out with other people.

I mean, obviously this isn't a scenario where one of them is better in every social situation than the other. As another commenter pointed out, Hermione is pretty good at analyzing situations she's not a part of, whereas Ron has much better interpersonal instincts. But on the whole, I think canon!Ron is portrayed as quite a bit more charismatic and just a tad less tactless than canon!Hermione is.

He talks about Quidditch with Harry and other people. Ron has both the social skills and the grasp on social conventions to make quite a lot of friends.

Something I find interesting is that as much as Ron is called out or being tactless, his tactlessness actually has much smaller social consequences than Hermione's own bouts. Yeah, he annoyed Harry's potential girlfriend, but Hermione got her ostracized from Harry and Ron (eg. 3rd Year). I'm not sure if this is due to the tactlessness itself or if it's because Hermione has a much smaller social cushion than Ron, but it is interesting to think about.

Of course he won't have a Cassanova's ability with women. But it also doesn't make either her tactful, or him a person with the emotional range of a teaspoon. It was simply an insult because he hurt her feelings. Feelings that she too was hiding from the boy she had a crush on.

If everyone here remembers their teenage years without the benefit of rose tinted glasses, they'll remember that they too were emotionally anxious and prone to slamming their foot in their mouth.

This is what happened according old JKR interviews

#+begin_quote
  Two years after Ron became an Auror he left the job, stating that he wanted to help his brother George with a shop he had always loved. Already a highly successful emporium, together they were able to turn Weasley's Wizard Wheezes into an even more gigantic money-spinner.
#+end_quote

--------------

#+begin_quote
  Hermione attained a high position in the Ministry of Magic, first through the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures. There, she continued her work with S.P.E.W., working for the rights of underprivileged non-humans such as house-elves. She then went on to become Deputy Headof the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, and assisted the Minister for Magic Kingsley Shacklebolt in eradicating the old laws biased in favour of pure-bloods.

And I think Hermione becoming MoM came from Cursed Child (yeaah, that's basically fanfiction)

** I think it's kind of shallow to assume that if a person is a loner/don't have great family etc., then they will be tactless. I think that empathy and an ability to put yourself in someone shoes etc. are things that are quite distinct from being sociable and outgoing etc. Maybe I say that because I am myself an introvert, I was quite lonely when I was growing up and has been considered a swot and a bookworm. My parents were a bit poor, not that I really lacked anything, but my house looked awful and I was wearing ugly clothes and didn't go anywhere, and my parents didn't fit in and didn't have much freinds themselves.

I mean, in my early years, I was a lot like Hermione, apart from the fact, that no mountain troll attacked me in the bathroom and I hadn't formed and valuable friendship until late high school/studies.

And I don't think it meant that I was tactelss or lacked emapthy. Yes, I was akward. Yes, I was weird and didn't look dress or groom myself like girls in my class. Yes, I was lost in a weird social dynamic when girls were gossiping, arguing, coming to me when they were angry with their real friend, and then abandoning me, when they made up. But I tried to helped people with schoolwork, even trying to put in effort to really explain something to them, when they just wanted to copy homework. I was almost never really mean to someone, called them names, gossip about them, or make fun of them. Okay, I wasn't a saint, maybe I did make fun of a name of the neigbhour once, which was the word, that was really old and not used anymore, but basically meant a simpleton. But they were really mean to me before.

And for example, I have a friend, who is way more outgoing than me, he is great at presentations, he has a lot of acquintances, he parties, but he can be quite coarse and insenstitive.

And to stop talking about me, because I feel like I sound a bit like a pity party.

I don't think Hermione was a faultless character and that she hadn't been sometimes arrogant, quick to anger or too self-righteous. But I think that when it comes to empathy and emotions, I don't think she was lacking. She always cared about those who were in trouble, who needed help, who were outcasts. Remember, how she wanted to help Neville, when others didn't care and made fun of him. Or she helped Hagrid with the hypogriff. Or she discovered that Remus Lupin was a werewolf, but judged him as his own person and kept his secret. Or how she took care of Crookshanks, even though nobody else wanted him, and she recognised what an intelligent creature he was. Or how she wanted to help house elves. Which was made sound, like she was crazy and had some SJW complex, but I don't see it like that; when you are enslaved for too long and brought up to believe your only purpose is to please your master, it can be unimaginable to get out of your cage. So, IMO Hermione was right, even though she maybe didn't get to helping house elves best way, but she was just a teenage girl.

In fact, I think being an outcast, being bullied often increases your compassion and empathy. Not always of course, they are people who grow bitter and then hate on everyone.

On the other hand, I don't think that having a huge family has to increase your consideration for others. Actually, it can create an environment of competition, as it was actually shown in Ron's example. It may happen that siblings fight among themselves, and so they sort of toughen up, because for them, it's not important: they fight, they are mean to each other, but in the end they make up, they are family, bigger conflicts will be handled by their parents. So they could behave like that then in school, and thinks, it's not a big deal, because they're used to it. But when it was a playfight, it was in a controlled environment of people who loved each other. Whereas, when a person who feels alone or is insecure is made fun of, they might not take it lightly. Like, a lot of people don't mind when friends play jokes on them, if they have a close relationship and they accept themselves and things that are unusual about them. But sometimes when someone makes fun of the trait or feature you are insecure about, it's hurtful.

So, my point is, that Hermione might have been socially awkard, may not have had great social skills, but it doesn't mean she isn't emotionally sensitive to other people. And the fact that Ron has had a more social life, has a big family, doesn't mean that he is tactful. Ron shows in the books a few examples, when he was inconsiderate ot not in touch with emotions of the others, even close ones. For example, when he said awful things about Hermione after Wingardium Leviosa thing. Yeah, they both kind of screwed up, but Hermione still just wanted to help. She corrected Ron, because he said it wrong over and over again. He was immediately rude to her, and then he was just bitter that she could do it, but not him. It was his own problem, and he took it out on her.

Or when there is this Yule Ball think and he bascially treats Hermione like she isn't a girl and doesn't exist, and then is super shocked that Victor Krum would go out with her.

This isn't to trash Ron, he might be a little crude sometimes, but his heart is in the right place and he loves his friends fiercely. He also grows a lot during the series. And as I said, Hermione can sometimes be too self-righteous and bossy, she's not a saint. But I think that she is actually quite sensitive to emotions of others and usually more tactful than Ron, more often goes out of her way to think about the others. Oh, another example is Victor Krum, who was perceived by everyone just as a celebrity and god and a sports star, which was quite shallow, while Hermione treated him like a person.

** I mean she kinda is? Like Ron is too for sure and Ron's are more memorable because of the emotional impact. But Hermione has more tactless moments overall but it like just little things.

Like for example telling Lavender she is wrong bout Trawleny being a seer when she's mourning her rabbit. She doesn't want Lavender to get caught up in the Trawleny is right mentality get led on. But doesn't consider the situation when saying it.

Or another example saying the quibbler is rubbish to Luna. Sure she didn't know her father was the editor but she knew Luna read it and I don't think she was trying to be insulting or condesend by saying this comment.

Or when she reports the fireboldt to a teacher because Sirius Black without even trying to discuss with her friend first.

Loads of other situations like this but most dont leave huge impact in the narrative or on Harry. So Ron seems more tactless but I think he actually has fewer moments like this compared to Hermione

** You can make the opposite argument.

In a large family, you have to shout to be heard. If you're always trying to be tactful, you'll get rolled over and ignored.

Being an only child and not having friends, you spend much more time focusing on what other people want and how to interact with them in an effort to get people to like you.

Hermione /did/ lack social awareness when she arrived at Hogwarts. Her early interactions with Harry and Ron were terrible - /"no wonder she hasn't got any friends"/. But when she did eventually make friends, she had both the opportunity for sociability /and/ the experience of rejection from her many years of friendlessness, which motivated her to continue putting in extra effort to understand the feelings of others.

Ron learned being loud and tactless worked in his family environment, then did the same thing at Hogwarts and ended up with /Harry Freaking Potter/ as his best friend within hours. It caused friction with Hermione, but she ended up falling in love with him anyway.

** Ronniekins and Gin-Gin would have been coddled (to an extent) by their mother. Anyone who's grown up with younger siblings will know how they kind of get pampered/get a little special treatment. Mrs Weasley would have been protective, particularly of Ron, what with the twins turning his teddy bear into a spider, getting him to almost make an Unbreakable Vow and god knows what else. A large family would have contributed to his sense of empathy and emotional awareness, but a protective mother would have also stunted it to an extent. The soil is just as important as water for a tree to grow.

Harry and Hermione both grow up as loners until they get to Hogwarts. It would have compelled them to not take friendly people for granted like Ron who's simply used to a large number of people existing and being communicative with him.
