** Per JKR, canonically there are 11 permanent magical schools, with the majority of the global wizarding population being either home schooled, schooled in their local community, or attending transient schools. There may also be a system of apprenticeship.

You can easily imagine how these transient schools might appear or disappear: someone home-schools their own child, then teaches a friend's child as a favour, then word spreads and more families send their children to this teacher. Over time they may gather around them other teachers and relocate to a school building rather than using their own home.

But then something occurs to disrupt the school's operations. Maybe the originator retires or dies. Maybe there's no more magical kids in the local area to school, because the wizarding population there is very sparse. Perhaps there's a scandal. Whatever happens, the school lacks the institutional momentum to survive the disruption, going into decline and finally dissolving rather than becoming a permanent institution.

It's similar to how small businesses come and go in the real world. Even very successful small businesses often fail to survive the loss of a key individual or a change in their market.

In general, I am quite a big fan of this approach to magical schooling in canon. It reflects the historical educational norm, before universal education became a thing in the late 1800s. It means that each school can have a significant mythology attached to it which makes it feel special, something that you couldn't do if there were hundreds of magical schools. It means that the 11 schools become like the Oxbridge of the wizarding world - not the only way of learning about magic, but in a separate tier to everyone else.

The last one also has the benefit of creating a significant level of magical inequality between wizards from the great schools and those who were schooled more informally, where most wizards would possess quite specialised knowledge, and it would only be those who attended the great schools who had access to the full range of e.g. Charms, Transfiguration, Potions.

Another benefit to all this is that it means that Britain is an international outlier in terms of the percentage of its magical population which receives a formal magical education. This in turn nicely fits into why Britain seems to have an outsized influence on the magical world, from the fact that Dumbledore and Voldemort were both British, to the way that the timing of global international events seems to coincide with significant moments in British history (such as the Statute of Secrecy coinciding with the British Bill of Rights).

However, I do feel that 11 schools is slightly too low. In Victoria Potter I have changed the number of permanent schools from 11 to 13. I felt this was necessary to cover the major regions of the world as well as locations which I felt had sufficient mythology to deserve a magic school.

Here are my ideas:

- Brazil - Castelobruxo - Amazon Rainforest

- China - Xifang Xuexiao ("School of the West") - Jade Mountain (Chinese/Tibetan Himalayas)

- Egypt - Wadi Al Mujawis ("Valley of the Magi") - Theban Necropolis

- France - Beauxbatons - Pyrennes

- Great Britain - Hogwarts Castle - Scottish Highlands

- India - Suvaloka - Mount Meru (Indian Himalayas)

- Japan - Mahoutokoro - Minami Iwo Jima

- Persia - Alcaraz Palace - Badab-e Surt

- Peru - El Dorado - Peruvian Altiplano

- Russia - Koldovstoretz - Mount Elbrus

- Norway - Durmstrang - Svalbard

- Uganda - Uagadou - Mountains of the Moon

- USA - Ilvermorny - Mount Greylock, Massachusetts

I like the idea that the Indian and Chinese schools have an intense rivalry, a result not only of their close geographical proximity, but also because they have overlapping and contradictory founding myths (Jade Mountain, the residence of the Queen Mother of the West, is supposed to be part of the mythical Kunlun Mountains, the Chinese version of Mount Meru).

For all of these schools I have followed the canon convention of magical schools being located in the middle of nowhere, far from Muggle civilisation. It also tickles me that there will be huge parts of the world where there's no magical school at all, and then two very large ones very close together in the Himalayas.

*** I'd like to think Australasia/Oceania has a school somewhere - its population is concentrated in specific areas for the most part, leaving a landscape of "dense cities with a lot of middle-of-nowhere to go around" - too large of a community to get by on transient schools/homeschooling alone, plenty of effectively-empty space to put said school in.

Other than that particular omission, I wholeheartedly agree with your assessment.

***** That's where we'll have to agree-to-disagree, which is effectively the default state of headcanon - I see it as a relatively 'young' community, true, but just large and old enough for a small but centralized school of magic to exist.

The idea would have been seeded /during/ the colonization, as a way for the sparse native magic-users to get together and teach their ways to the newcomers and the future generations. This idea would have come forth /because/ of what happened the last time a colonization happened, in America - they'd have a desire not to start with the same animosity.

It wouldn't necessarily be a large or venerable institution given the Australian colonization is a relatively recent event, but the above list only mentions "permanent" as a requirement for being on the list - and that's the one thing it would be.

In my headcanon, before the American colonization, each of the ancient Middle/South-American civilizations would have transient schools, with /maybe/ a few larger ones near the larger settlements. Those transient schools consolidated to the one in Brazil when the colonists arrived and started threatening their way of life.

In modern times, the students in Mexico/Southern-US would be split between Ilvermorny teaching a mostly-European curriculum, and the school in Brazil teaching a method that evolved from those civilizations. The animosity at the founding of Ilvermorny would lead to tense relations throughout the history of the two schools.

  If that was their goal they weren't very successful, because the Aus aboriginal population went about the same way as the native American one.
#+end_quote

On the Muggle side, yes. On the Wizard side, probably not actually - as you yourself said, wizards live longer. Some of them would live during both colonizations, and would most likely float the idea around of "let's actually learn from the natives this time and not just immediately piss them off like we did last time".

#+begin_quote
  You also didn't touch on the issue of population. If modern UK (pop 60M) produces a school of 300, 1900s Australia (pop 4M) would produce a school of ...20? Three students in each year.
#+end_quote

Friendly reminder that Ilvermorny canonically started out as a literal shack with like 3 students total, and yet by 1920 not only did it still exist, it was basically the only Wizarding school for the entire US. I don't exactly think the initial size of the school matters here in terms of staying-power.

#+begin_quote
  When you further consider thatwizards live longer
#+end_quote

... But they /mature/ at the same age and have children at around the same ages. For the formation of a school I think that's an important distinction to make.

** Mahoutokoro: rigorous school, with a high emphasis on mundane subjects (esp science & tech). Best enchanting program on the planet, and a technomancy elective. Grants a high number of Masteries.

Significant number of Veela in the student body, along with a significant percentage of what in Britain would be referred to as half-breeds if not outright Creatures. Does not in fact have the smallest student body, just the smallest /maximum/ student body for 11-17 year olds. Although the school argued at the last ICW ranking that Hogwarts claimed numbers are the "ridiculous ramblings of a Math illiterate."

** Beauxbatons: modern, artsy-fartsy, egalitarian, "sunny" (warm climate)

Durmstrang: grey, dimly lit, dark arts, quiet

Ilvermorny: militaristic, authoritarian, enormous

Those are the only ones I've ever considered.

** Beauxbâtons was a Christian bastion in the Pyrenees during the Reconquista before it was designed to be a school of magic by Charlemagne. The Christian reputation stayed as the Reconquista continued and as more Iberian lands were liberated, the more people from Iberia went there. Italian students started going there later when the Roman school began to much the Holy See's lap dog. The entirety of the Pyrenees is under the jurisdiction of the Andorran Ministry, including the valley where Beauxbâtons and its neighbouring village is. Although, if the village is part of magical Andorra, the school is completely independent from any government, wizarding or otherwise.

** I base the wandless magic taught at Uagadou (in style) off of the magic portrayed in The Magicians. Spells need to be cast with purpose and depend on many Circumstances which affect the spell components (verbal and gestures) in major and minor ways, from star positions, to the phase of the moon, to altitude, etc. IMO it makes sense given Uagadou's famous skill in Astronomy.

Going with this idea, wands would minimize the impact of Circumstances, allowing for better standardization of magic study.

I also strongly disagree with the main way I've seen Durmstrang's Dark Arts class being portrayed (as a dueling/combat oriented class). The dark arts "are many, varied, ever-changing, and eternal", it's an interdisciplinary field of study that's a lot more esoteric, with most truly dark books describing things through euphemism and symbology, and students having to learn to read between the lines, to deduce and discover kernels of knowledge from scraps of information.

Large countries (USA, Brazil, Russia) have some very reputable transient schools. They aren't as old the the main 11, being 200 years old at the most, they aren't as large (topping at 100-150 students), and they are only nationally accredited instead of internationally.

Tbh, as a Brazillian, I find what little we know from Castelobruxo to be very underwhelming and if I'm thinking up an AU it's the first school to go. Going with a canon-compliant scenario, I imagine there are at least 5 small-to-moderate sized transient schools (1 for each region).
