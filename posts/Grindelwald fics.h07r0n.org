** Here are some I liked but I warn you I'm really fond of Grindeldore.

This one has a really interesting timeline. It's in the 30s of previous century but with the Golden Trio and Marauders. Tom Riddle is working with Hitler but he hasn't become Voldemort yet although it seems he's going to be main antagonist anyway: linkao3(20377591)

  Gilderoy Lockhart landed himself in St Mungo's after his 'Cornish Pixies' class. Where can a headmaster now find another Defence teacher, one who's knowledgeable beyond doubt, willing to face the curse on the position, and available to start in a few days? In Nurmengard, that's where.

  Thirty years after his imprisonment, Grindelwald escapes.Authorities are busy worrying about him, but Albus Dumbledore knows that whoever managed to break him out of prison surely is about to become a menace to the world.

  Albus Dumbledore has to attend a disciplinary hearing for withholding invaluable information about Gellert Grindelwald, deliberate misdirection and performing a blood pact with the person who currently represents the biggest threat to the wizard community.Unknowingly, he takes Veritaserum before.

  Harry Potter, weathered wizarding warrior in his mid-twenties, finds himself in 1940. Albus is coming up with a theory, and an adolescent Tom Riddle, torn between feeling threatened and piqued, acquires a controversial mentor. Hallows, spell-making, horror, politics and witty banter, served with a Grindledore sidedish. Slow and slightly disturbing TR/HP. First chapters re-polished.

  Two Dementors showed up in Little Whinging and changed Harry Potter's world forever. Now he's on the hunt for family he's never known plus entangled in a web of political intrigue and subterfuge. Why does everything happen to him?

  AU. With Albus dead, there's only one wizard left to continue his fight. His oldest friend. His true love. There's no better choice for defeating a Dark Lord bent on murdering all muggleborns than the one wizard who gathered them under his banner once before. True, things went a little out of hand, but Gellert Grindelwald has changed. If only everyone else would realise this...

  Today had to be the worst day of Dumbledores life. The Potters are dead, Harry is with the Dursleys and his sister Iris had to be brought to an orphanage. But to top that off: Gellert Grindelwald escaped his imprisonment. What will happen to the boy-who-lived? Who will reach him first? Forces of darkness are lingering in the shadows. Harry is the son of Grindelwald.
