** I think there is a lot of potential even for epilogue compliant fics. All the epilogue really tells us is the trio's family lives 19 years on. The war crimes and aftermath is likely to have been resolved two decades on- "All was well" does not necessarily kick in immediately after book 7.

** Honestly, I don't see why the epilogue gets so much focus and hate. I'm personally rather ambivalent to the future it presents, but even if you don't it's just two self-contained pages that you can easily completely ignore if you so desire.

I've personally seen some absolutely amazing fics that milk the epilogue for everything it's worth and some equally great fics that go completely off the rails and lead to a completely different ending.

I just don't really care. If a fic is good it's good, regardless of how closely it follows the epilogue (or canon in general.)

Hermione wants Ron very enthusiastically and it's still a terrible partner for her. Of course characters are going to be romantically interested in their intended partners and not someone else (unless the author is some kind of masochist).

For example, it turned Ron into someone who casually attacks Muggles with mind magic, the epilouge pretends that the earlier war crimes did not happen and implies that a war has no consequences ("all was well").

Also with the exception of Rose, pretty much all names of the next Gen kids are atrocious Fred II, Albus Severus and Hugo are the worst, but the other's aren't great either.

Someone ELSE naming their son after Fred Weasley would be a bit strange, but for George it's just because he loved his twin brother. So did Angelina, come to that - she played Quidditch with and liked both twins, so I can't imagine her being upset that George would suggest naming their kid after someone she *also* cared about.

About the number thing...little Fred isn't "Fred II" in-universe. He's just Fred, or maybe Freddie. The numbering is something we /as authors/ do to distinguish which Fred Weasley we mean. It's something in the fandom wiki, or in character tags for the summary of a fic. No one who actually met him would be introduced to him as a boy with a number.

** I enjoy canon and epilogue compliant fics. Rowling left so many interesting storylines out of the books that one can easily right a compelling story solely based on canon. I look at it like filling in the blanks. [[/u/FloreatCastellum][u/FloreatCastellum]] essentially wrote the canon events of Book 7 from the POV of the students still at Hogwarts. That was a story worth telling that Rowling simply won't, so I'm glad for that type of fanfiction.

I also never had an issue with the epilogue in terms of what it signified, though the actual writing of it and the time period it covered was less than ideal. I like knowing everyone wound up happy, that Harry married Ginny and Ron married Hermione. Knowing (at the time) we wouldn't really get any more of the original series meant for me wanting to know Harry would turn out ok.

But that never meant there was nothing interesting to say in the time between the battle and the epilogue (which is why I was so bummed CC chose to focus on events after the epilogue and not before). A lot of questions were left up in the air. We know that everyone turned out well, but how did they get there? How did Harry and Co. go about rebuilding, both the wizarding world and their own lives? The great thing about epilogue compliant fics is that they can try to show Harry finally coming to terms with everything that happened. They can offer a better window into Ginny's character than the actual books showed us. We can learn more about Kingsley and the enormous burden he shouldered. And since we all care about the ships, we can see how both couples emerged from the war and grew together. That is actually interesting.

My issue with a lot of post-war compliant fics is they do what CC does, and try to insert another Voldemort-type. They ignore the more interesting story of these characters trying to live again. They make everyone blissfully happy and perfect couples and then make some new Death Eater the big bad villain.

** People have already given their opinion on why the epilogue is bad, but I want to take a bit of a different track:

*Authors who write Epilogue Compliant fics are too attached to canon.*

This sounds a bit like a 'duh' but has far reaching consequences. In a fic like this there will be almost no surprises and the general tone of the writing will be one of following convention and complacency. A large part of might be a novelization of Pottermore articles or interviews by JKR and otherwise a really boring account of mundane events.

I've always been a fan of 'high concept' stories. Arguably Harry Potter is one of those: /What if Magic was real and there's a secret society of Witches and Wizards across the world?/

If a story doesn't have a hook like this it's already very hard to pique my interest and if we're talking about something derivative like fanfiction doubly so.I'm not surprised that many of my favorite fanfictions can be summarized by such a "/What if...?/" type of question.

I think I gave my reasons why I find this kind of writing complacent and conventional. If you want to feel insulted by any kind of criticism (I haven't even read any of your fics, maybe your stories aren't conventional and complacent) that's not my problem.

This may be shocking to you, but there is /bad/ fanfiction. The general prejudice by people outside of fanfiction who think that it's just for people who have no ideas of their own has some truth to it. There's certain types of stories that are just a very elaborate form of playing with puppets and don't aspire to be anything else.

******* I'm actually not thinking of my own fics here, which I know you would dislike. In fact, I fully accept that you wouldn't like any canon compliant fics - you clearly don't like the pairings, you clearly think things should have been done differently, And as you say you like the what if aspect. All of that is fine and I'm not trying to persuade you otherwise.

I'm well aware of the heaps of bad fanfic, it's a major reason I don't read a lot of it. I just think you should recognise that that kind of puppetry is just as common in AU fics as well as canon compliant - I mean, what's more conventional than Harry finding out Dumbledore has been mean, he is actually a Lord, and going on a shopping trip for some overpowered items?

If you're here to criticise conventional and complacent fics in general, that's fine. But suggesting that authors (and by extension readers) lack creativity or ambition in their writing purely for their preference of canon compliancy is insulting. I don't take issue with other poster's suggestion that some canon compliant fics are smug about h/G, because they made sure to specify some, not All, and I'm sure they would agree that there are other fics that are unbearably smug about other things, like overpowered Mugglewank.

That's a pretty good point and I agree. Yes, I would call those fics complacent and conventional as well, especially if they follow all the common indie!Harry tropes like some kind of breadcrumb story line. But I don't think I'm a hypocrite here, because I don't like those stories very much at all and call them out for that as well. Actually I think I'm much more vocal about those because I actually read them and get pretty ticked off, when the grand manipulator, who's been in politics for decades is completely stumped by angry Harry. Any story that just crosses off plot points like items on a checklist (unless it's for subversion) is pretty bad.

In philosophy and rhetoric, the principle of charity or charitable interpretation requires interpreting a speaker's statements in the most rational way possible and, in the case of any argument, considering its best, strongest possible interpretation. In its narrowest sense, the goal of this methodological principle is to avoid attributing irrationality, logical fallacies, or falsehoods to the others' statements, when a coherent, rational interpretation of the statements is available.

******* Playing God by setting people up in accordance with the old timeline. Most notably Ron/Hermione and Tonks/Lupin. Quite often resorting to emotional blackmail or secrets entrusted in private (I've only seen this in canon pairing fics, never setting up Padma and Hermione).

Past crimes come with several, from preemptive punishment to gambling with the lives of the victims. Throw in some absolutely forced "redemptions". And when it comes to Snape and the Marauders, authors are often quite black and white (with Snape as poor victim instead of the canon "give and take punches").

Another funny one is a time traveling couple who used to be intimate but now has the bodies of children. I have honestly no clue what to think about this one, but the common solution of "wait for age X" is not really satisfying. Why not simply "when we feel like doing it, we are consenting adults after all"?

******** Have you read Nightmares of Futures Past?

- Harry certainly does worry about whether he's playing God, or rather, playing Dumbledore (whom he basically respects but does not trust). However, he keeps going because his original timeline was "everyone dies" and he plans to reveal his time travel when he can and then let his friends make their own judgements about whether he overstepped.

- Relationship building is strictly constructive, based primarily on being a better friend and secondarily on nudging Ron to pay attention to Hermione.

- Treatment of Snape is pretty black and white, yes, but in rather the opposite direction. The author is not a fan. Could be because he's studied developmental psychology and considers Snape a disgrace to educators everywhere. There's no actual preemptive punishment, though, just strong reactions.

- Only Harry went back, so the time traveling couple issue is N/A. Once Ginny knows that they were a couple, she's more forward than he is, though they still aren't officially dating due to the age gap.

- No way is this Harry letting his precious people die to preserve his foreknowledge.
