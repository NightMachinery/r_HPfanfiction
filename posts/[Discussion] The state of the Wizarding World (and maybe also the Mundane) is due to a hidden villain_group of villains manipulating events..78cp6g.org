Someone, or maybe a society of individuals a la Court of Owls, has been manipulating events throughout both worlds. I mean, look at the backwardness and ineptitude of most of the canon Wizarding World! What if someone was behind all that? Behind Grindelwald, Voldemort, and forging the characters we all know and love/hate. A fic where Voldemort isn't the main villain, nor Dumbledore, Grindelwald, or Dark!Harry.

Can you imagine the potential storyline that could evolve from this line of thought? The ramifications - good, bad, and worse - of having these seemingly all-powerful individuals manipulating everything; a threat in the shadows, or in plain sight. I'm also curious to know if there is a well-written fic that follows this basis. What do you think? While I /like/ HP, I do think that it sorely lacks in several areas (e.g. world-building), and something like this would really bring something new to the table.


** I think that this (like many ideas) would be a great concept IF it were executed well. However, I suspect that most authors would struggle to write a story like this without it coming across as hacky and kinda stupid. It's very, very difficult to write a villain or group of villains who has that kind of overarching control without plot holes making them seem like idiots or making them compelling villains for the hero to fight against.

Not saying it couldn't be done, but if I came across a fic with a description hinting at this, I'd be really skeptical of it going into it.

** For love of magic by noodlehammer sort of follows through on this. There's a core group of individuals who manipulate events from behind the scenes, playing Harry and Voldemort against each other. Definitely recommend it for this premise.

** Mm, but how would a hidden villain manipulate events? Select assassinations and false-flag operations, I assume.

I mean, revenge is a powerful motivator, and stereotyping and dehumanisation are powerful tools; a few well-arranged incidents might be all it takes to get purebloods and muggleborns at each others throats, or goblins to distrust wizards, or centaurs to hate hags, et-cetera.

That would make a proper Good!Harry a tremendous threat to their plans, of course. Idealistic, but more importantly forgiving person who actually has a lot of fame and therefore a lot of people listen to him? He'd be a huge threat to this nebulous evil organisation's plans. And imagine if he found out that someone was confounded/Imperiused to attack him for reasons NOT relating to Voldemort? What if Sybill Trelawney of all people detected them and prophecied their involvement in Harry's life?

...Huh, maybe that's why Harry's life tends to suck so much in canon. Neglectful relatives, shunned in first year after losing a ton of points, shunned in second year after being exposed as a Parselmouth, exposed in third year to dementors, trapped in the Triwizard Tournament in fourth year, harassed by the government in fifth year and of course Voldemort trying to kill him; all because a mysterious agent went "His body and soul are protected by love magic AND he's ridiculously famous? Oh, /shit/."

** I feel like calling normal people 'mundanes' is a lot more demeaning than calling them muggles. You'd think if being called a muggle was considered offensive, Hermione would be the first one to be outraged, but nowhere in the books does she think that it's pejorative, and she uses the term a lot as well. You realize being mundane is to be dull, boring, and uninteresting, right?

Also, how is the canon magical world more backwards and inept than our current world? Because they're prejudiced against people different from them? Americans just elected a man that said he would build a wall so those Mexicans couldn't come in. The UK just voted to leave the EU. It's only in very recent memory that homosexuals started receiving rights. Slavery existed in the USA just a century and a half ago.

I think it's meant to be the [[https://www.google.com/search?q=define%3Amundane&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8][second definition]]. The natural versus the supernatural; the normal versus the paranormal.

Using mundane, though, could also be seen as self-demeaning. A wizard calling a muggle a mundane is tacitly admitting that the wizard is abnormal and/or unnatural.

**** Sure, but I don't think witches and wizards see themselves as any more 'heavenly' or 'spiritual' than muggles. Some might see themselves as better, sure, but for most magic is just a normal part of life. There's nothing special about magic to them.

And yeah, most Americans didn't vote for Trump. But I guess what I was mostly pointing towards was the fact that many governments right now aren't very progressive, and quite conservative and afraid of change, in fact. When you look at the wizarding world person by person, they're not really that backwards or racist. When you look at the government as a whole, though, you see the same things in the Ministry of Magic that you see in governments everywhere. So it's a bit hypocritical to point to the Ministry in HP and say, "Oh look how backwards and inept they are compared to us!" when it's not true at all.

*** I completely agree. Is a distinguished muggle like Usain Bolt / Albert Einstein / Angela Merkel / JK Rowling really more 'mundane' than Minstry Clerk #342?

It is demeaning because it basically says "No matter what you achieve in life as a muggle, the achievements of the most boring wizard will be more exciting."

This is the same argument people have been having for years about mutants in the xmen, mutants are superior the arguement there is if genocude of normal humans is correct for the betterment of mutant kind.

***** You need to think about whether the worst wizard is 'better' / 'more extrodinary' than the best Muggle.

From the examples we have seen in canon, I do not think that is the case, and thus it is insulting to claim otherwise.

Also, being better or worse isn't one-dimensional. Steven Hawking for example is bad at a lot of "human" things, including the most basic ones. However, he is still extraordinary in his understanding of modern physics, and I certainly wouldn't say he is more mundane than me, even if I can walk and he can't.

And with 'good' or 'bad' I was not referring to Voldemort, but rather Ministry clerk #387 who mostly sits around in his office all day vs. Albert Einstein who helped us to understand the world better.

If you were to compare those two it is rather insulting to call Einstein mundane.

Yes, on a species level wizards are superior, I do not disagree with that. But that is not the fucking point.

***** Define ‘better'.

A deranged murdering psychopath with superpowers is NOT better than an average person with no special powers.

You are basically following the Nazi eugenics argument that ‘lesser' human beings should be exterminated.

But where do you draw the line? Should people with higher IQ or SAT scores lord over or even murder those who have lower scores?

****** No i am arguing science, an animal that has magic (of which acidental magic alone is proven to increase survival chances) is better than one that doesnt posses magic. On a completely scientific level, wizards are superior to us muggles. Magic is an evolutionary advantage much in the same way that humans extremely developed brain led to our domination of the planet.

Regardless of you taking my side of the debate as a personal attack and bringing up Nazis imediately (as if that has anything to do with this) no where in my comment did i say that eugenics was an admirable or even morally neutral concept.

*** I sort of agree. Rowling has used the term to refer to the non-magical, but I don't think she has actually called muggles, mundanes.

Nevertheless. I feel like people are just getting offended by mundane for no reason. It's absolutely possible that an alternative definition evolved for the word in the wizarding world to specifically refer to non-magical things. This includes people. It's not even unbelievable in any way.

**** I don't think you understand the reason, though. It's not solely because of the definition, it's because there already is a term set in place in canon to describe the nonmagical population. There are two terms, actually. Saying mudblood is not acceptable in polite company, but saying muggle is. That's because no one in the wizarding world thinks that the word muggle is a pejorative term -- not even Hermione.

But for whatever reason, fanfic authors get this idea in their head that "muggle" was a racist term, when it clearly was never meant to be or used in such a manner... and in all their brilliance, decided that calling people mundane was somehow less rude.

There's also a new term that's become canon within the past couple years with "no-maj". A much more Harry Potter-esque term, and not insulting in the least.
