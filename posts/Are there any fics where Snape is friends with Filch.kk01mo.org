They had that once chat about the dog in the first book and it got me wondering if there are any fics where they banter together, probably about punching children or something, or maybe they crochet together, who knows


** There's a lot of fics out there featuring Snilch. A few years ago I read a fic where Filch was a mentor/ex-lover. I don't remember what it was called but it was decently written. If anyone finds it, please let me know.
