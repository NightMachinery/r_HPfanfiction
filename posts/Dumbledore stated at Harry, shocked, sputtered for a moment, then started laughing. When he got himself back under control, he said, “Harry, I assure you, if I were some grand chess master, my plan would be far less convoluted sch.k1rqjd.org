** "You made me fight a bloody Basilisk in my second year!"

"I made you? No, Harry, it was /you/ who made the decision to go to the Chamber of Secrets, accompanief with naught but your friend Ronald and a teacher you knew was a fraud. Those actions can only be put on /your/ head."

"And what about Sirius, huh? You wanted him gone so I could grow unloved and weak by the Dursleys! Even after you knew I knew about his innocence, you didn't grant him a trial!"

"Of course, Harry. Just let me use my almighty political power to grant a trial to someone whom absolutely everybody is convinced is guilty of treason, mass murder, and more. I am sure that will go well for all of us."

"You could have used Veritaserum for the trial! Or your memories of seeing Pettigrew! Or hell, our for that matter!"

"Veritaserum does not force you to tell the truth, only a version of the truth you believe in. Harry, if I wanted Sirius Black gone from your life, I'd just kill him. And if I wanted you "weak and unloved", I'd have sent you to an orphanage, where I know wizards are treated poorly by the other children."

"And what about the tournament, huh? You-"

"Magical contract. Again, if I wanted to test you, I wouldn't need to let a /Death Eater/ enter my /school/, polyjuiced as one of my most trusted friends. I would just have put your name in myself."

​

I could go on and on, but I'm bad at conclusions. So cheers!

** "Now then Harry, I imagine you have some questions?"

Harry sat up slightly in his hospital wing bed and attempted to gather his thoughts - fresh from his encounter with the murderous Defense Against the Darks Arts teacher (and to think he'd once thought the overpowering smell of garlic was Quirrel's worst quality!), he struggled to put his confusion into words.

Eventually, he asked "Sir... was this all meant to happen? Did you plan everything out this way?"

"Dreams are a funny thing Harry - I certainly never expected to end up as Headmaster of Hogwarts, though I'd had occasional dreams of teaching. Why I remember back in my fifth year I was approached by a particularly despondent third year-"

"No sir, I meant the Philosopher's Stone, the gauntlet under the trapdoor. Did you plan for me and my friends to go through it?"

"What sort of educator do you take me for Harry? I'd never willingly endanger my students!"

"It's just...we studied the Devil's Snare in Herbology class this year, and then there was one underneath the trapdoor..."

"Harry, I sincerely hope you never have to experience the pain of attempting to requisition a plant from a Herbology enthusiast. You should have heard Pomona go on and on: 'But what about the equinox?' and 'I couldn't possibly give up more than 3 stems' and 'You'll never touch Reginald!' Believe me, I bargained hard to get that Devil's Snare and I'm going to pay for it come performance review season."

"Well, what about Flitwick's room? The one with all the keys that requires expert flying skills? Is it a coincidence that I'm the only first year on a Quidditch team and that's a room?"

"The Hogwarts bylaws are a mystery unto themselves Harry. I'm sure you remember when Mr. Longbottom suffered that regrettable incident in your flying lesson earlier this year? Rolanda - Professor Hooch to you I suppose - put her foot down and insisted that the school brooms needed replacing. It turns out step 37 of 243 in the byzantine checklist that must be completed before funds can be dispersed for replacing the school brooms requires testing them against animated keys. And Filius worked so hard on the keys, it seemed a waste to just unanimate them afterwards."

Dumbledore leaned closer and said "Just between you and me, I was expecting the brooms themselves to take down Voldemort - he's long since lost his eye for broom maintenance. You must have found the last few decent brooms in the pile by chance."

Bemused but not yet defeated, Harry continued "I see. But what about the chess set? Chess prodigy Ronald Weasley comes to Hogwarts and you have McGonagall create an animated chess game?"

"Is Mr. Weasley a fan of chess? I'd have expected him to take after his father - Arthur's a devil of a hand at Whist. No, I'm afraid Professor McGonagall has an unfortunate habit of transfiguring animated chess pieces - in fact, I recall a humorous incident involving a Rook, the staff room, and Professor Kettleburn's wooden leg - now, Kettleburn had just returned from Antigua and-"

"But what about the logic puzzle?" Harry interjected, slightly panicked. "Hermione said that most wizards haven't an ounce of logic, so it was an especially clever trap. Doesn't that mean it was made for someone like her, who wasn't raised in the wizarding world?"

"Ah Harry, it truly warms my heart to see that you and your friends have finally begun to take Professor Snape's lessons to heart. Ms. Granger in particular must have grown particularly close with him if he's sharing his favorite sayings with her now! I'll have to give him an extra lemon drop next time he stops by for a chat."

"But...but...Fluffy! I mean, that had to have been planned, right? I mean, Hagrid gave me a wooden flute for Christmas!"

"Oh, he's moved on to flutes now? Thank goodness you missed his furniture phase, we must have furnished half a dozen classrooms and all of the guest rooms with his workings by now. Beautiful craftsmanship, but he just needs something to occupy his hands and there's only so many Adirondack chairs one needs in life!"

"So... that's it?" Dazed, Harry took a moment to resettle both his glasses and his worldview. "It was all just a series of coincidences? There was no master plan?"

"Oh Harry. Look at me, really take a hard look. Do I look like a man with a plan?"

And Harry did look. At the elderly man wearing lime green robes and a sleeping cap patterned with winking suns and frowning moons. With a beard braided with pink bows and... small animal bones?

"This whole world is just nutters" he exclaimed with a sigh.

"Ah, now you're beginning to get it!" smiled Dumbledore.

**** I wanted to try and make it mirror TDK more closely but it didn't seem to fit the spirit of the prompt since Dumbledore was pretty benign in the prompt.

Did vaguely kick off a thought of reversing the "Wanna see me make this pencil disappear" gag by having someone actually vanish it with Evanesco though.
