I've read a lot of time-travel/fixfics, and I've gotten really tired of seeing rationalizations of why Dumbledore would turn into a powerful enemy if anyone bothered to let him know what's going on or how he might be able to help. Some of it even crosses into honest character bashing.

  After the war, Hermione is haunted by the friends she lost, so she comes up with an audacious plan to fix it, starting way back with Harry's parents. Now, all she has to do is get herself taken seriously in 1981, and then find a way to get her old life back when she's done.
