I forget which one but Harry puts wormtail on trial I front of the ministry, Dumbledore pleads for mercy, and Arthur loses it. Calling him scabbers and talking about his violated honour etc. It was beautiful.


** It might have been linkffn(6633092) Susan Bones & The Prisoner of Azkaban?\\
I don't want to check, it's a fic that rubs me the wrong way in the later chapters, but I remember a scene where Arthur challenges Peter to a duel before the latter's trial, and the latter flees straight into a dementor.\\
Or perhaps that scene was in a different fic.

  What if Harry Potter was sent to Azkaban for killing Cedric Diggory? What if a Hufflepuff questioned his conviction?
