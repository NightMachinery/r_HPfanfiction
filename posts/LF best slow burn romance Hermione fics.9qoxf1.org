Do you know any best romance of any pairings (except Ronmione, sorry but it doesn't make sense to me, my opinion) with Hermione just slow burn romance, well-written and preferrably something dark or non-fluff that is complete? Thank you!

  Kreacher sends Hermione back in time with the hopes that she will save Regulus an destroy the locket. Hermione figures she will have an ally to help her destroy the other horcruxes, too. But, Regulus Black doesn't turn out to be anything like she expected he would. Regulus x Hermione. Time Travel. COMPLETE!

*** I don't want to come across as a hater, but Nautical Paranoir's pureblood Tradition might get tiresome for some readers. It was fun a few times, but I got tired of it by Oblivion. It may also have been with how weak she portrayed Hermione as in red right hand, which started so well but veered off course into a depressing direction, and I could see similar character traits appearing in this.

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days.

Blood and Gold is another time travel fic. Hermione tries to go back and kill Riddle before he is born, naturally that doesn't work out and she is sent to the period when he works at Borgin and Burkes. It's still in the early stages. Hr/TR linkao3(Blood and Gold)

  Hermione Granger couldn't help but think that no matter how difficult they had all figured rebuilding their society would be, no one was expecting anything quite like this. It was another stark reminder that just when things were finally starting to level out, they would never truly have peace and stability. Her entire life in the magical world had been full of shocks and stumbles, and this one seemed like the biggest of them all.A post-war Dramione marriage law fic... with a twist!

  The true time-turner was slammed savagely into Hermione's throat. It shattered against her neck, bits of glass and gold piercing into her skin. The last thing she saw before blackness consumed her was a plume of metallic dust and vitreous fragments, tiny prisms dancing behind her eyelids. (In which Hermione accidentally ends up in 1950, pitted against an ascending Dark Lord in his prime, caught in the entanglement of pureblood politics, dark magic, and Tom Riddle's interest)

***** her writing is so goddamn incredible. not to sound like an obsessed fanboy with nothing better to do than read and blog, but i reread something of hers at least every week

i have a theory that the Lunas in her fics are at least somewhat omniscient and aware of the different timelines. examples:

-"Rebuilding" Chapter 138, about halfway down -how she anticipates the Titus Andronicus stuff and the whole semi-possession thing in "Lady of the Lake"

-in "The Green Girl" the "you aren't mean to me" line, idr what chapter number it is but it's the scene where she first meets them

-Luna consistently being described as "fey" and her almost total absence in the "Fairy Stone" fic. coincidence? I THINK NOT. Luna has super sanity. she's like the Deadpool of the Wizarding World.

If Snape gets a major character redemption arc, I'm pretty sure a 17 years old deserves one even as cowardly as he is. But also, it kinda reminds me of Romeo and Juliet minus the "i'm kinda stupid so i'll die with my love" and the dark fics are just amazing.

*** Omg my OTP has always been Dramione. It was what brought me to Harry Potter fanfics. But I think I've already scoured through all the "best" written thought out plot and all around legendary Dramione fics for all my 4 years of reading it. So if you know some that I have missed and that is completed, I am very grateful if you recommend it to me. :) I'm just on a long break from Dramione bc i can't seem to find another diamond in the rough.

*** Sorry this took a couple days, everyone! Here are a few of my favourite Dramione's that I don't see recc'd as much:

- linkao3(Nobility by olivieblake) - veeeeery slow burn, a lot of Tom/Hermione for the first like... 75%? Definitely dark but so good. It does end as Dramione!
- linkao3(As Certain Dark Things Are To Be Loved by somuchcloser) is a brilliant dark slow burn. It does get lighter and it does start Hermione/Ron, but the Dramione is so worth it!
- linkffn(Broken by inadaze22) is another dark slow burn, also with some dark elements
- linkao3(Ride or Die by olivieblake) is one of my FAVOURITES - a modern AU and not exactly slow burn in the sense that they have sex early, but their relationship develops a lot over the course of the fic and it's really just a lot of fun.
- linkffn(Rebuilding by colubrina) is a great and quite long 8th year / post war fic.

I would highly recommend any of olivieblake's works - she has a few others I haven't tagged but they're all great. Same with colubrina, who has been rec'd already in this thread. There's also dramioneasks.tumblr.com which has a TON of suggestions.

Man, I always think I have more than I come up with for these lists. I KNOW I've got more to rec I just can't think of them. :/ Still, I hope you find at least one new one in there to help out!

******* I have seen that relationship in fanfiction often enough to recognize a lost case. In 98 out of a hundred cases they don't act as they are in love (fight all the time, no loving interactions, not compromising to have a good time together) and the other two have a believable relationship but the author feels the need to bash them for some reason.

The only time I see them actually work like a real couple and not just a parody of one is in stories where they seduce Harry into a triad.

#+begin_quote
  Change (...) personalities
#+end_quote

That's the one thing to avoid in fanfiction unless you have a good reason and ironically, Sirius death is the most believable trigger, despite the countless bad stories it spawned. The three plausible triggers for Ron would be the attack on Arthur, Malfoy almost killing him and the death of Fred, but even then it would be a long road and authors never bother to show how he is changing.
