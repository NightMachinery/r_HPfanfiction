Sorry guys I bet that this gets posted a lot! I'm in the mood for some really good dramione, maybe some less well known ones which are underappreciated? I've read most of the biggies, any suggestions will be great!


** Hmmmmm... depending on how familiar you are with Dramione.org, you may or may not have read some of these. I added in the everythursday ones because it's pretty much obligatory at this point for me... (Sorry!) I compiled a list of my previously recommended Dramione... if I see anything else in my AO3 bookmarks, I'll add them in...

[[http://dramione.org/viewstory.php?sid=1][The Fallout by everythursday]] Hermione learns about growing up through the redemption of Draco Malfoy.

[[http://dramione.org/viewstory.php?sid=1034][When the Bell Tolls by everythursday]] As a Dark revival begins to rise four years after the war, Hermione Granger is placed on the assignment of putting an end to them -- and her first task is to recruit the Ministry's best hope and last option in the form of Draco Malfoy.

[[http://dramione.org/viewstory.php?sid=367][Parade of the Sun by everythursday]] Floralis Fati is a plant with the power to control time, hidden in the wild, and protected by a magic that strips people of their own while seeking to kill them.

[[http://dramione.org/viewstory.php?sid=57][Heavy Lies the Crown by Floorcoaster]] Canst thou, O partial sleep, give thy repose To the wet sea-boy in an hour so rude, And in the calmest and most stillest night, With all appliances and means to boot, Deny it to a king?

[[http://dramione.org/viewstory.php?sid=718][Thirteenth Night by Nelpher]] When Hermione is assigned to keep tabs on a memory-charmed Draco, she is faced with a decision that could change her life forever.

[[http://dramione.org/viewstory.php?sid=14][The Fool, the Emperor, and the Hanged Man by ianthe_waiting]] Ten years after the fall of the Dark Lord, Hermione Granger leads a life of self-imposed obscurity, that is, until the day Headmistress Minerva McGonagall is murdered and a certain 'hero' is responsible.

[[http://dramione.org/viewstory.php?sid=1412][The Observer by Powerofthebook]] Who is behind the skyrocketing trend in illegal potions abuse? The Ministry of Magic wants to know. Of less importance to most - who thought it would be funny to pair up Investigators Malfoy and Granger and put them on the case?

[[http://dramione.org/viewstory.php?sid=22][Tender Vengeance by Margot Le Faye]] Setting out to capture Ginny Weasley, the Death Eaters also take Hermione Granger. Instead of killing the Muggle-born outright, Voldemort subjects her to an insidious bit of dark magic which turns her into a prize for one of his faithful.

[[http://dramione.org/viewstory.php?sid=3090][Apple Pie and Other Amends by ToEatAPeach]] Sometimes you're sad. Sometimes you need dessert. And sometimes, it's a little of both.

[[http://dramione.org/viewstory.php?sid=2614][With Teeth by Provacative Envy]] Albus Dumbledore had been wrong about Voldemort's horcruxes.There had never been just seven---or eight, technically, if Harry's scar was being counted.There had been seven hundred and seventy-seven.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9831689/1/The-Deadline][The Deadline by Lena Phoria]] It takes the unexpected engagement of their children to get Draco and Hermione in a room together, but only the selfish acts of their estranged spouses and a 300 Galleon bottle of firewhiskey will get them in a bedroom. What starts out as a one time mistake soon becomes a full-blown affair with a deadline; the day their children say 'I do'. But things rarely go according to plan.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2618329/1/The-Politician-s-Wife][The Politician's Wife by pir8fancier]] Hermione hates Draco in the springtime, Hermione hates Draco in the fall, Hermione hates Draco 247.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/305968][Partners by Musyc]] Who ever thought that it'd be a good idea to have Malfoy and Granger work together? So far, there's been three requests for a transfer, two broken back-up wands, a gross-inflated hospital bill for a 'mauling by half-Kneazle', and one exceptionally fine pair of Dragonhide boots set on fire.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/301431][An Inconvenient Wedding by smutty_claus, Snegurochka]] When Scorpius and Lily announce their engagement, it really couldn't come at a worse time for Draco and Hermione.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/242815][Amateur Cartography by worksofstone]] That one-night stand with Draco Malfoy was a mistake. Hermione doesn't make mistakes, or at least she isn't supposed to. She's working hard at her Ministry career, however frustrating and pointless her job may be, and she's also got to live up to everyone's expectations as Hogwarts's most famous Muggle-born and a top-tier War Hero. So, why is she still sleeping with Draco Malfoy, ex-Death Eater and infamous pureblood? And why isn't she certain that she wants to stop?

[[http://dramione.org/viewstory.php?sid=3195][In Reverse by ToEatAPeach]] "Your hair," he says, without looking at her. "It's enormous, you know." A few, silent seconds pass, before Hermione makes a happy sort of sob. "Your chin is too sharp," she whispers. "We grew into them." "We certainly did." Suddenly, her perfect mouth is on his, and he realizes that maybe he hasn't ruined anything after all. A Dramione love story, in reverse

[[http://dramione.org/viewstory.php?sid=2616][Bitter/Sweet by provocative envy]] It was half past eleven when he pushed the cheese plate away and rolled up his left shirt sleeve. "It took six hours to stick,” he said blearily, grey eyes glittering in the purposefully dim candlelight. “They said---my father said---it was because I didn't want it badly enough.”

[[http://dramione.org/viewstory.php?sid=2614][With teeth by provocative envy]] Albus Dumbledore had been wrong about Voldemort's horcruxes. There had never been just seven---or eight, technically, if Harry's scar was being counted. There had been seven hundred and seventy-seven.

[[http://dramione.org/viewstory.php?sid=1716&chapter=1][Ghosts in a Wishing Well by namelessamelie]] He could never stay away for very long. // “Everything is more beautiful because we're doomed. You will never be lovelier than you are now. We will never be here again.” -- The Iliad
