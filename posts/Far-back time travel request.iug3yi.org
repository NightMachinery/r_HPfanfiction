Hi does anyone have any /good/ fics where preferably harry gets sent back to a period of history? I don't mean do-over fics or marauders era, I mean like ancient Egypt or ww1 Britain or anything properly in the past basically... Thanks :D

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

  Living for a century is an accomplishment, even for a wizard. Two is a rarity. Living them all? That is the territory of the gods. Harry Potter remembers a cat's glowing eyes, a strange old man with a wicked smile, and pain. It is the year 3050 B.C.E. and he has all of history as his future.

The time travel happens in part three, though it's worth the wait as someone from the Founder era time travels to 1995 first. The story has a slash relationship but it's not the focus of the story.

The best fic I've read.
