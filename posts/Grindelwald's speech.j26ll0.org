Am I the only one who was moved by Grindelwald's speech?

The part about wanting to stop living in secret, and being open to society about who they are?

His method to reach such a destination a No No. But the idea is attractive.

Especially the part where he showed the crowd of World War 2, and he told them that those weapons can be turned against them.


** It's what makes Grindelwald scarier to me than Voldemort. The fact that he could move so many people with his words is scary to me.

Voldemort seemed to have a smaller but more fanatical group. Grindelwald appealed to the masses. That's what made him scary. His message sounded a lot better to everybody than Voldemort's message ever did.

** It's a good speech. He starts by heaping praise and compliments on the attendees, something Voldemort could never have pulled off with sincerity. Then he cleverly twists the narrative about his Muggle views by saying he does /not/ hate them. "I say the Muggles are not lesser, but /other./"

This makes his views seem less extreme, and more appealing to those who might be hesitant to commit to a violent cause. It sounds like the "separate but equal" laws in the US prior to Brown v. Board of Education which were of course complete horse shit. Grindelwald insists Muggles are "not worthless, but of other value." This is purposely vague to allow his audience to fill in the gaps, and decide what their own ideas of "other value" consists of.

"Magic blooms only in rare souls." Again he is complimenting the attendees, building them up with visionary talk. He uses the words "freedom, truth, and love" to make his views seem righteous. Who is going to argue against those things?

Then he shows them visions of the next World War, pain, suffering, destruction, and says this will come to pass if we don't rise up. It's almost a threat veiled as a warning. Join me, or else. Finally he blames Muggles for having "power lust" as a diversion from his own desires.

He rarely shouts or uses vigorous hand motions like some crazed Fuhrer. Grindelwald comes across as calm and rational and that's what makes his honeyed words enticing. Good speech by a good actor, imo.

*** If magic works in outer space (and doesn't have to rely on living things according to some lore), their best solution is to colonize other planets and create their own worlds. They should have it a lot easier than Muggles, their advantages would be huge, and the whole galaxy is for their taking!

**** That is actually used quite often, as is the "magic only works on earth" trope - both depend on the specific "magic system" of the fanfic setting, as this is VERY loosely defined (or, as it happens, not defined at all) in canon.

Along the same thought as the "space exploration/colonization" trope is the "alternate/sub/parallel/higher dimension" trope, which makes a bit more sense magically (as much as that ever makes sense) as we know that space expansion is a thing in canon and hasn't had any rules bound to it. You could write a story with the wizarding world all existing in a subspace behind the portal at 9¾ if you want to (AiW anyone?) and technically be canon-compliant with your magic use. The dimension-tropes is, in my experience, less used than the space-tropes - mainly because SW, "magic breaks ALL laws of physics/thermodynamics/relativity/quantum mechanics/life" and similar - I think I've said it somewhere on this subreddit before, but the systems put in place makes or breaks fiction, be that fighting, strategy, politics, magic or any other lore.

I'm still wondering how Fudge became Minister in Canon, how the voting system works, why Hogwarts isn't a day-school (seriously, they have several types of instant or near-instant travel available) and why anyone thought having a dead guy teach history (both past and current), a drunk teach how to predict the future and a known double agent teach ADVANCED CHEMISTRY WITH ADDED MAGICAL HIJINKS to teens and pre-teens was a good idea. Was there ever a class on the magical equivalent of gloves and safety goggles? Or the malleability/subjectivity of time? Even just a talk about why knowing the events of the past is so important for the future?

I went on a tangent, so very sorry about the wall of text, my rant is done

** That's generally how they getcha. We even have a term for it - 'demagoguery'. If politicians, tyrants, and revolutionaries couldn't move people, they wouldn't get anywhere, and adding in script-writers on top of that would only make it more appealing. I imagine there were many people moved by that speech.

hitler was able to craft speechs that used the bitterness of said people in that country to achieve his ends.

I imagine if you took one of hitlers speechs and removed the fact it was from hitler and played it to a random crowd, I imagine they might be taken along with it as well

****** I mean, that's a vastly oversimplified explanation of a very complex causal network. There's no single reason a demagogue rises, it could even be a totally systemic thing where multiple reasons have created a situation in which a demagogue is greeted with open arms.

I'd say the most general explanation is because they want something they don't feel they're getting or they have a need they feel isn't met (or that they've been convinced they need). Demagogues can rise on the issues of faith, military, social issues, political issues, money, history, nationalism. And they can rise by meeting those needs or by redirecting the blame to people they persuaded the masses to hate.

******** Not at all. Being ignored requires a person or institution to ignore them. A need requires a lack. You can't be ignored by nothing, after all. A nitpicky difference, most definitely, but nitpicky differences are really important when you're looking at how people think about stuff and how to convince them to think in certain ways. And it's a lot easier to convince someone they're being ignored when they aren't than it is to convince them they don't have something they do.

And technically Hitler rose due to manipulating aggression and accusation. He came in right at the point of war payments (the Allies demanded a lot of very pricy things from the German goverment post-WWI) and turned the anger at the ruinous payments towards the government, then towards the various non-Aryan groups he wanted people to not like who he claimed were polluting the system and generally being the cause of all their problems (scapegoating). It wasn't that people felt ignored, it was people feeling angry and him manipulating that anger towards convenient targets that would get them following him.

** Unpopular hot take: Both Magneto and Grindelwald were right.

On a larger note, this has been a long time annoyance I have with such themes in fiction. I feel like the majority of allegories to racism in fiction fully miss the point about why racism is a bane that must be fought against. It's because it's *not true!* There is no superior race, heck, there is no race to begin with! We're all Homo sapiens, some regional adaptation to climate does not mean Humanity split off again. There is no blood superiority, skin color superiority, gender, sexuality, whatever, *we are all equal!*

And then come fictional allegories to racism, where... races are objectively *unequal.* Take the Potterverse. Wizards are as close to a god that you can get. Consider their capabilities alone and disregard all of Rowling's crappy worldbuilding and plot conveniences. Can you imagine how such a society would really function? How terrifying it would be? Humanity would have more chances at defeating a Type III alien civ than *one,* half competent wizard.

I don't understand how authors expect us all to be like yaaay! freedom! yaay! equality! yaay! cohabitation! when they create these horribly unbalanced and fully distinct races. Why would literal demigods bend the knee to someone that to them is like what Neanderthals are to us?

** I can't help but think that a world where the Wizards ended their secrecy would be alike a nightmare. Just as Grinderwald said in his speech, humans are foolish, arrogant creatures.

If they ended the Secrecy, would the wizard accept to live under the rule of their Muggle counterpart? Would the leaders of the world, accept to let these people, waving a power they cannot understand, outside of their control? Would their counselor accept this? Would the rest of the world?

Outside of their anonymat, Wizards would be attacked from all sides. The ambitious would try to gain their favour and help into some plots. The fanatics would hate them for being differents. The parents would hate them, for were not here when their children died.

Wizards would be feared, and the Muggleborns would become a target. Trained adult may be able to defend themselves, but children are not so lucky. People would be accused to be magical left and right, just because something strange happened near them, and for people with money, Muggleborns children would become an object of high value. A test subject in the hope to understand Magic for some, a perfect soldier, being trained to be loyal since his childhood for others, or just a sex slave to bear a magical heir.

Wizards would be forced to take power just to exist. To enslave the rest of the world just so they could live in peace. And even taking power would not end their troubles, as the difficulty in power is to keep it. Children would have to be protected at all cost, Renegade wizards to be captured or put down, and insurections destroyed before they could do too much damages.

And all these troubles for what end? What could the Muggle offer that the wizards do not already have? They do not care for land as they can multiply it, they do not care for goods as they can easily acquire it. All these troubles would just be to end the minor annoyance to live in secrecy, and for some to have the satisfaction to lord other Muggles. Would that be really worth it?

​

Also, I doubt that Grinderwald was totally honest during his speech. He probably believes more in his ideology than Voldemort did with Blood Supremacy, but he would probably still be ready to adapt his whole ideology depending of the situation.
