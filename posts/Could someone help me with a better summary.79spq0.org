** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/12568760/1/][*/Iris Potter and the Goblet's Surprise/*]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/8816781/Autumn-Souls][/Autumn Souls/]]

#+begin_quote
  She's sarcastic, reckless, quick-witted, sassy, and much more, but when faced with future tasks, not just from the Triwizard Tournament, there's one trait Iris Potter is willing to throw out --- laziness. Five mostly unique tasks, Animagi, humor, numerous magical creatures, and the beginning to a morally ambiguous and powerful but not overpowered fem!Harry. No bashing. Fourth year.
