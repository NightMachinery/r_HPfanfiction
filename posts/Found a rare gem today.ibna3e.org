It's a crackfic I've never read before and isn't in the big crackfic list.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone: a DUMM Story)

It's essentially what would happen if you took the entire first HP book and bashed THAT, instead of specifically bashing a character. Also a lot of swearing.

  Life is boring for young Harry Potter, but then his family gets harassed and stalked by a large hairy postman determined to give him a letter and his entire world changes for the stupider. Join Harry on his descent into madness. (Crackfic, swearing stupidity and I am so sorry).
