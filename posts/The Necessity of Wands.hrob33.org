I was just reading [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12188454/]] a crossover between Charmed and Harry Potter and it got me thinking about how a lot of writers hype up wand based magics. I've also seen stories where the opposite is true. I know I'm partial to magic without wands and love extremely overpowered Harry stories as a by product. On the whole i believe that they are a good starting point that gets dropped off the more experience the individual gains. What of you all? I want to see other people's perspectives on the topic.

Try to keep bashing out of it please.


** While wandless casting is a mark of a good wizard, I'm almost certain spells produced that way are weaker. It can be a useful tool in a duel, but realistically one shouldn't rely on it solely.

*** I think I'm of the mind that not all spells are meant to be performed with a wand or a spell. It feels like the purpose of wands are to control magic, rather than being the only way that people can perform magic. Elves, goblins, etc can all do wandless magic, but its the kind of magic that never needed a wand to begin with. But if the ministry suddenly starts popularizing wandless styles of magic, they lose their command over the populace pretty quickly, which is why "breaking wands" or threatening to take away someone's wand is such a big deal.

I don't think that all magical societies operate off wands with a core and a wood, and I bet some don't use wands at all. I wonder if in the past, there were other groups of oppressed individuals that weren't permitted to carry wands - witches, the poor, etc.

They're not and not all magic requires a wand either. Spells that can be performed with the help of wands are just weaker when they're wandless.

JKR has it that Africans and Indigenous Americans are more fond of wandless magic and are generally superior with magic that doesn't require (too much) wand magic i.e. herbology, animagi, potion making, astronomy.

***** Point. However I would reverse the wording. They are taught wandless magic, but use wands as a side.

In my mind I see wand magic as something brought in from the outside. That before its introduction the magic users used magic as more of an organic part of their day to day survival. Not more or less powerful than its wand counterpart. Simply different.

** Personally I see wands as what they are, something to focus your magic. In my head it's entirely possible to do magic without one and it may even be more ‘powerful' to an extent, but for stuff like enchanting and (yes, I know it's fanon) Warding I feel like wands are necessary to achieve the needed precision.

**** To a certain extent warding is canon, but generally it's treated as different in fanfics. In canon it's just protective charms placed over an area, in fanfics they're usually done with "warding stones," often paired with Ancient Runes (to inscribe on the stones), and there's generally someone linked to the wards who can control them in some fashion.

This is one area where I prefer fanfiction to canon, since canon is actually really limited in terms of spell variety when you break it down. There seems to only be two categories of spells in canon- Transfiguration and Charms. Basically every spell can be categorized as one or the other; even the Dark Arts are just "Dark Charms" (categorized as Jinxes, Hexes, and Curses depending on how badly they effect the target).

Healing spells aren't really delved into in canon but could easily fit into either category depending on what's actually happening on a technical level (for example, some kind of skin-knitting spell could be Transfiguration, just transforming the cut skin into non-cut skin). Other than that, there's Divination and Arithmancy, both about divining the future and neither seem to have proper spells attached to them. They seem to be a more loose kind of magic that isn't categorize. Ancient Runes is just a language class in canon and doesn't seem to have any use, except perhaps to read old magical books/other writings. And Potions and Herbology also aren't spell-related magics.

** I figure it's comparable to any other tool or machine ie. a knife, a hammer, a lever, etc etc.

They take the same force (what your body produces) but focus it into much more useful directions.

So yes, you can learn to pound nails with your bare hands, or rip cloth with your fingers and teeth, or lift very heavy things, you're almost certainly going to achieve the same or better result, with far less effort, by using the appropriate device.

** My headcanon is that wandless magic cannot be used for the point and shoot spells (ie. stupefy). The ones where a flash of light comes out and does something complicated to its target is only possible with a wand.

Wandless magic works with summoning, lumos, cutting, fire (& other elements), simple charms (like win/gar/dium levi/o/sa) minor healing spells, transfiguring things that are in your hand or very close by, etc.

Wandless magic doesn't work for creating wards, enchanting, long distance transfiguration, any of the bigger healing spells, diagnostic spells, complicated charms (like the Fidelius), and the point and shoot spells (like stupefy and avada kedavra)

Interestingly, I think it's canon that apparition and the animagus transformation require a wand, but I think those things, as well as Voldemort's flight spell don't require one because you're casting it on yourself so you can use your whole body as a conduit.

** I've seen two main theories and I like them both. The first is that wands focus your magic and are a useful conduit for directing it into spells. It helps to strengthen your magic essentially by focusing it into a single point through a magical core (not that kind). Wandless magic is generally weaker but can be strengthened through practice, similar to nonverbal magic. It's not very useful for your average wizard going through their daily lives, with exception to a few spells probably, but for someone in a fight it's good to have as a backup in case you lose your wand.

The other theory is similar but kind of the opposite. Wandless magic is far more powerful, but also a lot more difficult to control. Wands allow you to focus it, and in exchange for this extra control you lose out on some of the power of your spells. Because the students are taught to focus their magic through a wand at such an early age, it's more difficult for them to learn wandless magic since they haven't learned to properly control it and direct it. Personally I do like this theory more because it explains why wandless accidental magic is so common, but then once children actually learn how to direct and control their magic, wandless magic is so difficult for them to relearn. The wand is a crutch, but a useful one.

The unbeatable wand made, if rumors are true, by an aspect of creation. Sarcastic eyebrow raise,"No-one wants that kind of power."

Exaggeration happens on both sides of the argument. Example: curbstomp.

I feel like instead of it being an "asspull" it was an attempt to universe build. Whether is was a good or bad attempt doesn't really matter as she is essentially the Goddess of the HP Multiverse. We just play in the sandbox every once and a while.

** There are multiple interpretations that I like.

Wands and verbal spells can be seen as a sort of automatic focusing device.

One interpretation is that earlier magic was harder and weaker. People started creating magic focuses in order to make better use of magic. That leads to wand magic being both easier and faster with better results, with the downside that the moment you lose your wand you are basically helpless. Earlier types of magic, such as ritualistic magic and clunkier focuses, such as staves, can be used but are both slower and weaker than wand magic. But they can be used in emergency situations when you don't have access to wand magic. An excellent example of this is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7287278/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Forests-of-Valbon%C3%AB][Harry Potter and the Forests of Valbonë]].

​

Another interpretation (which, in my opinion, is more suited for AUs) is that wand magic is more convenient. As magic users formed villages, towns and cities, magical teachings became standardised. Magic focus production because more and more industrialised. Wand materials because more and more accessible. People no longer have to fear not matching with a wand. They no longer have to use sub-par wands, because the wand makers simply have so many of them. Everyday normal people no longer have any use for the volatile magics of old.

People, of course, still use them. But only in certain fields that require it and even then, only in small amounts.

A mastery of the old wandless arts is a mastery of magic itself. It allows for raw manipulation of magic. You can do literally anything you can imagine, if you have enough skill, experience and imagination, of course. It's incredibly dangerous. Magic is everything and should you misstep... it will consume you and everything around you. Magic doesn't obey, it follows. Bad things happen to those who try to force it.

Wandless magic requires incredible focus, the focus that is usually provided by a wand. Emotions play a big role in this, seeing as we, humans, tend to focus the most under extreme emotions. That's how accidental magic occurs. As children we lack the emotional control we gain as we grow up and as such, when a child feels intense emotions, magic responds.

Light and Dark magic, require their respective emotions in order to provide max output. A magic user will eventually get used to the magic they use. You could envision it as the magic needing to take a certain /path/ in order for it to work properly. Your mindset and your focus provide that path. Eventually, you will require less and less active thought for the magic to take it's /path/.

Here lies one of the gratest dangers to a mage. If you cast magic of certain similar /paths/ without care, your mind will start getting more and more stuck in those paths and the mindsets that require them. It will blind and bind you. Other types of magic will become harder and harder and eventually... impossible. A truly Dark Lord will find it impossible to conceive the "lighter" emotions, let alone cast the magic associated with them. A truly Light mage similarly will be unable to emphasise with the darker parts of society. They will be physically unable to conceive it. The more towards a side you fall, the less human you become.

And the worst of it all? Almost no one is aware that this sort of danger exists. Your mind will begin to slip towards one side or the other and you won't be able to notice. As such, there is almost no documentation, and the little that exists is ridiculed. You /need/ others that somehow know of this danger to warn you and save you in time.

People who only use wanded magic aren't safe from the dangers either. People accidentally empower their spells with wandless magic all the time when they feel heightened emotions. And after all, wanded magic is based on wandless. It simply bypasses the mental focus needed and compresses to effect to something easier visualised. That's why a lot of combat spells take the form of balls of light. That's how the creators chose to visualise it in order to make it easier for the casters to use it.

Again though, most people have no clue that /this/ is how magic works. You'll only find pieces of this theory from old arts users. Good luck with that, seeing as the old arts are completely banned in Britain :D (although some powerful families don't really care about laws all that much)

​

Have I given one perhaps a bit more thought than the other? I don't really have any suggestions for the second one, seeing as it's my own interpretation and I haven't written any fics (yet :P). If you like it, feel free to use any part of it in your own fics, I'd be honoured.

*** Your mind is both twisted and beautiful. I usually visualize magic in the various universes I dip into as being on an equivalent karmic exchange combined with the three fold rule. If i give my main character a power boost, their counterparts receive something similar or more deadly. To keep a proper balance. So when I have my hero suffer to gain power and knowledge its for a greater reason that eventually falls to them reaching their peak abilities in order to survive.

Op hero = Op villain/horror personified

Wands have always began, to me, as the governments way to control/standardize magic. In some cases to prevent exposure and others for reasons mostly lost to time. In either case wands were tools that weren't needed unless it was a wand focused field of study.

I just happen to have the right amount of misdirection for my hero that using a wand to focus their power wouldn't be exactly healthy for all the people around them. Think what Harry did to Olivanders on a massive scale.

All under the low low price of near character torture and finding equal rewards for that pain.

All that said, I believe wands are useful overall, but not the end all be all of magic. They are powerful tools/artifacts to help ease the lives of your everyday magical being.

How does that effects the light/dark or good/evil sliding scales? I don't know. I just love that I can ask the question and generate various different points that can answer it.

** I believe that wanded magic is vastly superior to any other form of magic presented in canon (wasn't there a story about how Rome conquered most of Europe because their wizards armed with wands destroyed the opposing druids, sages and other kind of magic users?).

Sure, a talented wizard could learn wandless magic, but it would necessite a lot of efforts that would be better used to learn another branch of magic, and the results would still be lacking compared to the same spells used with a wand. Summoning charm apart (which is a way to ensure you are never wandless), I don't think wandless magic is that interesting to learn outside as a hobby.

PS : Wouldn't several spell become unusable wandlessly? As an example, can a wizard potentially cast a wandless fiendyre (without melting his arm)?
