** I mean I undrstand i Sirius is punished by the school in some way and especially his friends.

But all this rubbish about it being murder is just stupid. Sure Snape calls it that, but the facts are different here.

If someone tells you were the keys to the lion cage are andyou steal them and open them. It's your dumb fault. Sure that other person should get in trouble, because he should tell such secrets, but it is reckless endangerment at worst.

Now the funny thing about the situation is, that in a legal way those you get in trouble would, of couse be, Remus (even if it is unfair because he did everything he could to keep people save, but the decks is set against him), and then Snape and ironically James, because they broke knowingly through the savety measurements of a werewolf lair and that sounds like a crime to me, if for no other reason because they could endanger other people aside from themselves.

Of all people on the list Sirius would be the last to facelegal consequences.

*** It doesn't work that way. If Snape died, Sirius would have been guilty of manslaughter. Snape didn't know Lupin was a werewolf. He thought he was sneaking after another school boy. The fact that he was out of bounds and there by choice, does not change the fact that Sirius knowingly set him up there. That charge could, if handled right by the accuser standards, even go up as far as first degree murder if the lawyer convinces the jury a werewolf is a mindless beast and as a human of no apparent mental health issues, Sirius must be hold accountable for the werewolf's actions.

Tldr; Snape was a fool but that doesn't absolve Sirius of his guilt.

**** But he did expect Lupin to be a werewolf, a theory he held for so long that his best friend Lily, got annoyed at just mentioning it.

So Snape knew or at least expected that he was walking into a werewolf lair. Now you could argue that he maybe expected some more security measures, but that is it.

Now of course Sirius lawyer had to argue that Snape was aware of the danger his choice to go there would pose and that is where Lily would come in. The question would be if she would be honest enough to say that yes Snape had annoyed her with that theory before or if she was spiteful enough to keep quiet and be part of a misjudgment and could put Sirius behind bars and Remus' life on the line. I think she would hate it but give a truthful account.

So it wouldn't be murder, but reckless endangerment that leaded to death.

***** That's manslaughter though. Death wasn't the goal but a likely outcome Sirius knew.

Either way, I think due to his minor status, he would at best receive a slap in the wrist, considering there doesn't seem to be a system in place to re-educate criminally-inclined youth. We know three underage cases: Newt, Hagrid and Harry. Harry's was bogus so I'll ignore it. Newt's case was also reckless endangerment, if I remember right, and that only led to expulsion. Hagrid's was manslaughter of Mrytle. His wand was broken and wand rights taken from him, which is serious but neither reformative nor an equivalent of a prison sentence.

So, I think, this all discussion is pointless. But fun.

***** From The Sword of Gryffindor on Pottermore

#+begin_quote
  There is a further allusion to Excalibur emerging from the lake when Harry must dive into a frozen forest pool to retrieve the sword in Deathly Hallows (though the location of the sword was really due to a spiteful impulse of Snape's to place it there), for in other versions of the legend, Excalibur was given to Arthur by the Lady of the Lake, and was returned to the lake when he died.

** Sirius only told Snape how to get past the Whipping Willow from what I remember, the rest is all on Snape. Had Remus gored Snape, it's Remus who would have been expelled ans sent to Azkaban (if not executed ). As for Sirius, he would have lost all his friends (doubt any would have forgiven him for Killing Remus ), would probably be expelled (if not for this event, Dumbledore would probably have found an excuse like past transgression or any mistake he would do in the futur ). There is also a pretty big chance for him to not be invited (and/or accepted ) in the Order.

But Azkaban is unlikely. No matter the intent, he only told him how to open a Secret passage. The responsability for the rest would fall on Remus for being there, on Snape for going near him and on Dumbledore for letting a werewolf near students.

** Nah, real world he would definitely be on the hook for it. The question is simply: as a matter of fact, did Sirius' actions cause Snape's death? And then a second question: as a matter of fact, did Sirius intend to cause Snape serious harm?

The answer to both of these questions would seem to be "yes", and I suspect a prosecutor could establish as much to a jury's satisfaction. You bring evidence of the antagonistic history between Snape and Sirius. You establish that Sirius knew that a werewolf was the other side of the passage. You establish that Sirius knew that Snape was curious about what was the other end of the passage and suspicious of Remus' disappearances. And then you prove that Sirius, on a full moon, told Snape how to get through the passage.

If you show those things, Sirius is definitely going down for something. If not murder, then attempted murder.

As for how you prove them, the same way you prove most things in court: witness evidence. One suspects that Lily's evidence would be key, as she was Snape's BFF at this time.

And Sanpe did the heavy lifting in putting himself in danger.

And Lily would say that he had a theory about Remus being a werewolf long before he went there. So she would actually be key to get Sirius off the hook.

** I've never seen a single fic where Sirius gets sent to Azkaban over that. He wouldn't, if only because he's a heir to a rich pureblood family, and Snape is a poor halfblood with nobody to stand up for him in the wizarding world. Remus would be screwed, though.

That's said, yes, it's definitely a murder attempt, and I'm appaled that people justify it just because they don't like the victim. Maybe if Sirius was punished for that, he would learn something about consequences and started to think before he acts.
