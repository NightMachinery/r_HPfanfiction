** /"Harry, Harry," said Lockhart, shaking his head impatiently, "it's not nearly as simple as that. There was work involved. I had to track these people down. Ask them exactly how they managed to do what they did. Then I had to put a Memory Charm on them so they wouldn't remember doing it. If there's one thing I pride myself on, it's my Memory Charms. No, it's been a lot of work, Harry. It's not all book signings and publicity photos you know. You want fame, you have to be prepared for a long hard slog."/

"Hard work like torturing people?" Ron shouted. "My dad told me only Ministry-trained Obliviators were taught that spell - he wouldn't say how they make sure no one else can learn it, but based on his expression, I'm guessing you had to do some pretty awful stuff to learn that spell. Don't pretend to be some sort of hero!"

Lockhart straightened from his trunk, twisting to face Ron with a surprised look on his face. "Mr. Weasley, you're showing an unexpected level of brilliance here. Pity you weren't able to harness that for class. /Colloportus!/" With a wave of his wand, the door to Lockhart's office closed and locked and Lockhart leaned back on his desk. "I hope you'll forgive the theatrics, my boys, but it's not often I get the chance to monologue. Still more than your average villain though, another benefit of Memory Charms!"

"You're quite correct Mr. Weasley, it's exceedingly difficult and rather...messy... to learn the Obliviate spell if you're not a Ministry-trained Obliviator. I'm not suited for that type of work, far too inelegant. So what does that tell you?"

"How did you get away with this for so long?" Harry asked. "If only Obliviators can learn the spell, shouldn't it be suspicious that a former Obliviator was doing all these things? Wasn't anyone asking questions?"

"Exactly! I knew from the beginning that I'd never be able to fully utilize my talent as an Obliviator while I was shackled to the Ministry's stiff regulations. So, Gilderoy Lockhart, master Obliviator, had to disappear and be replaced with Gilderoy Lockhart, professional dilettante."

"Honestly, as much as I enjoy my books, I think that was truly my greatest work. It took years - the trick, you see, is to not change too much at any one time, that's how you get caught. So I started by modifying my colleagues memories in small ways, convincing them I'd done a little less on cases then they thought. It wasn't long before they were all convinced I was useless as an Obliviator and just coasting in the department! Then I started to modify their memories of my name and my appearance - nothing much, just hair color or replacing a few syllables. I knew it was really working when people started giving me odd looks around the coffee machine! Once I was asked to leave the office for the third time, because it was a secured area and only Obliviators could be present, I knew I was reaching the endgame."

"Really, you'd think that people who modify memories for a living would be more on guard against it in their own life, but the Obliviators' Office was the easiest part of the plan! The Aurors, on the other hand, were a massive pain. I had to repeat the process, except I couldn't just eliminate myself from their memories entirely - first I convinced any Auror I'd worked with that I wasn't with the department but was instead with Magical Accidents and Catastrophes, /then/ I had to modify their memory to make me an outside contractor instead of with the Ministry. Only then could I change myself from someone who was actually doing work into a useless hanger-on, showing up at crime scenes trying to horn in on the glory. Truly an exhausting amount of work. Mad-Eye Moody alone took 6 months of repeated charms just to get him to forget that one time I came up behind him without warning!"

"Mad-Eye Moody?" Harry murmured to Ron.

"Some famously paranoid Auror. Dad says he's nearly impossible to get the drop on." Ron replied.

"Have I lost your attention boys? We can jump straight to the memory charms if you'd prefer!" Lockhart interjected.

"No, we were just saying that we didn't believe you could manage /any/ of that," Ron replied cooly. "You've been useless in class, hard to believe you could manage to get the drop on anyone, let alone a famous auror like Mad-Eye Moody!"

"What are you doing?" Harry hissed at him.

"Keeping him talking! You have any other bright ideas?"

"Ah, Mr. Weasley, thank you for the input. Truth be told, I feel I may have taken the 'helpless idiot' role a bit too far here at Hogwarts. In my defense, it was just too much fun. My memories of Professor Snape's face every time I opened my mouth will keep me entertained for years to come! Still, you make a fair point and I'll endeavor to moderate my character in the future. Now then, I think we've covered everything? Ready to be Memory Charmed?"

"Wait!" Harry shouted desperately. "Don't you have anything more to explain to us? You secret motivation? How that one singular event in your childhood shaped you into who you are today and drives everything you do?

"Harry, my boy," Lockhart tutted. "It's really not that complicated! I wanted to be famous and rich, but didn't want to put in the work. Combine that with an uncommon skill at Memory Charms and there was really only one answer. Now, I applaud your dedication to the trope, as well as saving your own skin, but really, I have places to be."

With that, Lockhart raised his wand. Harry began desperately reaching for his wand, but Lockhart drew his without any of the flourishes he displayed at the duelling club. "Oblivi-"

As Lockhart began the spell, the door into his office blew open, sending razor-sharp splinters howling into the room. Before they could reach any of them, however, they merged into a flowing stream of wood pieces that surrounded Lockhart, binding his arms to his sides and covering his mouth. A man hobbled through the now open door frame, moving surprisingly quickly considering his wooden leg and hunched stature.

Ron looked closer at the scarred face and eerily spinning blue eye of the man. "Wait a... aren't you Mad-Eye Moody? What are you doing here?"

"Saving your hide, looks like." Moody growled in return. "My name gets said three times, I get an alert. It's called a Taboo. Would've been here sooner, but all it told me was Hogwarts and I had to check on three other people in this blasted castle before I got to Lockhart."

"But..but-" Ron sputtered. "Why do you have a general Taboo on your name? Doesn't it drive you crazy? Aren't you getting warnings from the spell like, all the time?"

"Of course!" Moody yelled. "That's the point! People don't talk about me unless they're my enemies, boy. It's a lesson you'd do well to learn."

"Unless they're your friends, right?" Harry asked.

"Friends are just enemies who haven't stabbed you in the back yet, kid. Now, I managed to catch the tail end of that conversation and it sounds like Gilderoy here has been a very bad boy. I knew there was a reason I didn't like this tosser."

"Wait, that's right!" Ron said. "Why did you come to check on Lockhart? He said he modified your memory to make you not suspicious of him. Did he mess it up?"

"No, the idiot seems to have a talent for Memory Charms. But that's what tipped me off! The fact that I /wasn't/ suspicious of him, made me suspicious. Took years for that suspicion to pay off, and more than one trip overseas, but you know what they say - it's not paranoia if they're out to get you!"

*** I agree so much. I found a few! [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3695419/1/My-Gilded-Life]] [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6635363/1/When-In-Doubt-Obliviate]] [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8324961/1/Magical-Me]]

Its a shame most are self inserts where they take over his life but they do so well.

I found a great one though, chapters 190 and 191 and 192 seem to be the start of Lockhart bit. (Its a collection of stories. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2565609/190/]]
