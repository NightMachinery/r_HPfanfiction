** I outlined an ASIOF crossover before (without the Sansa romance) and there is one major conclusion. Coming from the 20th/21st century, Westeros would suck.

The issue with such a setting (Hermione spending a few years at Winterfell) is that there is no way she would be content to shit in a chamber pot, watch all her friends die from childhood diseases and so on. A form of limited industrialisation would be unavoidable and Hermione could easily pull it off with magic. Transfiguring a basic steam engine would be ridiculously easy, as would building anything up to basic trains and ships comparable to crude pre-WWI destroyers. Transfigure some basic microscopes (trial and error for the lenses) and outsource the basics of biology research. Do the same for basic electricity. Computers and even TVs would be out of her reach, but stuff like the telegraph and electric lighting would be easy to establish, even without magic.

And that's not even talking about the things you could rig up yourself with ease, like hot air balloons or the printing press.

The one way around this is to not give the protagonists (Hermione in this case) the opportunity to develop stuff, but to do that they need to be in the thick of the action, which would be with Robb, Stannis or Jon beyond the wall, not at Winterfell drinking tea with Sansa.

Also, Hermione would be very interested in creating a Navy just for the sake of +razing+ liberating Slaver's bay.

*** Indeed. Most GoT crossovers turn the HP characters into callous idiots who happily go along with an evil, fucked-up system instead of using their magic to force changes.

I'd be interested in any such story, relationship with Sansa or not, if it actually would show what happens if Hermione in her seventh year - fresh out of the war, with all her knowledge, all her morals, and, most importantly, all her drive - were in Westeros. None of that "yes, m'lord" bowing and scraping.

The girl who fought to free the elves most certainly wouldn't bow her head to nobles in Westeros. And, given her skills and HP magic's general level, Westeros cannot stop her. She can simply apparate, disillusioned, to whatever noble makes trouble, and rearrange their memories and personality as she did with her parents.

Burning people at the stake seems to be a Rhollor/Targaryen centred event in Westeros. No way anyone would dare suggest the stake in the North after Aerys burnt their Lord and his heir.

#+end_quote

Given that she is British, I doubt Hermione would insist on abolishing monarchies. Reforms for sure and parliamentarianism without a doubt (as well as ending serfdom and slavery), but she wouldn't be a democratic crusader like the 20th/21st century US.

#+begin_quote

Perhaps shadow magic could (or it could be countered by a Patronus, which would be anticlimactic and hilarious). And the Others would be quite a challenge. Although the army of the dead wouldn't be nearly as fearsome if your side has Great War artillery, flamethrowers and airships (all fairly easily created with magic).

Alternatively, imagine Bellatrix Lestrange dumped into Westeros. She'd usurp the Seven Kingdoms within a year.

The story I have outlined has Harry and Hermione thrown to Westeros AFTER Hermione has read GoT (came out in 1996) and she recognises some of the world. Shortly after Robert's Rebellion would be the best start, because it gives them more time to build a power base given the greater need to industrialise (to fight off the coming long night).

Recent examples would be Lybia, which has gone from an authoritarian regime with cruelty but working education/healthcare to a complete shithole torn apart by infighting and violence.

People like Tywin would have to go, but I doubt she would be against the Starks (especially after reading the first book). Dany would be an interesting plot point (unlike her brother), especially since she is a newborn and could be easily swayed.

The Other's might very well be immune to magic or only vulnerable to very few spells (like Dementors), so finding a counter for them other than "melee combat with Valyrian Steel" might be a challenge (if Valyrian Steel bullets don't work at least).

****** The biggest issues for industrialization are going to be the fuel materials. While it is shown that iron/steel are common, we don't see anything to suggest oil and coal are available in large amounts. This could be a major stumbling block. Not to mention the need for a lot of chemical processes. Those might be off-loadable to maesters and the like but it will be a slower process once the basics are done.

Not to mention lots of metallurgy. Just producing steel isn't enough. It has to be the right type of steel. Particularly for any kind of potential navy vessels. The effects of temperate and salt on steel can be devastating if it isn't created properly.

******* Luckily magic can fix that easily. You can transfigure anything into a pint of gasoline or a brick of Admiralty Coal and then duplicate it with magic (gemini charm). You also just need to tool one gun, one shell and so on. Magic makes industrialisation stupidly overpowered.

Harry and Hermione could easily build a tank in a few minutes (the engine and the rifling of the gun are the tricky parts, maybe the gearbox as well). Trial and error solve reliability issues, unbreakable charms or similar prevent wear. A simple fortress shouldn't take more than a day, a small warship a week.

****** Well, have her interact with Lyanna instead. Derail the entire civil war.

******* It all comes down to your interpretation of Lyanna from the books. If she ran away out of love, well try convincing a stubborn, independent 14/15 (?) year old girl that her "true love" is wrong for her.

If she was kidnapped you run into the issue to Jon's fate and the whole aftermath. Rhaegar is clearly not suited to rule after the stunt he pulled, Aerys II is completly mad, so joining the rebellion would be the only choice. And given Robert's obsession over Lyanna, I doubt that she would be happy.

Although an argument can be made that Robert would have been a decent king without the loss of his "true love". Not great, but decent. I mean, who wouldn't go drinking and whoring if they were married to Cersei?

You could fake Lyanna's death, but I doubt that Ned could pull that lie off once Robert starts his descent into alcohol. And you would need to reconcile Dorne to the Crown either way.

Tl;dr: Would be interesting, but keeping Lyanna alive is akin to opening Pandora's box.

******** Again, Hermione can do magic. If she cannot convince Lyanna that chasing Rhaegar is a bad idea despite demonstrating magic and "seer knowledge", she can go and mind wipe Rhaegar and Aerys and fix things that way. Or arrange accidents for them.

HP Magic is a hard counter to pretty much everything in GoT.

********* She can certainly kidnap Lyanna back, but she would have to find her first. And without having been there, apparation is not an option.

Also, if you could easily take over a country with mind control, Voldemort would have done so long ago. You can probably puppet one or two important people, but that wouldn't do the trick in the SEVEN Kingdoms. And just disposing the ruling elite wouldn't immediately solve the problem because there is a clearly established succession line for each of the realms (and it would take a lot of time to get there).

Also, while Hermione was fine to manipulate her parents memories to protect them, questionable as that was, I don't see her throwing Imperius curses around like they were going out of fashion. And Harry only uses them in a pinch/when he is pushed over the edge. I don't see him going along with such a plan either.

********** You don't understand - she can rearrange memories and personalities. Including things like "you always wanted to move to Australia". She doesn't need the Imperius - she can merely realign Tywin's memories with a desire to "do the right thing" or "Obey Robert's new law".

(Also, if Voldemort were the only wizard in the entire world, he would have taken over Britain easily.)

Kidnapping Lyanna? Again, why bother? Merely fix Rhaegar instead, and Aerys when you're at it. Apparition works as soon as you travel there - so, after a short buildup, she can cover the entire continent. And she has foreknowledge thanks to having read the book.

There's no bloody way she wouldn't rule the continent in a few years, tops.

*********** That would work if the Seven Kingdoms were a small, absolutistic realm and not a feudal one which takes six months to cross. It would take years to manipulate everyone who matters because you'd have to alter pretty much every Lord in the Seven Kingdoms, otherwise you'd have a rebellion on your hands. You could hold the North indefinitely, but if you want to spread the ideas of the declaration of human rights, you are looking at years of travelling just to mind magic everyone who matters.

************ I said, in a few years she is ruling the continent. And once she has done the travelling to key areas, she can apparate back and forth, so that's a good investment.
