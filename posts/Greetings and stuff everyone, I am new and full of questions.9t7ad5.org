I just wanted to introduce myself and maybe beg you guys for help. I write fanfiction, sometimes... When the stars are in their proper- alright, so its been a while. But, lately a story has been nagging me, I mean really hanging on for dear life. It's even been interrupting my sleep so I'm trying to get back into the swing of things. I wanna take a swing at HP fanfics again and so I come to you guys looking for feedback, suggestion and maybe (mostly) advice, especially on lore.

​

So merry met everyone!!


** My best advice: There's a lot of weirdly spelled names in the HP fandom. Double check the spelling of everyone's names. lol

** Hey! Welcome, I'm doing the story rough draft to my first fic as well, however I think this place is great, everyone gives solid advice and is super helpful. They're nitpicky about certain details, sure, mainly just americanisms in the British potterverse, which I think is fair. But they're all super nice about it.

I am just finishing Not From Others which is a 7th year fic from Ginny's POV and it's amazing, really hit me emotionally and got me invested. It made me cry yesterday I was so deep into it, so I'd strongly recommend it!

** Hi. Welcome!

If you get back into the swing of writing and post your stuff here, keep in mind that some of us can be pretty critical, but it is (usually) in a constructive manner.

Depending on what kind of HP fanfiction you like, there's also some common and popular tropes that are not very well received (sometimes despised) in this community.

Or some AU action? linkffn(Heartlands of Time; Bungle in the Jungle).

** This might sound silly, but please properly capitalise your title (well use proper capitalisation in general). I honestly don't care if you use British or UK spellings, but using UK terminology is very important because it is part of the world building (i.e. trainers not sneakers, etc). Lastly, write a good summary. It is the best thing you can do for your fic. It also helps you think about what is important and how you conceptualise your story.

From my perspective, I think a likely reason people were downvoting you is because you were saying things like "how do writers do this, it took me half an hour" about simple things like formatting and capitals. Well, firstly, they do it as they go along. With practice your writing will get better and you will have to spend less time going back and fixing stuff. And secondly, half an hour isn't really a long time. People here take writing seriously and go through several drafts. Your attitude made it seem like you couldn't be bothered- controversially I don't think there is anything wrong with this. It's fanfic, no one is paying you and it should be for fun, so spend as much or little time as you want on it. But be prepared for those who take it more seriously to be less than impressed, especially if you are specifically asking for their help.

******* Yeah, but as Floreat is saying, you didn't bother with basic grammar and formatting in a writing subreddit. That's not a very good look. Compounded by the fact that it seemed to be more out of laziness than anything else. Then there's the whole 'there I fixed it it took FOREVER' which is two fold. One, it implies you knew it was wrong because you were able to fix it, which further supports general laziness for not doing it in the first place. And the implication that 'forever' (when the time between posts certainly wasn't 'forever') to edit 2000 words is....problematic.

Then you have posts calling it 'exclusionary' because people use capital letters. You're not Hemingway or Joyce or Beckett. You have not earned the ability ignore basic grammar and get away with it.

Grammar in writing is akin to your first impression in real life. If the first thing I see from you is a lack of interest in basic structure or formatting or grammar, why should I bother reading it?

I can only imagine the amount of profanity [[/u/rpeh]] would send my way if I sent him something to read that ignored basic grammar and structure. Granted, his response would probably be, "Wait you don't do that anyway?"

But a beta does not exist to fix your writing. You need to fix your writing. The beta should exist to give it a second pair of eyes, to see if themes are working as you intend them to, and to catch the shit you miss. Wanting them to do it all for you isn't what their purpose is. And again, seems lazy on the part of the writer.

The whole excessive use of double negatives and trying to sound like Applejack aside, most writers despise laziness. And even more so when it's laziness pertaining to their hobby, or in some cases of the people you'll meet on this sub, their livelihood.

I myself am paid to write. That means I probably look at writing in general a lot differently than most people. Multiple times, and this very well may not be your intention, but with your style this is how a reader preceives it, you whine about writing being difficult.

No shit? Writing is hard? Who'd a thunk it. Writing is a skill cultivated by determination and practice. Do you think Stephen Curry would take kindly to you standing next to him and missing a three pointer then if he offered you shooting advise to whine and say 'well it's just hard for me!'

Sure, now, a full fifteen years since I started really writing, I can sit down and shit out an essay on a random topic that intrigues me in a couple of hours. But I sure as shit couldn't do that when I started writing.

When I realized I liked writing, after writing things that I'm sure were terrible but have since been lost to time, I read about writing. I read about literary theory. I took classes on writing. I reread books by authors I liked and tried to analyze style. And then, most importantly, I wrote. I wrote a lot.

You're not me. Which is probably a good thing. That might not be how you process and function. But never once did I look for an excuse or use the difficulty of it all as a scapegoat.

I read your first thread, looked at the story, saw the terrible formatting and went on my merry way. I didn't up or downvote because I don't care. But what I typed here is the impression I, a rather experienced writer, got from your own words. And really, the only positive thing I can say about it is that you tried. Everyone's first writings suck. The only way to get better is to keep doing it.

But you will not improve if you can't be arsed into typing with proper grammar.

******** that's /my/ point though! this /isn't a writing sub./ it's a fanfiction sub! it's not like some professional elitist cliche writer's club workshop! it's a fanfiction subreddit. at least that's all i thought it was. but then you guys come on me all like, gotta use that grammer, gotta use those letters, this is so shameful, this is horrific, this is so laaaazy. what the fuck?

that's my point. how the fuck do you guys even expect me to want to stay here and learn to be better if you're just gonna get on my case the second i post here, no matter how my story looks? it's /my first story!/ that's my point. my first story, and you guys shit over it cause it's not up to your writer's club high standards. it's not /gonna be/ up to your standards because i'm not a fucking elite writer! i'm a 14 year old girl who's never written shit in her life, and i don't even got the time to write! i got homework, i got chores and shit to do. i just came in here looking to have fun trying out writing a story. that's all. and i thought you'd be all chill about it! but you aint chill. you're snobby and arrogant and pretentious.

i'm not looking to be the next stephen king or whatever. but you guys all seem to think you already /are/, and you can be super crazy critical of people who yeah, maybe don't care on the same level as you do about it. fuck. why are you guys so damn serious and intense about it?

like i said. didn't even think this was some professional writer's workshop to begin with! i thought it was just some hpfanfic reading and writing site. like. casual. fun. you know? but no. you guys are all elitist asses about it. you're all so good and talented you gotta shit on peeps who don't got half the skill you do, or the same drive or whatever.

is that really a bad fucking thing? that i'm just a girl who wants to try writing outta curiosity? for the fun of it? i don't wanna be all furious editing long hour workshop stuff. so what? shouldn't that be cool with you? with anybody? i just wanted to dip my toes in here, not full on throw myself into grueling cement breaking work.

like do you get that? please? i didn't come here for some rocky training montage to become a super awesome high class writer lady. i just wanted to have a little fun, get a bit of tips, that's it. is it really wrong not to want anything more then that?

yeah it took me forever in my opinion. /because i haven't done it before!/ the point shouldn't be the issue. yeah it was hard for me, because /it was my first time doing that./ of course it was. but you guys don't want to give me that? you don't want to cut even a inch of slack here? seriously?

********* Here's a dirty little secret about writing. It's very inside baseball and something a large chunk of people don't want you to know.

You can do it.

The only thing preventing you from doing it is you. A negative attitude of perpetiual failure will lead to perpetual failure. There is nothing preventing you from improving but your own attitude. There's plenty of free resources available online to learn. I'm pretty sure the entirety of Strunk and White's Elements of Style is available in PDF for free online.

You've said you're. A lot of who you'll be dealing with on here are adults. The 'woe is me' 'I can't do it' sob story is cringe worthy because it is nothing more than an excuse Go look in the mirror and tell yourself you can do it. Because you can. Don't ever, under any fucking circumstance, for any fucking reason, say you can't do it again.

But you will have to thicken the skin, as it were. Even here you say 'I just wanted tips!' but after you got them, whined about internet points and how that made things harder. That's a terrible attitude to have about anything.

Now writing is a skill that needs to be developed and nurtured. A lot of youth have a romanticized vision of writers sitting around in some idyllic paradise and then just magically writing down pristine copy. That is utter bullshit.

Lets compare it to another skill. Let's say, cooking, If I were teaching you how to cook, it would be incredibly irresponsible of me to say, let you serve raw chicken and then act surprised when it poisoned people. Your story is currently the raw chicken. There's nothing preventing you from baking it in an oven. And I doubt you'd ever say 'well I can't do that it's too hard I just don't get it!'

Writing works the same say. The assumption when you put something on the internet is that you want commentary or review. The bane of the internet comes in the anonymous nature of it all. I have to assume you have at least a basic knowledge of what you're doing. Like at a restaurant, I must assume the chef knows that the poultry needs to be cooked. So I can say 'this chicken is raw' and have that have meaning to the chef. If you don't have the basic knowledge to understand such commentary, then a lot of basic commentary is going to seem more negative than it is. Of course it's problematic if someone says, "that's a fragment" and you don't know what that means.

Of course, not having knowledge of grammar isn't surprising. God knows they teach it for shit in schools. I've often argued that I didn't properly learn English grammar until I learned Latin in college because the professor was smart enough to know that the high school education on it was lazy and that it was essentially to properly understanding Latin.

Any community is going to assume a basic level of knowledge from people in it. Don't be offended when they use terminology that you don't understand. Ask for clarification. Saying 'I don't know," and even worse, using it as a justification, is the laziest thing on the planet. Made even worse by the Google era where answers to virtually any question are at your fingertips.

Calling people elitist assholes because they expect proper grammar in writing is akin to calling people elitist assholes because they expect you to not crash a car into them on the road. It is the most basic staple of writing.

As for slack cutting. Never ask people to hold you to a lower standard than they hold themselves. If you constantly get breaks there's never any incentive to improve. Of course, it doesn't seem like you really want to hone a skill all that much. I myself can't imagine wanting to do something as tireless or thankless as writing and posting a story without also improving my own ability. But that very well could just be some weird quirk of my own.

To not be wholly negative. The responses here and the short bit of story do reflect solid voice in the writing. It's not nearly as mechanical as a lot of first attempts. And voice can be a very difficult thing to develop. So that, as a whole there, is a good start.

*********** Well let's take that last reply. If I was your editor, this is how I'd reformat it to obey some basic rules of grammar while also trying to retain your "voice" as an author:

--------------

Ok. Thank you. I do want to learn. I want to get better. I do want to hone the skill and stuff. I want to write. Sorry I called people assholes and stuff. I'm not lazy. I won't say I can't do it, but I was taught it wasn't wrong to say "I don't know" when you really don't know. And I really don't know grammar or paragraph stuff, so that's just different with you and me I guess.

Anyway it's just frustrating and confusing, 'cos I did fix it but then I got told to put it back how it was by someone else.

So what am I supposed to do? Who do I listen to with that? Keep it how it is or put it back? Could you tell me how it's supposed to be?

--------------

It's important to note that what I just posted isn't perfectly grammatical, nor is it meant to be. I put capitals in the correct places and broke it into paragraphs where that seemed appropriate, and I replaced "cause" with "'cos", as it's used more often than "'cause", but YMMV on that one.

The result is hardly different from your original post but doesn't make me want to gouge my eyes out when reading it. Capitals and paragraphs are important because they break text up so it can be read more easily.

Some very basic rules are: 1) A new sentence should always begin with a capital letter. 2) Proper Nouns (names and so on) should always use capital letters 3) Doesn't apply to this post, but when writing dialogue, lines from different speakers should always go on new lines. 4) There are no hard and fast rules with paragraphs but generally it's a good idea to start a new one when you're moving on to a different topic or direction.

Hope that helps.

Hilariously my own 'paragraph structure' is pretty much 'this one looks too long, let's break it in half'. So whenever people ask me 'while how do you know when to do new paragraph! I uh...just do it when I feel like it.

*********** There isn't anything wrong with saying you don't know. No knowledge can be gained without first understanding the lack of knowledge. But the problem comes when it becomes an excuse. Lack of knowledge does not invalidate criticism. Wrong, with or without knowledge, is still wrong. Saying 'I don't know' without following it up with 'but I can go look it up!' is asinine to me.

I can't help without seeing both versions. I'm making an assumption based off of general commentary here that I probably only saw the second one and never the first.

I am more than willing to provide feedback if you want to send things to me, but I can't really answer your specific question here without some more context. I know [[/u/rpeh]] gave some general paragraph advice below as well.

Grammar is weird in that, well, it's....sort of...optional. But not in the way most people assume when someone says optional. A quick example would be that sometimes it's okay to use fragments or run-on sentences. That can be a stylistic choice. However if a seven sentence paragraph has six fragments in it, it's going to read choppily and disjointed and I'm going to assume the author doesn't know what a proper sentence is.

But before you can get to the point where you can ignore grammar you have to know grammar. And to be able to articulate why you're choosing to ignore it.

But there's also a lot of terrible writing advice out there. Like never starting a sentence with a conjunction or ending one with a preposition. Both are utter bullshit. But, without understanding what a conjunction or preposition is you can't understand why.

The gent rolls his eyes and replies "Do you know you should never start or end a sentence with a preposition?"

The American replies, "Gee you're right. Sorry 'bout that. Where's St. Paul's Cathedral at, asshole?"

Or as Churchill is reputed to have said, "Ending a sentence with a preposition is something up with which I will not put."
