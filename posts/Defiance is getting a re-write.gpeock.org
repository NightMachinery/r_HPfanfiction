  Memories are tricky things. Sometimes, they cause us to lose nights of sleep. Sometimes, they bring light to darkness. Sometimes, they change the course of destiny. Set after the events of Fourth year. Follow Harry Potter as he finds his way across his strange problems, his notoriety and of course, the resurrected dark lord trying to kill him. AU. Powerful! Harry, Harry/Daphne.

  Memories are dangerous things. You twist them and you turn them until you know every touch and corner, but you'll find an edge to cut you still. Twisted between his very own mind and a resurrected dark lord, Harry Potter is on the clock. Great men rise from desperate beginnings, and Harry is playing the most desperate game of them all. Set after 4th year. AU.

** It's not a rewrite as I understand it. It's an entirely new story that will borrow elements from defiance.
