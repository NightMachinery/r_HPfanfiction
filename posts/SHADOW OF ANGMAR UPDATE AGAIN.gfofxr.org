*** The story is not set within the time period of LotR, so you won't run into characters or many locations in common.

Knowledge of the larger Tolkien lore helps you appreciate the story more as you catch references to characters and events which form part of the backstory/history to the events of LotR. But it's by no means necessary.

To be honest, a casual LotR fan is probably in the same situation as someone who has never consumed any LotR media on that front - the references are to things you will only know about if you have read material about the second age/early third age of Middle Earth (LotR takes place at the end of the third age).

All that said, the LotR movies are always worth a watch if you haven't seen them yet. Although they won't give you useful /information/ that you need, they will impart the world's aesthetic which is no small thing.

If all that seems a bit much, then I would highly recommend watching this 5 min prologue:

** Am I the only one who didn't like these last two chapters? There was an undefined timeskip and a complete lack of the main character's development during that timeskip, including what he did/can do now that he's got a wand again.

Adding to this, this weird new war between dwarves and elves(?) against orcs from Gundabad is extremely strange, as there is no setup for it or even a location of where they are or where they're going or who the characters are or why it's even fought.

It went from "cool middle earth adventure" to "Harry is now a background character to these people you've never met before fighting a war you don't know the reason for". The last coherent bit of the story was when he made the wand, from there it just became... stuff? slice of life, except not?

What happened in the years we didn't see? Who is anyone? Why are they fighting, and why does Harry care/help?

*** This is useful feedback, and if the various comments I've seen so far are any indication, you're not the only person to feel this way.

I understand the concern, as the time-skip was something I wrestled with for a long time. In the end, I went through with it because the alternative involved many much smaller time-skips, which I was worried would end up feeling even more disjointed and confusing. The story already has a problem with its ever-rolling cast of characters who turn up, wander around for a couple of chapters, then disappear never to be seen again. The time-skip allows me to focus much more on a more contained moment in time, and actually develop some side-characters who are not Elves.

That said, I have tried to keep the story reasonably located in time, particularly with the interlude. The specifics of the amount of time that has past is not especially unimportant, though. More than 100, less than 1000 should be a good enough understanding for people who aren't all that interested in the setting. I have also mentioned a few times that the Valley in which they were encamped was the one where Harry fought Scatha shortly before the time-skip. This may not have been clear enough.

I guess I can see where the complaint about Harry being a 'background character' comes from despite the fact that this confused me when I first read it. I guess this is because Harry is not the one driving the war, creating the plans and leading the armies? He's one person among many, and he's not as prone to forcing others to listen to him as some of the other actors in the war-councils. That said though, he's still the main character, there's just more people around him than there were previously. That doesn't make him background, does it?

'Who is anyone' is the eternal problem of this story, and one I'm trying to fix through the time-skip.

I guess I'd hoped that Harry's general fondness for Dwarves, and his feeling of owing a debt to the line of Durin after the unpleasantness with the Balrog would explain his willingness to throw in in a war to avenge the death of another of that line outside the gates of Moria. Perhaps that does not make it into the actual written words, however.

Not exactly. But if your story has many, many paragraphs where it's implied that the main character is just sort of standing around silently in the background while listening to others talk it shifts the focus away from them.

Additionally, there was a change in the narrator - where before, the Narrator was a third force, it was still connected to Harry's POV and drew from his inner self instead of being totally seperate like now.

Harry has gone from a "he tought" character to an "it looked like he was" character, if you get what I mean.

This was really jarring for me personally, as it basically removed the story's protagonist and turned him into any other character. Not in a content sense, but in a narrative sense.

Take for example the scene in the beginning where he brews the explosive trap for the Wargs and then compare it to the scene where they plan the attack. You have paragraph after paragraph of war planning and bickering between people you

1. Don't know

2. You can't categorize

3. have no attachment to

Meanwhile, in the explosive trap scene, you have the narrator draw from what Harry is thinking and considering even when the POV is on the elven lady who shadows him.

It would have been much better if the narrator had access to Harry's inner monologue on the various dwarf lords for instance - as each says something interesting but ultimately meaningless, Harry reminisces on their history/personality and how it relates to the war they're planning, only to eventually butt in when it seems to dissolve into fighting.

That would keep the focus on the protagonist while not making him omipotent or making everyone else an idiot, and it would give some context for who the hell anyone is. For example, I only knew Thrain because Thorin says that's his ancestor in the Hobbit, but for the others I have no idea beyond that they "maybe" are from a specific clan or mountain range.

***** These are very valid concerns as they're something I've gone back and forth on a lot in the run up to writing these most recent chapters.

Harry's power level is much higher after the time skip than it was before, but I didn't want to simply drop all the changes in big old chunks of exposition. So the plan is to tease them out more gradually, so that each change can be given the space it needs to breathe.

It's a different problem to what I had in the first section, where Harry was gradually progressing in real time as it were. Here there's a big backlog of changes that I didn't want to roll out all at once for fear of creating too large a discontinuity after the skip.

Perhaps I went too far in the other direction, however.

The lack of Harry's internal narrative telling USA details about characters had a similar motivation of not wishing to overwhelm. Perhaps if I rectify that by adding some more discourse to the existing chapters, that will be sufficient for now. As the next chapter is meant to have some much more significant details on his new abilities.

****** (I'm consolidating several different topics from throughout the thread, to make it easier for me to comment.)

As an alternative data-point, I enjoy the partial mystery. Very often in fanfiction everything is already known to the reader, with the plot often being a slight rehash of canon and almost all of the characters and their characterisations directly transplanted from canon (or fanon --- e.g. Daphne Greengrass). That's not to say there's anything wrong with familiarity --- I greatly enjoy it myself and is probably why I read fanfiction --- but to put a scale on it (0-1), usually in fanfiction familiarity is at, say 0.7-0.9, while in Shadow of Angmar it's more like 0.3, which is refreshing.

To be fair, I was slightly disorientated in the new "section" after the interstitium, but then in non-fanfiction works I'm also often slightly disorientated at the start of a new book in a series (who are all these new people?). I don't think there's anything wrong with disorientation provided it eventually goes away. As a comparison, when travelling as a tourist it's also fun to visit places completely different from home.

As for the time-skip itself --- GRRM didn't do one and we can see the consequences --- so I'll happily take the time-skip. :) (I had guessed that we'd see occasional retrospectives, and it's nice (but not at all necessary) to see it confirmed.)

Regarding emotional affect: the presence of Harry, Elrond's sons and Thrain, as well as my conviction that, yes, obviously the Misty Mountains should be rid of orcs (sorry Orcs' Welfare Society), so I definitely should care about any endeavour to achieve that, was sufficient to remain emotionally engaged.

Since your adaptation of Middle Earth is amazing (and feels faithful to the original) it's always nice to see more of it, and more new characters.

This is all obviously not to say that the points of view you're replying to, are not also valid.

****** Definitely agree that you went a bit too far in the other direction.

And hell, I agree - this is the perfect opportunity for you as an author to create the "Period of Mystery" (as I call it personally) needed for the ability to convincingly pull random abilities from your ass, And I also understand not wanting to destroy the reader by dropping a titanic chunk of exposition on them, but perhaps that could have been alleviated by making the timeskip smaller.

You say anywhere between 100-1000 years (There's a problem with that, too - humans change their minds /quickly/ if you have that sort of timescale. There'd be a difference between 100 years and 110 years), and that's just too fuzzy of a frame. At 10 years after the wand he might be moderately proficient, but at 100 years he'd be halfway up to a Dumbledore, and at 200 years he'd /easily/ surpass him.

(Just read that it's 900 years. That's a hard bar to reach. Based on what we know about other wizards who are that old, he should easily be on the level of the other wizards)

An indication of his power could have been given through description - you could, for instance, describe his appearance. You're an amazing writer in the descriptive sense, you could easily convey a sense of power through a physical or even metaphysical description.

I think my major problem is simply that the dysjunction is so jarring. I find myself unsuspending my disbelief - there is zero magic use I could glimpse from the two chapters since the wand, when there should have been /something/, even just an aura of power or respect or even fear. People cringing back or subconsciously parting in his way. Just some indication of the time passed and arcane mastery achieved.

As for the exposition brick dropped if you do a HarryPOV, consider this:

--------------

Harry looked at the Dwarven Lord - really looked. His beard was fuzzy, evidence of the trek to this valley, but still expertly braided. His eyes, though tired, still blazed with the kind of righteous fury that could only be seen in those of a dwarf.

Thrain, his brain supplied. Lord of Erebor. It was small for a dwarven city, built in the roots of only a single mountain, but there were riches untold underneath the city. As Dwarves tend to do, they dug ever deeper into the earth, uncovering ever denser veins. There did not seem to be an end to Erebor's fortune, yet this did nothing but instill a sense of wyrd foreboding in Harry.

Nothing lasted forever, after all. The world /always/ took its due.

--------------

This is obviously written in my style, but that's how I'd alleviate the problem. It would give us at once the transcendent narrator back, while also providing context as to who these people are and why we should care about them.

***** This is sort of what I find most jarring. It's moved from third person close point of view non-omniscient narration to third person non-POV narration. This is problematic. I'm interested in Harry and his character and struggle; this particular war isn't that important to me. (And I still wish we had gotten more of a sense of what happened in the months after he first fashioned his wand. **THAT SAID**, I love this story. Steelbadger, please don't take any such criticism the wrong way! You're wonderful. Keep writing!

(Edited to add:) BTW, my fave bit in the two new chapters was Harry's reunion with Daewen. That's close PoV and you get an impression of what's going through Harry's head there. In that sense, it's much more like the rest of the story was up to this point.

I know that you're planning a three (?) part story, and I wonder if splitting them up would be wise. End with that nicely done epilogue from the rohirrim's perspective, then start a new story with a prologue that bridges the gap a bit more?

**** The first (and only) scene with Saruman was an echo of what should have been after crafting the wand.

The best passages are the ones where Harry either experiments with his magic, channeling it through the Staff, or makes potions - but that's not ever touched on again. You get vague references to things he's done during the skip, and the strange retrospective in "memory passed into myth", which I really think should have been in the previous chapter.

For instance, we see many strange things in the /world/ Middle Earth, explored through the Hobbit, Lord of the Rings or even the Silmarillion, yet stories like this inevitably focus exclusively on the characters instead of equally on both like the mythos did. It just seems so uninspired when you harp on for seven chapters about how the only bit of magic he can do is potions but then /don't have him experiment with those potions/.

I'd have liked to see what Kingsfoil for instance does as an ingredient. Is it too arrogant, too regal to mix with anything else, being like Dittany, which can only be distilled into an essence? Does it function as a support role in potions, making them unbelievably powerful, but only when handled correctly? Does it require the hands of a Dunedain or one of Isildur's bloodline to harvest correctly?

Or how about the Mallorn? They're obviously highly magical, what would one of their golden leaves do? Could you use a branch of it as a wand wood, or even a wand core? Could such a pure wood be paired with the darkness of a LotR dragon's heartstring?

You don't need to go Archmage of Arda - levels of powerwank, but a crossover should /always/ work to merge the two worlds in the ways allowed by the prose.

***** These are all things I want to do, but because of the time skip need to do somewhat retrospectively. Over the course of his ~900 years in Middle-earth, Harry had indeed learned a lot, but I can't just info dump it. The plan is to spread it out a bit so that each thing can be appreciated on its own.

The alternative of not having the skip would have naturally eased this issue, but also introduced another as these lessons would have been learned over a great span of years and the narrative would have suffered under the weight of multiple time skips.

Hopefully you'll stay with me long enough to explore these things!

****** Definitely feel like multiple timeskips would have been better. As I said in my other comment, the Period of Mystery is a good thing, but there were some plot-vital moments in those years, and I can't help but be disconnected from the plot if you go about gradually clearing up this timeskip.

Because let me guess - Harry definitely formed some new friendships and had people die and fought wars and all these fantastic things, and you'll give them as offhanded remarks or try to start relationships in the middle. I can only feel that this would be a mistake.

There are stories which begin seemingly in the middle - in this fandom especially, there is one that springs to mind: the one where Harry finds that ancestor vault. It starts somewhere in the middle of the plotline, and this can never be done truly well.

I hope you have a plan that's not just to throw things at us we have no context for, and/or only providing exposition as vague dialogue or offhanded remarks.

***** It's possible that the disappointment stems from the fact that fashioning the wand and reacquiring access to his magic seems to be his prime goal for most of the story and there is a huge buildup up to that point. It's a pivotal moment in the story. However, once we are past that point, nothing really changes that justifies that buildup. It sort of fizzles out. I understand he doesnt want Harry to be absurdly OP and change history willy nilly. But there is ought to be some significant character development directly because of having acquired a wand. I hope Steelbadger has a course correction soon because it's still one of the few high quality fics out there.

****** That may just be it, actually. The main goal for ~26 chapters was acquiring a wand, and he went to extreme lengths to get one - travelling the land swarming with orcs on the vague mentions of a Wizard; battling a Dragon - one of the most fearsome monsters capable of actually being killed by mortals - and when he finally, finally gets it... there's a time skip. No experiments. No interactions with anyone. No conversations with Elrond on the nature of magic, or the way the wand functions, or even another encounter with Saruman where he backshadows the old blood wand.

We didn't even get to see his first interaction with /Gandalf/, for gods sake. Even Saruman was a bit OOC in his extreme lack of interest, but that can be excused by the time difference - Gandalf, though, is another story. It's just sort of thrown in offhandedly. There's no conversation about what magic means. No sage advice by the millennia old wizard for the new guy. We just skip past all the interesting bits to a war we have no reason to care about. And even there, our MAIN CHARACTER barely acts or even says anything.

I'm holding on to see if this arc will be plot relevant in any way beyond when he eventually encounters the party journeying to Erebor.
