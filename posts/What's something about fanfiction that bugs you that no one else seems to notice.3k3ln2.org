Depends. If they manage to make him a good, compelling villain - that would be something I would really like to read. After all, raw knowledge and bravery against refined strategy of a unique mind... That's a quite good claim for success.

***** I could see a turn in Ron after the department fiasco.

Maybe Ron uses that as a wake up call and studies a little harder. Nothing super different. Just enough because he starts reflecting on the last years.

And maybe he 'realizes', because he's clever but not motivated in canon, that he's better. Or he's disgruntled.

*** I noticed on the thread breaking down pairings and listed characters in fanfic the other day that Ron was behind most other characters and barely beating the OC character option. It's kind of BS since in my opinion Ron was more important that Hermione. Hermione was smart and helped solve problems but Ron was Harry's best friend. Harry barely even liked Hermione without Ron around.

** I've come to hate "occlumency shields".

They just don't make sense. Having these "shields" would just announce that you are hiding something.

Do you think Voldemort would just let Snape hide information for him? Or would destroy Snape's mind looking for every piece of knowledge he had?

Basically any occlumency that lets someone know you're using occlumency sounds like a really bad idea if you don't want to be tortured. You'll probably die very quickly, but they are far less likely to find your secrets if you hide that you /have/ information, rather than hiding the information itself.

*** I don't hate "occlumency shields" in general, but I loathe them when they're portrayed as the absolute pinnacle of mind magic. I'd say they're acceptable (maybe even interesting) if they feature as failed attempts at Occlumency, or the pre-novice step, and they might even be considered useful in a combat situation, for example.

The worst thing, though? When everyone learns Occlumency. We're told that it's rarer than Legilimency, even. The only reason that Dumbledore, Voldemort, Snape and Bellatrix knew them was probably because they were also among the most skilled and learned wizards in canon.

In fact, unless a fic has a very unique premise to go along with it, I pretty much just quit reading as soon as Harry gets to Hogwarts and makes slightly different friends / is sorted in a different house / randomly starts acting differently.

They never really noticed her resourcefulness, determination or cunning. Who would've thought that the Gryffindor who belonged in Ravenclaw, was once named Slytherin?

** I ^{nope} out of fics the moment the author starts in on any Christian/othercrazyreligious-centric viewpoints and/or attempt to convert. I've seen this done in both Slytherin and Gryffindor ways; sometimes it is a subtle undertone that isn't entirely obvious at first, and other times it is as though the bible/book of mormon/etc. is being whacked upon my head by the author. I'm not sure if most people consider critiquing something like religion in a review a taboo, but it irritates me more than you can believe, and I nope the f*ck out as quickly as possible.

Contrary to this opinion, if someone makes some kind of really well thought-out reasoning for wizards to be celebrating traditional "pagan" holidays, /but doesn't turn it into a giant circle-jerk/proselytizing session,/ I'm willing to continue to read. Examples include; magic being more "powerful" on certain days of the year, etc. (I assume they study Astrology for reasons other than being able to name the stars in the sky)

*** Magical holiday rituals are going to be playing an increasingly larger role in my fic, "The Power of Love," due to the religious beliefs and practices of a particular group. Those beliefs aren't shared by all magicals, and not even all members of that group have the exact same beliefs. Although I describe very real and significant effects of the rituals, I'm going to try to avoid saying which, if any, of the explanations are true... even if the obvious one is most likely.

Regardless, none of them are my beliefs. All of the elements of the rituals come from mythology, ancient practices, and contemporary practices, but put together in my own way. I've always felt that there hasn't been enough fanfics that explore the idea that if the magical world had any sort of religion, it would likely lean towards ancient pagan practices (and, again, I'm not pagan, so no proselytizing here). Off the top of my head, "Beltane Child" is the only one that really tries and succeeds.

I've seen far too many fics where people try and make the Malfoys seem good by explaining away their pure blood prejudice as them just wanting to protect the traditonal wizarding way of life from muggleborns who won't integrate.

I don't think it's unreasonable that there would be a faction within the wizarding world that is against muggles/muggleborns for those reasons and i'm not opposed to fanfics that explore that.

My problem is with fics that use that as a way of justifying Voldemort and his followers actions, when fear of muggles was never a factor in their specific ideology.

Hermione is plain in the books - she only looks pretty once she's got her hair "tamed" and gets dolled up a bit. Otherwise, she's no beauty. Ron and Harry are average too, in the looks department. I'd have to say most of the main characters aren't winning any prizes in beauty...lol.

Only some characters are said to be explicitly good looking (or were), like Sirius, Bellatrix, Lily Evans, the Patil twins, Fleur, Ginny, Bill, Lockheart...
