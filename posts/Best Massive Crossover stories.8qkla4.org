** [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/HarryPotterAndTheNotFatalAtAllCulturalExchangeProgram][Harry Potter and the Not-Fatal-At-All Cultural Exchange Program]] crossover with fate Stay night, Harry on a battle Royal with his characterization fun and on point.

A Holy Grail War is brewing... but this is not your usual Holy Grail War. In this universe, the Masters and their Servants are converging on England to do battle. Nobody is quite sure where such a potent artefact came from - not the Church, not the Iranians, not the Japanese, not the mercenary, not the thrall of Voldemort, not the werewolves - but everyone has something they want out of it, and one Harry James Potter gets involved when he accepts the invitation in order to save Sirius Black during the events at the end of [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheOrderOfThePhoenix][/Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix/]]. Now part of this fracas, it's up to him and his Servant to step up to the bat and win... or die trying.

*** Oooo! Someone recommended one of my fics! Thanks! I do have to get back to that story eventually... it's hard to write sometimes when your inspiration moves onto other things.

**** I read a bunch of your storys, I quite like your latest crossover with DxD and your co-story with shadow is one of the best crossovers with Percy Jackson.

I am quite looking for your new RWBY crossover that you asked ideas about Harry´s weapon or your fable Harry/Luvia xD

***** Thank you so much. DxD I haven't worked on in a while. I'm actually not very happy with it. I feel like I've changed a lot as a writer since I started it and there were a lot of things I'd change if I could. I sort of wanted to scrap it and rewrite it but shadowz101 has convinced me that it's fine. I am happy with our Percy Jackson fic though, just need to continue it. I haven't worked on the Harry/Luvia in a while, but I finished 2 chapters of it, just never posted them. The new RWBY idea I had has chapter 1 done, and half of chapter 2 done but I haven't had time to work on it in over a week.

****** The only jarring thing I can remember is Akeno immediately killing Harry but the rest was fine. I am not really a fan of rewrites to be honest, I find it better to use the motivation to work in something new but I am not THE author.

******* Yeah, that is one of the things I definitely don't like. Honestly, I don't even know why I decided to do that. I had the idea earlier but the way I wrote it, the closer I got I realized it didn't fit but stubbornly refused to change my originally idea. I'm not going to rewrite it, but I may try a new DxD story one day.

**** " This was totally the best day of Harry's life. Might be the /last/, too, considering how bullshit the Holy Grail War was, but that did not even make it wobble in its position.

There was /no/ other day he'd see people trying to murder each other over who got to murder him while in the ruins of the place he'd lived for the worst days (and majority) of his life.

If nothing else, Number 4 Privet Drive couldn't be burned down /again/. A building by that name could, but it wouldn't be the one he had hated so much.

He could even enjoy the sight of Privet Drive burning to the bedrock - oh how sweet this was, if only he had a camera on hand like the Creeveys - without a single twinge of his conscience, because one or the other of the people who'd come after him had been nice enough to evacuate anyone that might get hurt first.

There was a bit of bad news - one of the Masters looked to be associated with Voldemort, going by the half-dozen Death Eaters that had promptly looked at each other and apparated far, far away the moment Harry and Berserker had stepped out of the cordon without either of the Servants keeping them tied up - but Harry had a lot of giddiness to offset it.

Really, if Voldemort burned down Privet Drive without injuring innocent bystanders while trying to murder Harry, Harry could get behind that. "

Yeah, it was the shit.

  It all went wrong. Harry is locked away in Azkaban for decades as Voldemort destroys and conquers the magical world and beyond unchallenged. However, Voldemort's greatest strength will be used against him, and Harry is sent back in time with one mission: to kill the Dark Lord before he rises again.

  After the defeat of Voldemort, life for Harry Potter hadn't gone as expected. The Auror life wasn't for him, and his relationship with Ginny had failed. Now, as an unofficial Curse-Breaker, a more skilled Harry has found himself on Remnant saving the life of a certain Atlas Specialist. With magic returning to the land, will Harry succeed where others have failed in combating Salem?

  Once, Thor was James Potter, New Mexico being a refinement of Odin's technique (being murdered didn't do Thor's sanity any favours). After a decade, a mostly reformed Loki restores his memories, introducing Thor's son, Harry, to new family and friends. But soon, ancient secrets emerge along with enemies both old and new as darkness rises. Harry is left with a choice: Fight or Die.
