Fics where the review of teaching practices in the Fifth Book is taken as being a positive thing, resulting in positive change, regardless of who's actually doing the review.

Umbridge was designed to be a maximally hateful character, and honestly it would be kind of interesting to see a fic where she was tweaked to be less unpleasant or otherwise better at her job. I think I vaguely remember a story where she became the teacher for History of Magic rather than defense, and while she was pretty obviously biased she was actually very knowledgeable and decent at lecturing. EDDIT: The Fic in question is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8914586/1/Harry-Potter-Junior-Inquisitor][Harry Potter: Junior Inquisitor]], sadly dead but still worth a read.

However, completely secondary to her, it really does seem like the standards at Hogwarts have fallen over the years and several aspects of the children's education is coming out subpar. It would be cool to see a more canny Fudge appoint someone neutral and objective to the post of High Inquisitor who was ready to take the administration to task.

Hagrid might be a nice guy, but he is also /definitely/ not qualified to teach such a dangerous subject as Care of Magical creatures. Malfoy was a twit, sure, but a competent teacher is going to prepare beforehand for children not following instructions or not paying attention to instructions. If Hagrid wanted to make an object lesson on how important it was to pay close attention to his lectures he should have started out with a creature that was more disgusting than dangerous, like a magical skunk or something, so that any students who weren't paying attention would be embarrassed, but not physically hurt. As is so often pointed out, he is personally more resistant to harm, which skews his perception of what is and isn't appropriate. This is simply not okay when you have someone teaching a dangerous subject, and the whole fiasco with the Blast Ended Skrewts shows that he didn't learn a damn thing from his first year of teaching.

Divination is a bit harder to judge, but it does seem like Trewlaney is probably not a very good teacher, and that her curriculum probably needs some level of modification. Whether this is because only people with The Sight can even benefit from the class at all or because she teaches prognostication rather than scrying and such is up in the air, but something really should be done to fix the class. Yes, she has at least a minor talent for prophecy (very minor) but that doesn't really mean she's qualified to teach.

Potions probably needs at least some level of overhaul. The number of accidents clearly demonstrates that, /at a minimum/, Snape is unable to adequately supervise his charges, and the number of complaints from students would also seem to cast doubt on his curriculum design and lecture habits. In keeping with the trend formed by Hagrid and Trewlaney, it appears more that he was hired because he had a level of personal talent in the field, which is certainly something we look for in a teacher, but is *not*, it should be noted, the same thing /at all/ as teaching skill.

History of Magic is a joke. Yes it can be a bit dry memorizing facts and figures but a good teacher can make history come alive! That Binns remains on staff seems so ludicrous that one starts contemplating rather extreme possibilities such as Hogwarts being in some kind of dire financial straights that require he retain his position simply because he isn't paid.

And then Defense. Oh Defense. It is, apparently, common knowledge that the position is cursed. And yet. The Hogwarts faculty has done nothing about this. Has let the situation fester for nearly 50 years, in fact! Stability and consistency of curriculum is essential for any class, but it appears to be entirely hit and miss if the students will learn anything at all, and the various individuals hired on for the position have swung wildly back and forth in terms of both reliability and teaching ability, which doesn't even mention how the subject matter appears to have been pulled out of a hat each year.

It should also be noted that Astronomy appears to be given far more attention than it probably should receive, but that is somewhat of a subjective question as there are magics that refer to or rely on the position and disposition of the various celestial spheres.

​

Anyone know any fics that actually address this where characters push for a review of Hogwarts teaching standards or where Umbridge is cast in a more neutral light? EDIT: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWw45Ro8Rr0][Harry Potter and the Sacred Text]] has an interesting take on Umbridge.

**** The practical part of Harry's Divination OWL was crystal ball reading, tea-leaf reading, and palm-reading. Since the OWL would have been put together by the ministry and not Trelawney, we can assume that there was some competence involved, and that it's a good indication of what students should be able to do. I think this is a strong point in favor of Divination being as you describe it.

Divination being useless unless you're a seer is like saying that Transfiguration is useless unless you're a metamorphmagus.

*** That's kind of what I was imagining. Like, imagine this. They give Harry veritaseruem at the trial and it comes out that yes, he really was attacked by Dementors. Suddenly a huge block of the wizengamot is giving Fudge the side eye. They don't necessarily buy all the Voldemort stuff that Dumbles is laying down, but this is a separate thing. Can Fudge be trusted to administrate if he can't even keep track of Dementors? So now, Fudge isn't quite in the spot where he can swing putting a patsy in place to slam Dumbles, but the idea of an Inquisitor is still floated. There's been some 'concerns' raised over Dumbledore's management of Hogwarts, not just recently but over the past few years (cough troll cough basilisk cough werewolf professor almost ate some students cough). The Ministry is going to send someone in to find out what's what. But this time, it's going to be someone basically neutral. Maybe someone like Madame Marchbanks, older than dirt and not going to take any bs from Dumbles /or/ Fudge. So she's the one going through the school with a fine toothed comb, not to try and oust Dumble's favorites, but to critically examine teaching standards from an objective perspective. And she finds Hogwarts wanting in several regards.

***** I don't like Dumbledore bashing either, but I think it's the same general problem reiterated. Snape is good at potions so he should also be good at teaching about potions right? Dumbledore was a good teacher so he should be good at administrating a school, right? If we're being real, I think Dumbles big problem is that he's way overworked, and often seems to trust that people will be better than they actually are without actually trusting other people to do important things.

My big overhaul for the administration would be: Make Dumbledore step down as Headmaster. Make McGonagal Headmistress. Put someone else as Head of Gryffindor, maybe Dumbledore can do it in the interim. Sprout as Deputy Head. Keep Dumbledore on, and let him teach Transfiguration again, at least until they can hire someone new, then maybe let him do just NEWT level classes or start teaching an Alchemy course.

And, on a personal note, he should get someone to replace him as Chief Warlock. Now he still has a toe in with Hogwarts and on the international scene but his duties at Hogwarts are greatly reduced and geared towards something he might be a bit better at.

Dumbledore isn't a bad guy, but you don't have to be a bad guy to make bad choices, and it feels like he tried to do everything at once and couldn't quite hack it. He needs to take a step back and refocus his efforts, trust his subordinates to handle stuff, and not treat Hogwarts like its his to staff with the people he likes rather than the people who would be best for the job. Like I've actually heard a theory that he hired Lockhart specifically to try and prove he was a fraud. That's not an okay reason to hire someone to teach a class at your school.

** I have some notes (but a backlog of actual writing to do) about a slice-of-life fic where Snape has a sub for a week and the students start to realize that Snape running a tight ship actually results in /fewer/ accidents, and he enlists Flitwick to help with protection charms that make most of the accidents melt cauldrons instead of blow them up. The rough outline for this fic includes something like when the current students find out Dumbledore was considering scrapping Potions as a class entirely because Slughorn let too much slide and did stuff like leaving out open cauldrons of Amortentia and sent so many students to the infirmary that it used to be located in the dungeons... but then he hired Snape for the job because /reasons/, and Dumbledore's inclined to give Snape some slack for being such a sour git because no one is literally /dying/ in potions accidents anymore.

I once had a chemistry teacher that told us if the only thing we actually remember from his class was the lab safety procedures, then we will have gotten something very valuable. That's where I'm coming from with this concept.

But yeah, some /actual/ educational reforms sounds like a good idea ;)

*** I think its unfair to call Trewlaney a fraud. She can make prophecies... or at least two, over a 14 year period anyway, but it really seems like she's getting lost in the sauce and her classes suffer for it. Being good at making prophecies doesn't necessarily make you good at teaching. The problem is just how vague Divination is. I'm reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10629488/1/Blood-Crest][Blood Crest]] and I actually really like their approach to the subject which I feel is tastefully nuanced while still being mostly canon compatible. Mostly, Trewlaney needs to get over herself, grow some self confidence, and structure her curriculum better to provide for the students. As it stands she is a poor teacher, though depending on how the subject really works not a terrible one. Bashing is lame, but criticism isn't bashing in and of itself.

** Hi - I don't think I've ever seen mention of Umbridge perhaps not being the worst person ever, so in lieu of me actually sharing a fic with you, here is a drabble I quickly scribbled (and did not proofread).

​

Dolores Umbridge had no exactly no desire to teach at Hogwarts. She was perfectly content to continue her work at the Ministry of Magic; work she knew she was quite good at. There was a settled rhythm to her days - rise at 5:00, brew a strong cup of coffee (5 sugars), set off to work to get there a solid half hour before anyone else in the office, and get started on paperwork immediately. It was a comfort, this sort of work. Dealing with children and doubtlessly incompetent professors did not sound like a comfort. However, one did not turn down the Minister of Magic. Minister Fudge said she was the right pick for the job and while she did agree, it was with a heavy heart that she packed up her belongings from the Ministry.

From what she had been briefed on about the past few decades of Defense Against the Dark Arts teachers, there was a shocking lack of oversight in regards to the curriculum. Those poor children had been taught by vagabonds and riff raff and disgraced members of society. It seemed as though most viewed defense literature as unnecessary, and the ones who did treated it as a loose guideline to teach inappropriate magics that were well beyond the student's years!

No, no, that wouldn't do at all. Completely inappropriate and unheard of, how those young children were treated. It seemed to Dolores that the only way to go about this gross oversight would to start from the very basics. In fact, she had had an old school friend who had gone on to write a Defense textbook, if she recalled correctly... Slinkhard, perhaps, Will Slinkhard. She would send him an owl right away and get his viewpoint on how to go about helping these students. They would start on a basic curriculum until it was clear that everyone understood the foundation of defensive magic. She smiled to herself, pleased that she had come up with the obvious solution so simply. Her pace quickened, as she hurried off to pen a letter to Slinkhard. Perhaps she shouldn't be so worried about this new direction her life was taking - it was quickly seeming like this would be a wonderful year for herself and for Hogwarts.

*** Your example is hilarious because yes, kids are morons, though doubting your teacher when he says "fire is hot" seems like a bit much even then. But Hagrid didn't even really do that. His warning was basically "hippogriffs are proud and might get grumpy if you're disrespectful". Like, ok, so, what does that even mean? Will they attack me? Will they turn away in a huff? Will they use an omnidirectional acid spray? What even constitutes being disrespectful? We have to bow, okay, cool, how low? How close do we have to be? Just a few words in the vein of "this is a large and potentially dangerous creature that can and will injure you if you don't follow my instructions" would have gone a long way to alleviating my concerns. In the movie they only had the one hippogriff, but iirc in the book it was like the entire herd. In the movie case, Hagrid should have been monitoring the kids interacting with the single specimen very closely and carefully, from close enough that he could immediately pull them out of danger if needed. This is a big dangerous creature. Don't just wave at the students like "have fun". Professor McGonagal started off her very first lecture with "Transfiguration is dangerous and messing about will not be tolerated". If a student ignores her instructions then that's on them, but teachers can design curriculum dealing with dangerous topics in ways to minimize the danger, or in ways to make sure students heed the warnings before they get hurt. Like chemistry teachers requiring you to wear labcoats, goggles, and close toed shoes. You can't stop someone sticking their hand in a flame, but you can make it harder for them to dump sulfuric acid in their eyes.

Only Malfoy intentionally disobeying the rules got injured and even then only lightly. I think Hagrid did pretty well.
