** I had a prompt for that that I never started: Harry finds himself inside his father's body during the courtship of lily. To protect his own existence he must seduce his own mother. I imagined it as a crackfic.

I've only ever read one where Harry goes back to the Marauder's time bodily.

  Post-DH, Pre-Epilogue. The Wizarding world is slowly recovering, and Hogwarts is re-opened. Harry Potter struggles to become a good DADA teacher, but it's hard when a large portion of his mind is commandeered by four familiar Marauders. Slash and het.
