No super edgy little shit and no unnecessary bashing, I'm not looking for that weird over the top stuff.

Buuut... his family is horrible, everyone in the town he grew up is horrible, he almost gets killed multiple times a year from the age of eleven because Dumbledore is horrible.

You'd think that justifies some darker traits like a dim view of humanity, an interest in learning how to blast his way out of trouble, and a need to regularly release his frustration in a violent manner (a punching bag or stuff he can break and magically repair)

You know like a normal teenager?


** Honestly why do fanfiction writers have to add weird conspiracies and bashing?

If I'd found out that the teacher who'd been bullying me for years and sabotaging one of the core classes that I need was actually once a terrorist belonging to the group that killed my family I'd be pretty mad.

Actually if someone did that even without being a wizard Nazi death squad member I'd also be mad.

Or if I found out my babysitter knew about magic all along and had been reporting to Dumbledore.

Or if I found out I'd just been exposed to three murder attempts in my first year of school because my headmaster wanted to lure the dark lord into a school full of children.

Or if my entire school treated me like a wannabe wizard Nazi serial killer because of a talent I didn't know about.

Or if my friend got arrested and send to Azkaban without a trial by the minister of magic.

Or of I found out that my godfather had been convicted to a life sentence without a trial .

*** Alright, but if all that's happening then we have to admit that hes /not/ a normal teenager. Any one of those things would seriously fuck up the emotional development of a child, far beyond the temper tantrum he throws in Dumbledore's office in fifth year.

**** That's what I mean, I guess I understand where the mentally cracked dark Harry fics come from, but I'd like to read a story with a reasonable of anger and rebellious behaviour.

It could be an open letter to the prophet in his second year, boycotting potions class, publicly calling out people or just learning destructive spells and making the room of requirement provide an unlimited supply of pottery.

Also every time he does get mad or gloomy everyone treats him like he's being unreasonable (I guess more in fanfiction than canon, but still)

Anger would be healthier than the bottling up he seems to do

***** I think that Harry (fanon or canon) doesn't have near enough anxiety for someone who has gone through everything that he has. He has basically no stability in his life at all, and as a kid that oughta really mess with him. Honestly he ought to really vibe with Mad Eye's paranoia.

***** When it comes to PTSD, fight-flight-freeze is fairly adaptive in his situation; he seems alright because his behaviour fits with what's going on. My personal theory is that he struggles immensely during peacetime when he's finally got the brain space to to process what's happened. I think Cursed Child indicates this, albeit to a lesser degree.

Not all abused children show the signs you would expect, some children never show a flag at all. I would argue that Harry shows plenty, it's just that it fits with the context of the story.

Incidentally, the adults in his life almost certainly have no training to deal with situations like his and his friends don't have an adult understanding. So they treat him as though he is unreasonable and thus he is less likely to confide and so on. It's easier for people to ignore problems they can't solve.

It's very common that the first person a child tells will dismiss them which is why children are advised to keep trying until someone helps.

That said, I do enjoy a reasonably angry Harry Potter story, but it's hard to find one that sticks to canon level of abuse as his life doesn't need any embellishments to send him over the edge.

But that's not the point, the point is I'm looking for fanfiction stories where Harry is angrier than in canon, but not a massive psycho like in most dark Harry fanfiction stories.

***** I disagree with your interpretation of canon character traits, but that's not the discussion.

I honestly don't know of a story that has subtler bashing of characters that's not really considered bashing. It's hard to determine because many authors put bashing but it's not always the same, what's bashing in your opinion?

****** Over the top stuff like making the Weasleys and Dumbledore love potion using bloodline thieves..

I don't mind pointing out issues, slightly exaggerating character traits or even coming up with clever conspiracies/ explanations, but I don't want half the characters to become two dimensional cartoon villains.

But I mainly meant that I think Harry has enough reason to have a darker disposition/ temper without adding stuff like over the top child abuse and manipulation into the mix.

He continued the series somewhat in *Love Thy Self* but I don't know if you will like it. I preferred the first two parts myself. However at the end of fourth part there was a really strong moment that took place. You might like it.

**** I'm pretty sure he's not forgotten, but because of the circumstances they just can't find him. Just know that it's pretty dark. Harry's really emotionally screwed up, but it's not done in an overly cringy way like other wbwl fics. Reading up to chapter 11 gives you a pretty good idea of whether or not you'll like it. For most of the second half, I was bawling my eyes out. This fic legit had me depressed for the next couple days, but it's so worth it.
