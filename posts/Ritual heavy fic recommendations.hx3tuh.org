Hey folks

I'm looking for fics that are heavy on the use of rituals, doesn't have to be everyone using them, but definitely the protagonist- Harry/Hermione/whatev.

Something like the tattoo ritual in strength of steel wings, or the ones Hermione does in the arithmancer.

Reading new blood currently and definitely like how it is going, but want more.


** linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom) has a lot of pagan-style rituals performed by Harry. It hasn't been updated in a while but would still recommend reading

***** There's very little to do with almost all of the cast. In this story, Harry recognizes he needs training and tracks down a super exclusive school that will train him in different magics, rituals and blood magic, amongst others. It has a major diversion from canon but the world building the author does is amazing. Harry finds himself embroiled in a much bigger plot than just Voldemort.

** Linkao3(Flutter by bking4) has a big focus on rituals, especially on how ritual magic involves the magic of the world or some type of sentience outside that of the caster.

It's also one of the few fics I've come across that is primarily female-focused without bashing or villainizing the male characters - they're still around and doing their thing, they just aren't the focus of the story. It was quite refreshing to read.

  The traces of Dark magic aren't swept away with a summer and a trip abroad. It leaves marks on its victims, deep gouges in their soul, and just being in its presence can irrevocably change a person. You can never really overcome Dark magic, only survive it and hope for the best. This is Ginny Weasley, doing her best.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous Boy-Who-Lived, seemed a good idea.
