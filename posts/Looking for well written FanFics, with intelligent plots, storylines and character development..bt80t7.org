:END:
Hi fellow HP FanFiction readers,

I'm looking for FanFiction recommendations that are well written (with no or minimal grammatical mistakes) and include intelligent plots and storylines and have well thought out character development.

I know it's a big ask to have all of these aspects in a single story, but unfortunately I'm a picky dude. I often start reading a fic and get a few chapters in and become put off by poor writing.

I have read a few phenomenal fics such as:

Family Bonds - linkffn(7724057)

Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux - linkffn(11762850)

Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin - linkffn(11191235)

Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality - linkffn(5782108)

And am looking for help in finding new fics to read, as I seem to struggle finding more myself.

NO slash Any pairings

I'm also an avid reader of time travel fics so if you have any recommendations please pass them on.

Yes I am already aware of the FanFiction recommendation system previously posted here ([[https://ficrecs.elusiveguy.com/][this site for the unaware]]) - however it doesn't take other factors such as poor writing into consideration and I feel that the sheeple with poor reading skills and tastes far out way true representation of some fanfics worth.

Edit: Forgot to add I'm looking for fics over 100K words the more words the better. I ideally look for 200-400k words and have read as much as 700k words

You linked a Wrong BWL. Most of the time, the traits you are looking for can't be found in such a fic. Is it ( /Family Bonds/ ) actually that good?

Tales From Durmstrang: Poisoned Bloodlines

”In the modern-day wizarding world, two half-blood wizards attended Durmstrang with hopes of bringing change and justice to all students regardless of blood status. They seemed inseparable until tragedy struck, leading to them departing ways. While one withdrew to the shadows, the other boy continued the rebellion against the pure-blood hierarchy with hopes of killing it once and for all."

**** In that case, here's my fic: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18697885/chapters/44344702]]

It's also on FFN under the same username if you prefer that platform.

I have to admit that when I started writing it, I didn't think it would turn out as large as it did and therefore the first 10 chapters or so are a bit different compared to the rest of the story. It's 455k in and I'm still updating it on a near daily basis.

The one thing I pride myself on is the fact that the main story line is consistent throughout the entire fic, and all of the smaller plots are there to support it. I hope you dig it +and it's also perfectly okay if you don't.+

** If you like action rich, here's a few of my favorites:

Linkffn(The Many Deaths of Harry Potter)

Very scary Voldemort, immortal but not invincible Harry.

Linkffn(Divided and Entwined)

Very racist ministry prefers appeasement, Hermione is a fugitive and decides that if the ministry doesn't fight the Death Eaters, she'll do it herself.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief)

Harry and Hermione play auror and thief. Epic heist action.

Linkffn(Patron)

This one has very good worldbuilding and a rather unique Harry/Hermione relationship.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea.

** - Intelligent plot and character developtment

- HPMOR

One of these things is not like the others...

Nah, salt aside, my go to suggestion is the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11591125/1/The-Definition-of-Normal][Perfectly Normal]] series, by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/6872861/BrilliantLady][BrilliantLady]]. It's quite possibly the /single/ best written Harry Potter fic on the net. It's a /masterfully/ written piece of worldbuilding, exploring the ideas and elements of canon- without ever leaving out a /single/ unsavory or unfortunate detail- in a realistic way, that explores the concept that the Wizarding World is literally an entire alien civilization, hidden from view. It explores the idea of their religious beliefs, their political allegiances, and their seeming independence from British government, but it also explores ideas like /why/ Muggleborns are discriminated against, or /why/ Voldemort led a rebellion in the first place, and why it was so successful. On that note, it also has /fantastic/ characterization- Voldemort is transformed from an evil, incompetent, caricature to a realistic, believable human being with reasonable goals, driven mad by his abuse of dark magic and his continued failure to accomplish those goals.

** If you loved Harry Potter and the method of rationnality then I will advise you to read my favorite fanfic of all time, inspired by The Methods.

Great modifications of the book's plot, funny as hell, very long and with the best OC main character I've ever seen :

​

I present you Harry Potter and the Natural 20. Crossover with D&D (very mostly one Wizard character from D&D in Harry Potter world). Even if you don't know anything about D&D, please try it anyway. I had onyl very limited knowledge and just went with the story and it went very well !

** Big fan of A Marauder's Plan by CatsAreCool. Beautifully long fic, logical conclusions, excellently written.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1085412]]

​

Also love Loten's Harry Potter fics (be warned-- HG/SS pairing)-- they're long and really wonderfully written.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again.
