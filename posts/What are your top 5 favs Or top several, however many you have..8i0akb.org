Could be crossovers, could be OCs, could be romance, could be adventure, could be anything. I'll go first.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11115934/1/][The Shadow of Angmar:]] Harry gets summoned to Middle Earth (after he dies to Voldemort in the Forbidden Forest) by Angmar.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12713828/1/][Victoria Potter:]] Harry is a girl, and not named Harry.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6254783/1/Rise-of-the-Wizards][Rise of the Wizards:]] Just a curb stomp. Good for lazy weekend afternoons.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11132113/1/The-Difference-One-Man-Can-Make][The Difference One Man Can Make:]] Set in Game of Thrones. It's better than any other ASOIAF crossover I've seen.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4684861/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Lands-Below][Alexandra Quick and the Lands Below:]] Magic in America with all OCs. Pretty good.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5353809/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Boy-Who-Lived][Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived:]] Favorite of all time. There are 10 more chapters on the DLP forums.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12740667/1/The-Mind-Arts][The Mind Arts:]] A newer one. Pretty good.

I'm a sucker for Harry/Daph, I think I've read about 98% of all Daph/Harry fics that are on ffnet.

*** I too enjoy Harry/Daphne. As strange as Prince is, it features them together. Have you read linkffn(Ice Princess by Luan Mao)? It's a different take on Harry/Daphne making fun of the tropeyness of the pairing but still enjoyable as a guilty pleasure.

**** Yes, I really enjoyed that one, I'm always up for a different Daph. This was actually the first one shot I've read (chap 2 is a parody that isn't even funny imo)

Have you read that one where she's isolated because she's extremely tall and is bullied as if she was half-giantess? Really sweet too. I'll check if I remember or find the name of that. "To touch the Stars"

EDIT: But I think the most impressive and different Daph has to be from "The Lies that Bind". Boy was that a twist that I did not see it coming.

***** I agree with you on Chapter 2 of that one. As to your second, I have not thank you for the rec :)

Have you read /To Be Queen/ by sapphyreangel? That's a weird fic that is from Daphne's POV that I don't think I've ever seen recced.

Hmm. I enjoyed that one, but my favorite Daphne has to be from /Death Before Dishonour/ by SuperNova26.

I'd rec you Duality but I'm sure you've already read it, although I believe its one of the better ones. Cage and Key is also abandoned and solid.

Very solid to find another person who enjoys this pairing as much as I do :)

****** Yes, but idk, I got bored halfway through it. I'm not that huge of a fan of Harems, unless extremely well-done. I did think the setting was interesting, and I particularly liked Tonks on this fic, but that's all I remember from it.

Really liked Duality, she's way ruthless than usual in that one. Cage and Key was the second Daph Fic i've read, right after that garbage (which was my first HP fic overall) Angry Harry and the Seven.

Never seen this "Death Before Dishonour" and by the summary it does seem interesting.

I'm sure you've read, but there a couple new ones that showed up, "Good Days and Bad Days" - which is about an average Daph with really serious issues, but really sweet. The other is "Better With You" just a fluffy post-war allaround. Have you read "Black coffee, with sugar?" Its another really sweet post-war but with a twist.

** Most of yours are abandoned (1,2,4,5,6). My sympathies, it never gets any easier.

In no particular order (all complete) and likely will change as time goes by, but for now they are:

linkffn(4180686) is incredible for how short it is. It shows the hardships of Harry's life but still brings hope.

linkffn(6892925) is very common around here, but the emotions it brings are unparalleled while remaining very much in character.

linkffn(11574569) What can I say I'm a sucker for tropes done well.

linkffn(12267737) A Venetian AU that somehow manages to be Harry Potter. Very unique and well written.

linkffn(8629685) Overly Dark? Perhaps. The Firebird Trilogy remains the most unique and creative AU I've came across and still managed to do something truly original even if it has its flaws.

  Most of yours are abandoned (1,2,4,5,6). My sympathies, it never gets any easier.
#+end_quote

1. Shadow of Angmar /literally/ just updated *34 DAYS AGO*. Slow updates =/= Abandoned.

2. Taure has not abandoned Victoria Potter. He is just focusing on his new headcanon document at the moment. He has /publicly/ on the sub and /privately/ in a message to me stated that work on Victoria Potter will resume once the updated headcanon document is completed.

I'll give it to you that the other stories you listed in what I quoted above may be abandoned. Though it has been only just over a year since The Difference One Man Can Make updated (01-Feb-2017), so it might be hasty to consider it fully abandoned.

EDIT: Correction, in the sub post he only stated that the headcanon document is the reason he hasn't posted updates on Victoria Potter recently. This implies that the story will update once document is complete.

I wasn't a huge fan of the Firebird Trilogy, but I can't disagree that its certainly creative. The matriarchal society was pretty well done, but the third book was a bit much. Creating the "new ministry" from prophecies? That was a bit over the top.

** Ryuugi‘ linkffn(The Master of Death by rgm0005) is great.

Shadow of Angmar was mentioned as was The Santi's work.

The best non crossover in my opinion is linkffn(a cadmean victory). I think it improves on cannon in a number of ways, particular in terms of Voldemort's and Harry's relationship.

Though I'd pick the firebird's son trilogy as a close second. This is the only decent harem work, in my opinion. (This might change as linkffn(I'm Still here) and linkffn(What's a little death between friends) continues.) The sexualization of magic is intense.

*** I'm glad someone other than myself enjoyed The Firebird Trilogy. It suffers from the usual things a Darth Marrs fic has (over the top drama, faux darkness, too many strange powers), but it truly is creative. I want to see more AU's that attempt things beyond just changing a minor element, and actually creating a believable world. Most AU's fall flat in that regard, and tend to try and put themselves back on the rails of canon when in my opinion the opposite should happen. That point of divergence should lead the story away from canon into uncharted territory, where the writer begins to take over and make it their own.

  Harriet Potter is back for a fourth year of quietly masquerading as her pureblooded cousin in order to pursue her dream. There are those in the Wizarding World who refuse to see her fade into the background, however, and when the forces she's been ignoring conspire to bring her to the fore, it will take everything she has to see her artifice through. Alanna the Lioness take on HP4.

** linkffn(A Long Journey Home) is probably my all time favorite. It bridges several very strong stories together with the common red thread of Jasmine.

linkffn(Embers by Vathara) isn't Harry Potter, but it is my number two. It's a massive AU take on the A:TLA world with a bunch of awesome characters and an expansive history explaining the current state of affairs.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time) is an epic tale that sweeps me off my feet. It is action-packed, it's wildy creative and it's simply awesome.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived by The Santi) is one of the best fics that manages to make a school setting intrigueing. It's got good characters and good conflict.

linkffn(I See The Moon) is a dreamy, up in the clouds, Avengers crossover that never fails to put a smile on my face.

linkffn(A Hero by Celebony) is a oneshot that "redeems" Dudley and does so in a believable way. As a sucker for Dudley redemption, this fic has the best Dudley redemption in progress I've read.

linkffn(All The Dementors of Azkaban) is my favorite piece of crack. It's just plain funny.

  AU PoA: When Luna Lovegood is condemned to Azkaban prison for her part in opening the Chamber of Secrets, Harry Potter is the first to protest. Minister Fudge is reluctant to comply, but then again he never really had a choice in the first place. Oneshot.

** linkffn(10751741) A happy, different post OOTP summer with a believable teenage relationship. The semi-sequel is great as well.

linkffn(10798339) The best depiction of emotions I have read so far. Not the best technical writing or the most thrilling plot, but the author surely has her unique way with words.

linkffn(11938904) Quality comedy one-shot.

linkffn(12188150) Tonks travels ten months back through time, the eventual sequel is supposed to turn Tonks/Harry into Tonks/Harry/Hermione.

linkffn(12101842) Looks like it will turn into the first solid harem fic, despite being Harry/Tonks/Bellatrix/Lily. Obviously time travel but so far really high writing quality.

linkffn(5445767) Harry/Romilda with a genuinely likeable McLaggen as wingman.

linkffn(3752722) comedy gold

  A found phone number, the decision to tale a risk. What does a different summer of 96 hold for Harry? A tale of light romance. No secret training no major angst. For once Harry meets someone normal. Now completed. A tale of one summer.
