What if Dumbledore is incompetent because after the whole thing with Arianna Aberforth made him swear an Unbreakable Oath to make him not seek power, and the wording made Dumbledore a terrible war-leader, and he found loopholes that allowed him to hold the government positions he does, and that's why Aberforth never forgave him?

Unbreakable Oaths require three people to be put in place. You cannot swear an arbitrary Oath to yourself as far as we know.

#+begin_quote
  wording made Dumbledore a terrible war-leader
#+end_quote

Really? How do you know he was a terrible war leader? As far as we saw, Voldemort was more worried about the order than Aurors. Voldemort even went as far as saying that he couldn't win the war unless Dumbledore was assasinated, he practically admitted that he couldn't win a duel with Dumbledore in order to kill him.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

He doesn't really hold much power in the government, seeing as how his position can be easily swayed by the Ministry's liberal oligarchy quite easily.

#+begin_quote
  and that's why Aberforth never forgave him
#+end_quote

I honestly don't understand the train of thought, what does one have to do with the other? Abeforth didn't forgive Albus because Albus never admitted fault for Arianna's death, he was too proud and he always circumvented the fact that he had gotten her killed. Sure, he shows remorse, but does he ever really take the blame? Does he ever allow himself to let go of the mask and be honest? No, he hides behind it, even on the Platform with Harry. Canon Dumbledore irks me. He's a man that is haunted by demons from hundreds of years ago, and the demons seem to only touch him when he needs them the least.

I don't think he regretted her murder enough. Remember HP series is third person limited with HP PoV. Whatever we read was how HP saw or understood stuff which might be true, false or deception.

He left HP at mercy of abusive relatives, prepared HP for sacrifice, and left Sirirus to rot in prison, and many other things.

Isn't it funny that creatures that were considered dark such as Lupin, Fleur etc were shunned in magical Britain that was shaped by Dumbledore and his tea party despite them trying to come off as liberals.

It's not his fault thoguh. HP was written for children and children do love Hero Vs Villain stuff where villains are so stupid that they go by names such as Dark Lord and Death Eaters.

I mean, you're entitled to your extreme opinion of Dumbledore, but let me try and clear a few things up - /physical/ abuse from the Dursleys is only ever /implied/ in the books, with the infamous "frying pan swipe" that people love shoving everywhere, and Vernon threatening to knock the stuffing out of Harry should he forget to keep up his cover story for Aunt Marge being the furthest extreme, barring Dudley's idiocy. Otherwise it's just a particular case of neglect, poor care and - from what it seems from Harry's perspective - limited emotional/psychological abuse.

The issue with the Dursleys is that it's never shown how /necessary/ it was for Harry to stay with them, and thus leaves it free for people to say it was all some evil scheme/incompetence. I like to think that the blood protection from Petunia actually /did something/, because otherwise you'd be completely right and Dumbledore would've had no real reason to leave Harry with obviously unfit carers.

On the dark creature front, though, Lupin and the other Werewolves /are absolutely/ dark creatures, and are just as oppressed everywhere in the wizarding world, by the sound of it at least. When members of their community /routinely/ attack innocent people, either killing them or turning them into Werewolves too - not to mention the fact that many seem to support Greyback and therefore Voldemort, according to Lupin - the prejudice is much easier to justify. And I don't know where you heard that Veela were treated as dark creatures in Britain, because I'm pretty sure that's not mentioned in the books.

The issue is that you seem to think that Dumbledore was in charge of the whole country for the years between Voldemort's first death and the events of the first book, but it's clearly stated that Dumbledore has no real influence in politics out of choice - he offers advice freely to people like Fudge, but doesn't /control/ the Ministry. As for his other positions, there's no actual canon description of their duties and the freedoms they entail, so saying that because he was Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot or the Supreme Mugwump of the ICW literally means /nothing/ in terms of his ability to, say, get an outwardly-guilty criminal like Sirius Black out of prison. You talk about Dumbledore's 'party' but we don't actually ever know how Magical Britain /works/, how it's /governed/, so really I don't think you can sit there and say he had a posse of supporters which he could've used to run the country.

All that said, I agree that the way HP is written doesn't lend itself easily to explaining Dumbledore's actions, and the difficulty in approaching his position is only made worse by the fact the first few books are clearly intended for children, and he avoids explaining important shit like the need for blood protection behind bland platitudes of "you'll know when you're older".

Otherwise, OP, I think it'd be pretty cool to see an Albus that either voluntarily performed or was coerced into an Unbreakable Vow to stay away from power. It would be interesting to see how he'd get around such a vow (depending on its wording of course) and try and save the world.

**** Dumbledore had plenty political power. He was The Headmaster of Hogwarts Grand Sorcerer Supreme Mugwump Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot

Plenty of titles that supposedly carry great deal of respect, and assumably political power.

Let's say I'm wrong, and most of those titles mean nothing. He was still Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot. That sounds like a very high up position. He could have at least used that position to give Sirius a trial(which Sirius never got).

Let's go to the abuse bit. The famous frying pan:

#+begin_quote
  Aunt Petunia knew he hadn't really done magic, but he still had to duck as she aimed a heavy blow at his head with the soapy frying pan
#+end_quote

Its mentioned way to casually for it not to be a regular occurrence.

Another part from the books.

#+begin_quote
  Well, I've got news for you, boy. . . . I'm locking you up. . . . You're never going back to that school . . . never . . . and if you try and magic yourself out --- they'll expel you!” And laughing like a maniac, he dragged Harry back upstairs. Uncle Vernon was as bad as his word. The following morning, he paid a man to fit bars on Harry's window. He himself fitted a cat-flap in the bedroom door, so that small amounts of food could be pushed inside three times a day. They let Harry out to use the bathroom morning and evening. Otherwise, he was locked in his room around the clock.
#+end_quote

this implies that the only reason they didnt lock him up all the time was because they thought he would use magic to free himself.He's certainly starving at that point. His hunger is extreme enough for it to be painful:

#+begin_quote
  "Harry, whose insides were aching with hunger, [...]"
#+end_quote

Also Harry was regularly beaten by Dudley and his Gang. They Called it "Harry Hunting"

Several Quotes from the Book:

#+begin_quote
  The escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor earned Harry his longest-ever punishment. By the time he was allowed out of his cupboard again, the summer holidays had started and Dudley had already broken his new video camera, crashed his remote control airplane, and, first time out on his racing bike, knocked down old Mrs. Figg as she crossed Privet Drive on her crutches.
#+end_quote

Dudley's Violence bit. One of many more to be found.

#+begin_quote
  unless of course it involved punching somebody. Dudley's favorite punching bag was Harry
#+end_quote

His parents are ok with Dudley beating Harry.

#+begin_quote
  “They stuff people's heads down the toilet the first day at Stonewall,” he told Harry. “Want to come upstairs and practice?”
#+end_quote

That is probably close to waterboarding.

#+begin_quote
  After a minute of confused fighting, in which everyone got hit a lot by the Smelting stick,
#+end_quote

That probably hurt a lot. I went through the first two chapters involving Harry and that was probably not all there is to be found.

#+end_quote

/All/ of that is assumption and conjecture. There isn't a single piece of evidence to suggest that that position would give Dumbledore the power to give Sirius a trial, even assuming he wanted to - because I'm fairly sure he assumed Sirius' guilt like everyone else. You're just assuming that those positions gave him political power, which I've said before are never gotten into in to canon and therefore /can't/ be used as actual evidence. You're welcome to assume but because none of it is ever confirmed it's inadmissible as evidence of Dumbledore's political power.

As for the Dursleys, I can't defend their behaviour or really make light of it - only say that Petunia and Vernon never /actually/ succeed in hitting Harry by the sound of it. There's the swipe, the threatening, etc, but most of their actual abuse is neglect and being grounded without proper access to food and stuff. They're obviously terrible guardians, but like I said before in my original comment, I like to think that Harry staying with them is actually /necessary/, that the blood protection over Petunia's house actually works, because then it's harder to just say Dumbledore was incompetent/evil. Otherwise, as I said before, there'd be fuck-all point in Harry staying there at all if nothing constructive was gotten out of it, other than the fact that the Dursleys might actually be his legal guardians as Lily's surviving relations.

Again, the issue with the Dursleys' behaviour is the way it's written in the early books. The "casual" way the pan-swipe is referred to and how you use it to say it's therefore likely a regular occurrence would certainly be true in any adult novel, but the fact is that the early Harry Potter books are oriented towards children and that it's equally likely the casual way in which it's mentioned is because Rowling didn't want to go into /graphic depictions of child abuse/ in a novel for under-10s. It's in fact perfectly possible that they don't even know that Dudley hits Harry outside of the house - they might not care if they found out - but for example, in the later books they appear not to notice that Dudley is a delinquent, who steals from children and breaks windows with stones, even when it's really obvious. They're not perceptive when it comes to their son's behaviour.

#+begin_quote
  That is probably close to waterboarding.
#+end_quote

Oh, stop it. It's really not. In larger, less well-performing English state schools - I'm going to assume that this is somehow a surprise to you - it was often common for kids to thrust each others' heads into toilet bowls as a means of bullying. It's not so much any more, with greater policing from teachers and stuff on physical bullying, plus the convenience of cyber bullying, but in the nineties it definitely would still be popular, just like fights, stealing, calling names and all the other usual shit. It is /nowhere/ even close to waterboarding, and isn't often done with the intention to drown or torture the participant, more focused on humiliation - like most bullying - than anything else. Think about when the books were written and what was commonplace in English schools at the time, and you'll start to understand why I think how I think.

Dudley's awful, but honestly he's not much worse than most idiotic kids at that time.

Waterboarding is a form of water torture in which water is poured over a cloth covering the face and breathing passages of an immobilized captive, causing the individual to experience the sensation of drowning. Despite the missing cloth part, it's pretty similar no? I'm not gonna argue about this, so if our opinions differ, then so be it.

Yes. They're appalling guardians for - as you've said - the poor-neglected-chosen-one-trope reason, but the whole beatings and physical abuse stuff that people spout is all inferences and assumptions, or misconceptions from fanfiction being transplanted into canon.

I understand perfectly what abuse is, I'm contesting the use of blanket terminology to describe what more closely resembles severe child neglect, it's own sub-division of abuse. Clarification in things like this are important, particularly because some fanfiction authors seem to fetishise the abusive side of the Dursleys to the most extreme levels.

I personally think that the abuse at the hands of the Dursleys should've had a larger effect on Harry than we see. You're right, people end up /damaged/ by shit like this, even mild neglect is enough to really affect some people. By including an abusive upbringing but also making Harry 'fairly' normal, Rowling devalues its inclusion in the first place.

But I'm never gonna believe that it was an evil scheme from Dumbledore, considering how little the two actually interacted prior to Harry's sixth year. However, if that's what you want to believe, then that's your right.

******* I'll state now that I've never been abused, and would /never/ abuse a child - I don't think it's normal, or whatever you're referring to.

I don't think I'd actually do very well at raising children, because I have little patience and in my experience children have the potential to be the cruelest beings on this planet, and as a result I don't plan on having any sprogs.

This has gotten a little out of hand, likely due to the way I worded the 'waterboarding' rebuttal. Allow me to clarify. It's absolutely cruel, but what I was trying to say is that for when the HP books were written, and where they're set, this kind of bullying was unfortunately quite commonplace, and not treated with the same kind of abhorrence that it is today. It's a sad state of affairs, but applying today's standards on bullying to what Dudley describes and comparing it to /waterboarding/, a kind of torture /condemned by most modern governments and the UN/ - except the good ol' US-of-A, of course - is in my opinion too extreme a comparison.

But regardless, I think you're missing my point. The Dursleys /do/ abuse Harry - psychologically, emotionally, and through serious neglect. All of their actions here constitute a crime that would see Harry taken into child protection for sure. The point is is that /physical/ abuse against Harry by Vernon and Petunia - beatings and the like - I'm almost certain never happen in the books. They can be inferred or assumed, but never proved.

As for Dudley, he's a cunt, and a bully for certain, but - speaking from experience here - bullies only have as much power as you allow them power. In an ideal world, you should never have to stand up for yourself against bullies because people would behave decently to each other. Unfortunately, children will /always/ find ways to be awful to each other, and then the only option is to fight back/run away/take away their fun. Bullying is about humiliation over /actual/ harm in most cases, and I stood up to potential bullies when I was in school the /first/ time they tried something against me, and they didn't try twice.

Honestly Rowling didn't try that hard to portray it as abusive, or at least examine the effects of it. Harry, despite all of his hardship, grows up fairly normal and well-adjusted (apart from teenage anger), and his situation with the Dursleys isn't actually ever made relevant to the major plot of the series. There are instances where it's important - the events leading up to Dobby's arrival in Harry's room and the aftermath in Chamber of Secrets, or Vernon's reaction to when Harry accidentally blows up Aunt Marge - but on the whole, Harry's treatment at their hands is largely ignored by the text, glossed over or casually mentioned with no further developments, so I'll have to disagree with you there.

l never once said it wasn't harmful - regardless of how alright Harry might be - the actions the Dursleys took have the potential to massively damage children. I'm trying to illustrate that physical abuse from Vernon and Petunia as often depicted in fanfiction is only alluded to, rather than outright stated. Neglect and other kinds of abuse openly happen in the books, I don't deny that, nor do I say that it isn't harmful. I'm trying to get people to clarify, since - as I've said in another comment here - some fanfiction authors fetishise physical abuse and describe it graphically for no other reason than cheap shock value, or - god forbid - they actually get off on it.

**** HP is written in 3rd Person limited PoV. It follows HP and his views throughout series. We see Magic world through his lens. Psychological abuse is still an abuse and I am sure living in cupboard is not in anyway normal? May be some families train their kids by stuffing them in cupboards for extensive periods and hence desensitization in some people but normal people don't do that. They get jailed for such abuse.

Necessary how? The only thing that's mentioned too many times is 'blood wards', which is borderline dark but I won't go into that argument yet, which is really silly. Why will Lily resurrect blood wards at Petunia's house keyed to Harry Potter when they were hiding under fidelius charm?

This story is your typical prophecy child trope with abuse the shit out of hero but he still loves everyone cliche. Parents dead? Yes. Relatives abusive? Yes. Have to save the world? Yes. IS the only person that can save? Yes.

Why was HP staying in abusive environment? Was it necessary for hero complex? I can see the pattern here.

Dumbledore's nfluence. Once again. This story is 3rd Person PoV so we don't get to see anything outside of knowledge or understanding of Harry Potter whose world view was molded under psychological and physical abuse. We see glimpse of stuff he could do. He got away with child abuse, played with ministry and avoided imprisonment at the charges of treason against government and still wasn't labeled "Wanted". He was chairman of their their International organization.

Let's understand: World knew that Dumbledore had hidden Harry Potter and nobody raised issue that why a person who shouldn't have a say in how or where Harry Potter should be raised kept quite and let him do his thing.

***** Let's just stop a second and go through all your fanon right there.

Blood wards being dark? According to whom? Which book? As far as I'm aware that's never mentioned in canon.

Lily raising the blood wards herself, and 'keying' them to Harry? FANON. Wards are never 'keyed' to anyone in the books ever, and I'm fairly sure that no-one raised the blood wards, it's instead treated as an effect of Lily's sacrifice to protect Harry, the original blood protection. He cannot be harmed thanks to Lily's love, and cannot be truly harmed where her blood resides, in this case, Petunia's house.

Why was Harry staying there? Because the Dursleys were Lily's only surviving family and would - likely - be his legal guardians? Dumbledore was the one who put Harry with them (and in a very unorthodox way), for sure, and it was for Harry's protection if the blood protection is even a thing (let's assume that it was), but in the muggle world Harry could just as easily ended up with Vernon and Petunia due to custody laws.

Every statement you make about Dumbledore's nebulous /political power/ is an assumption that isn't backed up by evidence from the books at all, and you're routinely confusing fanon with canon which is making your arguments even more incoherent. Please stop and think about it for a second.

Also, if the ICW is anything like the EU or the UN, then Dumbledore's got fuck-all power there. Do you see Jean-Claude Juncker or Ban Ki-Moon running about changing the world? Nope, they just make speeches and write strongly-worded letters and that's about it.

****** "Blood Wards" is a terrible term created in Fanon . But it fits to how things were implied in canon.

The only protection Harry Potter could get from that House would be if that protection was blood based since blood was the only thing that linked Harry Potter to his aunt's house.

Canon highlighted that protection that Harry had was due to blood. After resurrection of Voldemort using a ritual that was based around blood of Harry Potter Voldemort could /touch/ Harry Potter.

*Lily's love:* This is a silly plot device. I mean Lily can't be the only mother who threw herself between her child and a murderer. This was a children't book and children are more fascinated when things take emotional turn. They don't ask questions. Quite a convenient plot device. Dumbledore sold that bullshit to Harry too. And he bought it because he was a kid. A kid who was thirsty for love.

That Keyed part to blood wards around Petunia's house was actually what your line of thinking suggested. I don't believe on that shit. I think that was bogus. It is you who are suggesting that Harry Potter had to stay at his aunt's house because somehow Lily's love for Harry Potter created something around the house of a sister who loathed magic that protected Harry. And since blood was the only common ground between them this protection had to be based on blood. And hence the ironic 'blood wards keyed to Harry Potter' thing I said.

Personally I don't believe this kind of protection existed. I believe Lily did some ritual that gave Harry some kind of protection. My other opinion was that Harry was that powerful anyway but I dropped it after Voldemort experimentally /touched/ Harry Potter after resurrection.

Potter and Black weren't light family. James Potter was friends with darkest creature in magical world along with Sirius Black. Sirius Black plotted murder of a fellow student. This rag tag group bullied students and used nasty and harmful spells on people. Lily was a child who started out magical world as friends with a wizard who breathed dark magic like it was oxygen.

So I don't think they were Light family by any extension. The only light thing they did was join Dumbledores tea party, and it was mostly out of necessity.

Is blood magic a dark magic? Canon is silent. It's silent on most of the things because it's 3rd Person limited. Anything out of sight or hearing range of HP wasn't supposed to be explained. We saw the world through lens of HP. And HP was a damaged and abused boy who was barely surviving each year. He didn't waste time on theories about magic.

******* You can call Lily's love a silly plot device, but it's canon - unless Rowling lied to everyone, which you're perfectly capable of believing if that's your jam.

I don't believe in "wards", and I didn't intend for you to approach it with 'keying' or whatever, so sorry for being misleading, if my language led you down that route. The blood protection is in Harry's blood, it needs no wards or external constructs, and he cannot be harmed where his mother's blood resides. It needs literally no more explanation than that. If you were being - as you say - ironic, the lack of any notation as such makes it difficult to discern. We're talking through text, after all, so I can't tell if you're being ironic or sarcastic.

Sirius wanted to scare Snape, I think, daring him to go and see what Lupin got up to - but the potential for murder exists in nearly all children if they're not raised right so I there's no way I can be sure he didn't want him dead. This is me making an assumption that Sirius wasn't a total bastard.

Joining Dumbledore out of necessity? You can /assume/ that, sure, but I don't think they'd not join the only person who was actually standing up to Voldemort. What even /is/ a Light family? Again, more fanon definitions and ideas. Everyone is shades of grey, in general, so yes, the Marauders bullied, Snape loved dark magic and hated mudbloods, and Lily was apparently pretty damn smart. That doesn't mean that the ones that joined Dumbledore did so out of desperation. Maybe, I dunno, they did it because it was /right/?

And by making that statement on blood magic, you've defeated your own earlier statement - we absolutely don't know if it's dark or not, so why then say that the blood protection is "borderline dark" if /you/ know that that's just an assumption?

******** Lily was not the only mother who died protecting her son. None of those children survived Killing Curse. So love wasn't the thing that protected him. Canon is that Dumbledore told Harry Potter this his mothers love saved him. Is it true? Canon doesn't tell. Because canon isn't third person omniscient. Canon tells us things that Harry hears, sees or believes.

Forgive these terms but they are developed after long periods of use. Dark Lord, death eaters, dark creatures, dark families using dark artifacts, spells and rituals are part of canon. Fanon made term Light for those who avoid these things. Light family would be a family that avoids dark spells, rituals or artifacts. Kind of like families who live strictly by stuff they learned in DADA classes.

I don't think Potter family was 'dark free', if that's the term better suited to explain my position. Books (and movies) implied that Harry's grandma was a Black, who wasn't cast off from her family.

JK Rowling wrote this for children with Hero Vs Villain trope. That world was painted Black and White. Everything that was Black was Villain, inhumane, violent, murderer and torturer. While White was paragon of Justice, liberal and good.

Whole issue with wizarding world was that there were two groups: (1) One group didn't like it when outsiders came to their world and started changing stuff. (Kind of like how people will react if Muslims start demanidn Shriah in Muslim world or how US forces people to impose democracy). (2) Other group didn't want to allow Guns.

End result? They fought wars. One side had political clout while other had low numbers. It escalated quickly and they were at each other throats. Dark Lord seems like pretty childish name born out of idiotic Hero Vs Villain trope.

Voldemort's agenda was pretty simple: Dark creatures (werewolves, giants, veela and others) had no rights in Dumbledore's Britain. Voldemort wanted to give them rights. He was a damaged child ignored by muggle and magical worlds. He created a world where pure-bloods bowed down to a half-blood.

Blood seems very important in magical world. If used in ritual one can erect protections that can divert killing curses and same blood can be used to create a newer stronger body that can bypass blood protection. In a world like that I think half-blood and pure-blood makes a reasonable term.

********* The exact circumstances of Lily's sacrifice are, assumably, unique. Voldemort is the first and only dark wizard with so many horcruxes, I think, and that must've come into play for Harry's survival and the success of Lily's sacrifice.

As far as I'm aware, Voldemort despises all part-humans, but keeps them about for convenience. Werewolves are ferocious killers, Giants can control the tide of a battle, etc. Also the Veela (I'm fairly sure) aren't ever referred to as dark creatures in Britain or not given rights (although I'm sure Umbridge would've changed that). The way you're talking makes it sound like Voldemort somehow had good aims. I assure you, this is not the case. He says so himself, that there is no good or evil, only power. He despises pretty much all other life other than his own, which he guards viciously. He kills indiscriminately and for fun, and I don't believe that he wanted to show the purebloods what-for, and get them to unwittingly support a half-blood. In canon, Voldemort appears to be an ardent believer in their philosophy and the superiority of blood, to the point that he buries his past out of shame. You seem to have ignored Voldemort's /real/ agenda: Become immortal, take over the world, get rid of every Hogwarts house except Slytherin, kill all the mudbloods, and generally ruin everything.

Essentially it comes down to you believing things like the blood protection are BS, and me disagreeing, and neither of us being able to convince the other, so we should probably stop. I'm done arguing.

His aim? Or what Harry Potter thought his aim was? His only philosophy was "There is no good or evil, only power and those who are too weak to seek it".

He dropped his fathers name because he found out that his father dumped his Mom which created a series of events that led to isolation, torture and abuse during childhood. He was a damaged child, who was isolated and ignored during childhood.

Harry Potter and Tom Riddle had similar childhood in that regard (JK tried to make it so). Then came the Hero Vs Villain stuff where Lord Voldemort became an evil war lord and Harry became a Saviour.

Who cares what his motives are as long as dark creatures get breathing space? Every living thin is selfish. Living things are designed that way (I am an atheist and believe that evolution is a provable scientific theory. This design thing means that it's their nature). If his motives ensured jobs for dark creatures at the end of the day why hate him? It's certainly better than what ministry was doing. Lupin had to leave his job because Britain didn't allow dark creatures to work in official capacity.

He kills indiscriminately? The only kid (and their families) we know for certain that he killed, or tried to, were Harry Potter and Neville Longbottom. And it was due to prophecy.

Kill everyone except pure-blood? His greatest asset was a half blood. There were very few pure-blood families but his rogue group was quite large at last battle. Pure-blood were in it because of blood supremacy. And TBH JK Rowling did create a world in which blood had magical powers. For example: Lily's blood protect, Harry's blood necessary for ritual etc. Blood seems like a thing that can make difference.

I disagree that Lily's love created thing that manifested as blood protection. I will gladly accept if you say Lily did some ritual that created it. Lily's love and sacrifice creating such thing seem like stupid when you consider that she can't be the only mother who died for her children.

*********** So you /do/ think Voldemort was a good guy, whose racist, blood-driven new world order would've /helped/ people, even when Umbridge, who he /allowed/ to half-run his Ministry when he took over, was worse to nonhumans than the previous administration?

I'm washing my hands of this. I understand Dumbledore-bashers, I understand all of that, but the second you start implying that Voldemort, basically /wizard Hitler/ isn't the bad guy in these stories, despite killing Amelia Bones, Lily and James, Snape, and a whole bunch of other people you seem to have forgotten about when I said he kills indiscriminately, /because he does/, then there's fuck-all point talking to you.

#+end_quote

Racist? In real life race doesn't hinder or improve performance. Thus it's wrong to judge people on their race. Magical world was divided on their opinion about BLOOD. And Blood seems to be a difining factor in that world. It had magical properties. It can give protection. It can help you resurrect once more. It can create new bodies. It can be used in rituals that can curse you.

That's a plot hole, no? Dark creatures were part of Voldemort's army. Dark creatures were pushed out of official posts in era of people who hated anything dark. Isn't DADA part of curriculum in a school that's run by greatest wizard who fought against dark lords and dark creatures?

Either JK Rowling screwed with Umbridge or Umbridge wasn't part of Voldemort's army.

I'm implying that world isn't black and white. Good and Evil aren't the only realities. People aren't dark and evil just for evil's sake. People have ambitions and methods that might come off as questionable. Voldermot's version that Harry Potter had in his mind is evil. No doubt. But is Voldemort really what we see him through lens of a manipulated and biased child that was molded to shoulder a war at 11 years of age?

People die when they participate in wars. Didn't 'good' people kill 'bad' people? Even JK Rowling had some sense to have 'good' people kill too instead of writing stories where every 'good' people won by using ticking spells. Though she ended it with Chosen one killing Darkest Lord with a disarming spell.
