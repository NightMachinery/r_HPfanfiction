I recently got back to trying to read Harry Potter fanfiction but am failing to find anything that interests me, which is very surprising, since this fandom rather large and has been going on for almost 20 years now.

The problem is that I'm looking for something well written that sticks relatively close to canon and does not focus on shipping, also I'm not as young as I used to be myself and find it difficult to get into stories that are obviously written by young teenagers...

I have started with searching for specific kind of stories but failed to find anything I like at all and am getting a bit desperate so if there are any stories that fit the description above that you think are a must read, please recommend.

If there is a master thread of recommendations I just missed then please forgive my post and point me in the right direction.

  Remus's mind is usually a tidy place. The worst has already happened, what's left to be scared of? His fears are labelled, annotated, and most of all, archived. For one evening, though, he'll have to let them come out and play. (Remus trains the Boggart for his lesson with the third years. Featuring Severus Snape as an unwanted critic, and Sirius Black as the elephant in the room.)

**** Well I'm 54, so certainly not a child, nor do I think I write for children but some of my work is romance and all of my longer work has some sort of relationship development in the background or as a sub plot. I think most stories do. Do you mean you don't want to see any relationships at all?

***** No, that's not what I mean at all (also, thank god, I started suspecting that I was just too old for the fandom, after all, Harry Potter is kind of a series for children and teenagers). What I mean is I personally do not want to see any of the given marriages that were formed after the traumatic war events broken up for no good reason other than to put two ppl together that the writer likes better. (e. g. Ginny loses interest after 3 children and Harry falls in love with Luna Lovegood and also Ron is an idiot and Hermione has been secretly in love with Draco, who, if I remember correctly, actually loves his wife so much he did not want her to go through the dangers of pregnancy and childbirth, that kind of thing)

I have nothing against relationships developing in the background as long as the stories are solid, but many stories focus rather heavily on romance and I'm failing to find anything with a good plot where romance is really just in the background.

A huge problem I have with HP fanfiction is that characters are often out of character to fit the stories, Snape suddenly treating Harry like his own son just because he realized the Dursleys are not treating him well? Dumbledore being malicious and stupid and everybody hates him? When I see things like Harry/Bellatrix I really cannot click on the link...

** Looking through my favourites found the following. I might make a couple of small slip ups as I've gone through these quickly and might have misremembered them a little.

​

*Post-DH canon-compliant:*

linkffn(An Interview With Justin FinchFletchley)

sort of linkffn(Muggle Saturday by plinker5x5) - this one does talk about relationships but is more just a funny misunderstanding than romance.

linkffn(Cousin Harry by nicnac918) and its sequel (Uncle Harry by nicnac918) explore a future where Dudley's children have magic. In the same vein are linkffn(Perfectly Normal Thank You Very Much by Casscade) and linkffn(Dudley's Memories by paganaidd) - I can't remember which is best.

​

*Mid-series canon-compliant:*

linkffn(The Wandmaker's Escape by White Squirrel) slight deviation from canon in that Luna and Ollivander escape from Malfoy Manor themselves.

Sort of linkffn(The Assassin Wore White by apAidan) why St Mungos was never outright attacked by Voldemort.

linkffn(Goldstein by Laazov) canon told from the point of view of Anthony Goldstein, if he were from a strongly religious family.

​

*Canon-compliant but then sensible time travel:*

linkffn(A Little Child Shall Lead Them) Hermione goes back in time post-canon to stop the war.

(I thought there were more of these but I can't figure out which time travel ones are canon compliant or not from just a glance)

​

Although it doesn't quite fit your criteria, I do wonder if you might enjoy linkffn(The Sea King by Doghead Thirteen)

​

I really really hope some of these are up your street! And I hope I haven't broken the poor bot >_<

*** Nah, I'm just looking for something that's not too OOC and doesn't change anything in the books. Fanfiction does not only cover things that could have gone differently but also prequels and sequels and the "deleted scenes" that could have fit seamlessly into the story, doesn't it? (Or doesn't it in this fandom?) Another possibility I've tried to find but failed is a back in time story that isn't OOC where the character that travels back just creates an alternate timeline where everything turns out even better and the original timeline is not changed. Btw everybody says time travel is an old trope and there have been too many stories to cound but I have yet to find one that I can read to the end...

Also maybe it's just that I really don't need any of the marriages after the war to be split up for random reasons so that Harry and Draco or Draco and Hermione or Harry and Luna can be together...

Then he finds out that he's apparently a part of a pure-blood nobility he's never heard of; he's Lord Potter and Lord Black. Unfortunately, that revelation's come too late for him to be a reformer.

Nightmares of Future Past really does sound like what you're wanting as far as time travel stories, so I do recommend that one.

Everything else I can think of that I like that keeps all the canon ships gets rather AU in other ways, so probably not what you're looking for, but if you want stories where things get AU after the epilogue without breaking the canon ships let me know and I'll see what I've got.

  In the morning after the Battle of Hogwarts, Harry felt tired. In the morning after the morning after, he was downright exhausted. The war may be over, but there are still battles to be fought.

  CoS according to Ginny. Nobody noticed anything wrong for an entire year -- how did she slip so far from her family and friends? Angst and betrayal, but also mysteries, jokes, an enchanted suit of armor, and a guaranteed happy ending.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/][The Sum of Their Parts by holdmybeer]]

A post war fic that diverges some time after the battle of Hogwarts (no epilogue, and no pairings). It explores the idea of what would happen if after the second war everything went back to the way it was before just like the first war, and how the trio would react after all they lost. Also the way Harry reacts is very much something Harry would do. It is a bit extreme, but as usual in Harry's life, extreme measures are necessary.

** I know the struggle, because those are exactly the type of stories I look for too. I think there are only a handful of them, nothing comes to my mind except one shots that are too short for their own good.

If I may suggest my own story (I'm not sure if this is exactly what you're looking for), I try to keep everyone in character as much as possible. Although there are background relationships (all canon), it's not focused on romance, but rather on family.

  Post-OotP --- Sirius is cleared and finally gets to give Harry the home he had always wanted. Rebuilding his life with a war brewing in their world isn't simple. It's a good thing he has a family that he can fall back on this time. OR What if Sirius never fell through the veil but lives instead? Harry & Sirius family fic. Canon divergence after OotP to DH but compliant. No Slash.
