Hey,

I'm looking for a story I have read a long time ago where Dumbles always ends up drinking too much fire whiskey before destroying his office. I think this mostly happened after he tried to get control of Harry and fucked up.\\
Lucious Malfoy also started a lot of fire whiskey... since his plans didn't go well either.

I hope anyone can help me with this :D ty!


** Sounds like a crack fic I vaguely remember. I think it's that Harmony GoF fic where Ron becomes a champion. Don't remember the name, but I recall a firewhiskey manufacturer commenting on how Hogwarts' order has doubled since the tournament started. Barty Jr was also drinking copiously.

  Harry allows Ron to compete for him in the tournament. How does he fare? This is a Harry/Hermione story with SERIOUSLY Idiot!Ron Bashing. If that isn't what you like, please read something else. Complete but I do expect to add an alternate ending or two.
