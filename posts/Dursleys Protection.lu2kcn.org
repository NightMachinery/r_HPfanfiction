Is there any fic out there focused on what Dursleys were doing during the events of Deathly Hallows?


** Something like “Dudley Dursley and the Bee Hive by Jmso” linkao3(14869065)?

  This is the story of the Dursley familys perspective of things. After a small chapter of the Order planning for the Dursleys safehouse, it starts off with Petunia Evans´s childhood and what happened to her back then that made her behave so unreasonably strict towards Harry Potter. The main story however, tells us what happens to the Dursley family after they left no 4 Privet Drive to hide from Lord Voldemort. They were leaving with a witch and a wizard and something were bound to happpen between them.The story mainly reveals where the Dursleys went and who they met. How they would endure to be surrounded with magic, and what they did on a day to day basis. It contains a bit of magic, just enough to intrigue some family members and scare another. Some known names from the Potter books are mentioned, together with a couple of new introductions I made up. The story includes the Dursleys dealing with magic, oversized bumble bees, a murder, and a battle amongst other things.
