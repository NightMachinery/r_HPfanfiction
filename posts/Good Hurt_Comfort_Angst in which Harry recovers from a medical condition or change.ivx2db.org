** I would think Birth Of A Phoenix is a pretty good one, although it is quite AU in which Harry has a twin and siblings but the relationships the author has built is pretty good and conveys raw emotions quite well. linkffn(Birth Of A Phoenix)

#+begin_quote
  Complete. No pairings. Twin:Harry. Fatally ill Harry runs away for years only to return when his twin brother needs him the most. Being discovered he starts to crumble to his illness. Includes Character Death but that isn't the end for him.
