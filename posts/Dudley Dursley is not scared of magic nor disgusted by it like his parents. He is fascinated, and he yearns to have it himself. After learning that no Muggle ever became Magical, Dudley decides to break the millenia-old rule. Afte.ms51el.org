#+TITLE: Dudley Dursley is not scared of magic nor disgusted by it like his parents. He is fascinated, and he yearns to have it himself. After learning that no Muggle ever became Magical, Dudley decides to break the millenia-old rule. After all, weren't the Fae supposed to grant wishes like that for a price?

  When only one Hogwarts letter arrives for identical twin sisters, Juliet and Jennifer Belstone find themselves separated for the first time in their lives. Desperate to be reunited, they ask...could a Squib ever become a witch? And so their quest begins: a difficult and dangerous search for a source of magical power. Can they ever bridge the divide?
