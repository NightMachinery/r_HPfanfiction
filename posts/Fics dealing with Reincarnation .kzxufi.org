I was hoping to read fics dealing with the subject of reincarnation preferably with some of the more prominent characters.


** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6486690/1/Rebirth][Rebirth]] by Athey. Two boys grow up together in an orphanage, grow powerful at school, are torn apart by death and brought back together by rebirth. Horcruxes aren't the only way to live forever. Necromancy, reincarnation, TR/HP Slash dark!Harry. unfinished. FFNet.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7319686/1/][Old Souls]] by Patricia pc. He died trying to save the universe... thousands of years in the future. Now he's back in his reincarnation of 1926. Meet Charles, one of the many reincarnations of Harry Potter. He comes to 1930 with Big Plans, none that involved Tom Riddle. FFNet.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/26362207][To Live is the Rarest thing]] by Maeglin-Yedi. A disastrous trip to a waterpark (thanks, Dudley!) unleashes almost 200 lifetimes worth of memories, and now Harry is stuck as a ten-year-old while his soulmate is a wraith set on killing him.

A very old and cynical Harry sets about correcting Tom's poor life-choices while avoiding Dumbledore and his Order's panicked searches for the Boy Who Disappeared.

As far as Harry is concerned, the whole world can fuck off. He couldn't care less he's finally Harry Potter again, or that he can finally see his original loved ones again. The only thing that matters is getting Tom back safe and sane and with his soul intact. WIP. Ao3.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11907443/1/][Full Circle]] by Tetshurashian. Harry and Tom's souls are tied together. Which is why they're in this endless loop of rebirth. At some point, they stopped caring and just started fucking with people. (slightly crack AU w/ some seriousness) MoD!Harry, kinda soulmates!TMRHP SLASH M/M. FFNet.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22945375][The difference a Soul makes]] by FalconLux. Thanks to a ritual in his first life, he's been reincarnating for millennia. Every death has resulted in being born anew nine months later. He's always magical, always male, and always in possession of all his memories, but always in a different body and of a different family. This time, he has been born to a naive young couple with high ideals and little understanding but an enormous well of love for their son that he cannot fault. This time, he is called Harry Potter. WIP. Ao3.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6671596/1/A-Necessary-Gift-A-Harry-Potter-Story][A Necessary Gift- a Harry Potter Story]] by Cosette Amiee. The war drags on after Voldemort's defeat and the Order of the Phoenix is fighting a losing battle. When Harry is hit by yet another killing curse, he wakes up years in the past and in an alternate reality. As an unknown child in a foreign world, Harry has a chance to change the outcome of the war - while dealing with new magical talents, pureblood politics and Black family drama. FFNet.
