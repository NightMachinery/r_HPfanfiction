I tried to read this story but it was absolutely littered with trigger warnings. The first chapter (which I couldn't even finish!) had three warnings of "blood" and one "graphic description of injuries." It was even rated M? It really wasn't even gruesome or anything.

Are trigger warnings common?


** I wouldn't say that they're common in the form that you posted (that seems a bit overboard).

I do, however, frequently see explanations at the start of a story for why the author gave that rating, which is nice (especially if I don't feel like reading a "Dursleys physically abuse Harry" or "Harry/Draco slash" story).

** I see them around occasionally, and sometimes the author is just going overkill- like the one you mentioned. Every once in a while I'll find a fic where they just have a warning on one chapter for a suicide or character death. I feel like the latter is appropriate, and the former is just kind of ignorant.

I guess I tend to avoid angsty fics, so I don't come across them often.

**** Yeah, thinking on it more, I'd have to agree with that. There's not really any point to writing scenes like that if you're giving it away beforehand.

** They're fairly common, but not ubiquitous. People have different sensitivities and standards, just like some people are horrified by the notion of including sexual violence in a Potterverse story while others seem to be unable to resist completing a paragraph without some sort of outré transgression. Also there's probably some correlation between frequency of trigger warnings and membership within various subgroups within the fandom, e.g. stereotypically the Tumblr crowd is more likely to care about trigger warnings, non-gender binary stuff, terms like "wixen" rather than wizard, etc.

I tend to mentally categorize trigger warnings under "not important to me but important to some and cost me nothing so why not."

*** I personally dislike the 'tumblr crowd' as you call them for putting up trigger warings about the most banal of things at times. It often times takes all of the suspense out of an FF if it says in the introduction: "Oh and there will be [important plot point here] and [another important plot point here] but X will not actually die, so there's that. LOL"

There is a rating system on FFs. If I click on an M or E rated FF then I can't complain when the content turns out to actually be 'mature' or 'explicit' even if I find that I don't like it.

**** Giving away the plot isn't a trigger warning it's just condescending to one's audience. "Warning: story includes rape and emotional abuse" is a trigger warning. "Omg guyz I dont rly kill hermione read my next chapter and relax jklol" is just stupid.

***** Sometimes I even feel that that can give away to much. Especially something like "Major character death". I see how it's neccessary, though and since I've used it in the past to avoid certain kinds of stories I really shouldn't complain.

****** MCD warnings /baffle/ me. I put them on my fic because people moaned at me about it, but I just don't get it. This is fiction, of course you can expect characters to die; why should I have to warn you about it? Especially with something like HP where the source material kills off major characters. Most warnings I get--rape and violence can be hard for victims of abuse to handle, and matters like drugs and alcohol could be triggering for recovering addicts--but I simply don't understand MCD warnings.

********* Fanfiction is special as a writing form because the readers have a direct channel back to the writer. There was considerable crying and yelling when Sirius died but JKR didn't have to hear it from thousands of overly-sensitive readers.

In that sense, trigger warnings exist to protect the writer from whiny readers. To maintain suspense while still using them, I like to seed a sample of a bad event early on in a story, as a taste of what's to come. This acts as both a polite litmus test, giving the reader a chance to 'nope' before we get to the hard stuff, and as a piece of foreshadowing.

Other times I just kill a relevant character in the first scene, so people will assume that's what I'm referring to with the warning. One might see this as the George R.R. Martin form of trigger warning.

********** Not for everyone! For some the point of fanfiction is to read more about a world that you loved so much - to see what kind of fascinating things other people have thought of, inspired by this fandom you love so much.

Sometimes, fanfics make me cry. I love the ones that can, because those /mean/ something. Actually, I love the ones that can make me laugh, too. I don't often do either when reading, so I know how much the writer is offering their readers when they manage it.

*********** I don't believe I tried to speak for everyone...? I've heard of plenty of authors that adore torturing their characters and making them as miserable as possible. I've heard of people who think stories that make them cry are "deeper" or more "profound" and, implicitly, better/more important. Thus, literary merit. There's some quote that apparently you should suffer emotionally while reading, because that means the book is challenging your beliefs, or whatever. Well more power to those people! But that's not what I want to read, and when I'm spending hours and hours or days, giving up sleep to read a story, and become emotionally attached to a character, and then that character /dies/..... Well, I'm happy there's a huge geographical distance between me and the author. Some stories are good despite this. Tozette's Hit the Ground Running is still amazing and I love it.... Right up until the last chapter. But then an even /greater/ time investment is necessitated to rewrite the ending to soothe the emotional upheaval, and most of the time it's not worth it and I just don't want to /deal/ with that shit! So by all means, kill off and torture your characters... But mark it off so I don't make the mistake of reading it.

************ Well, I was more directing your "that's the point of fanfiction" - when really, it isn't. Just pointing out there isn't one point of fanfiction, haha.

I understand your feelings, I like using fanfiction to escape reality myself sometimes. But I also enjoy going into it just like I would with a real novel - with nothing but a blurb on the back telling me what I'm in for.

********* Who said anything about literature? Literature is what I analysed all day through high school, regardless of having to remind myself for hours after it that /my/ life didn't actually suck! it was just the characters who had had every injustice and misfortune in the world heaped upon them and I had unfortunately empathised with them to the level that it felt like I was them. *Fanfiction* is what makes me happy! and having to rage-quit or grief-quit a fanfiction because my mood and sense of self are literally not strong enough to distinguish reality from the story, and the story fucking suck because everybody dies or is broken, is not what I want to do with my spare time. I'd rather read a math textbook than the emotional trauma that is characters dying.

But thank you for your opinion =) I'm glad to have set a new bar for you xo

**** I dislike the idea most of the time as well, but they /do/ sometimes have a place.

For instance, [[http://hp.adult-fanfiction.org/story.php?no=600021832][Mad Snorkacks & Englishmen]] has to be my favorite Harry/Luna story ever. That said, there are some seriously screwed situations that could definitely set someone off who has been sexually assaulted.

I'm not against warnings when the subject is serious. My problem comes in when you have those oversensitive morons who want a warning on /fucking everything/.

** Depends, I's say. I've seen authors go overboard with tags on AO3. They give the whole plot away in the tags sometimes. I rarely see trigger warnings in the actual text, however. Sometimes I get a warning before a sex scene or a bloody battle or a torture scene but these are usually at the start of the chapter, not in the middle of the text body.

** Only in the Wormverse. On the plus side, trauma = powers there! I tried writing a straight Worm/HP crossover once. It can be summed up as saying 'Scion shows up just after Voldemort's defeat. Villainous Strangers, Masters and Thinkers discover existence of wizarding world in 1986. And then there was fire. Lots and lots and lots of fire. Harry gets 'volunteered' by the PRT after triggering at age six and getting picked up by a woman wearing a classy hat almost immediately. Hogwarts classified as a national monument in 1990 to commemorate the end of the 'hidden age of capes'. Voldemort posesses someone, runs into Greyboy. Scion is felled by a mysterious green beam. The. End'

Paradoxically, Harry has a happier time of it. Hermione kills Eidolon and the Siberian (triggers with perfect post-cognition, meaning that she gets to learn ALL THE MAGICS EVER on top of knowing who is responsible for the endbringers) before assuming a new identity and going to live with her cousin Annette in the US. A couple of years later, Clockblocker calls bullshit.

And that's as far as I got.
