So I've been reading murkybluematter's Harriet Potter series. And on paper, I should really not like this fic. Over powered Harry? Check. Magic being quantifiable? Check. Golden Trio? (Check, though here Harry is in the Silver Trio.) Lords/Ladies? Check.

But I ended up really enjoying the first three fics in the series.

So I'm wondering if anyone else has come across a fic that based on their usual preferences they should hate, but ended up really enjoying.

linkffn(11574569)\\
When I first read the title and summary, I was like "ohhhh boy, here we go again!"\\
I was actually really surprised by it and now it's on my most anticipated list and I always get really excited when I see an update email about it. I even woke up earlier today because the author mentioned it would be updated today.\\
I would say give it a shot. It sounds really tropey, and it is, but I still found myself heavily enjoying it.

*** Definitely this one, as it contains:

Wrong BWL and bad Potters

Evil Dumbledore

Lord Slytherin

Harem

Betrothal Contracts

Over mature 10 years old

Ice Princess of Slytherin

(Almost) pureblood Hermione

Overpowered Luna

Magic Core

Quantifiable Magic

But that story is damn fun to read!

**** This and OP's Pureblood Pretense are two of the only fics I really look forward to updates for atm. It's really weird because I can't even get my friends to try these out because they seem really dodgy on paper, but I know they would love it if they could push past the first few chapters of trope.

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10473466/1/Fate-be-Changed][Fate be Changed]] is, for me, a singularly confusing work.

I mean, it ticks so many of those boxes that I use as early warning signs:\\
* Suspiciously OC 'Harry' ('Harry' is a hobbit. And a girl. And bears basically no actual relation to 'Harry' at all) * Dangerously Mary Sue (She's a hobbit, trained as a ranger, who kills three trolls, alone) * Hobbit/Dwarf relations * Kíli/Tauriel (Thanks, movies) * Concealed gender (DRAMA FOR THE DRAMA GOD) * No Harry Potter magic at all * Basically a re-hash plot

And yet, I find myself loving it. I don't really know why. It just seems to have a kind of heartfelt authenticity to it that I can't help but enjoy. The characters feel like people rather than shallow caricatures, and it is clear that the author just plain loves them to bits. It has so many of the tropes of shallow wish fulfilment, and yet it manages to be so much more. It makes me wonder if there's a Harry/Draco story out there that I won't hate.

It even made me go out and try some Bagginshield (though I still kept to the fem!Bilbo variety).

** It is rare that I like a fic that doesn't match my general reading preferences, but linkffn(1349676) certainly goes against a lot of what I generally look for in fanfiction.

It is romance heavy and has significantly OOC characters, certainly not my favorite combination. There are other cliches as well, like the whole Everyone-dates-Slytherins thing. I like the writing, the dialogue is authentic, and I do like the Quidditch-playing-girls premise, but I still don't think it is something I /should/ have liked. It lasted the whole bus ride and entertained me, though, so I can't say it didn't do its job.

** linkffn(Sacrificial Second Chance).

I normally don't read badly written fics at all, but this one is just readable enough that I kept on and there's something so compelling about this version of Harry going to an alternate world and trying to make amends for everything his evil counterpart did to hurt people and rebuild trust with them.

** linkffn(Their Verdict of Vagaries) is full of typos and overuses the word "blatantly," to the point that I was tempted to start counting. If I didn't know anything about the story but that, I would never read it. But the plot (and it's super long) happens to be perfectly suited to my tastes. It's got Harry/Tom and Harry gradually goes Dark over many years, but never gives up on his mission of neutralizing Voldemort. I've read it two or three times because I just get the urge once every year or so.
