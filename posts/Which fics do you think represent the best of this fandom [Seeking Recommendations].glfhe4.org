Been reading fics since I was in my teens, however I find that my tastes have changed a bit. Not much tolerance for bad writing (I'll stick through a few chapters for the authors to find their stride, but not more). Face the same issue with recommending fics to friends, feels like we've grown out of the core demographic (in mid-20s). Not really a fan of Slash, H/Hr unless it's really well done (e.g linkffn(Blindness)). Sucker for well rounded characters and minimal/no bashing (linkffn(On the Way to Greatness) , linkao3(Dead Things) , linkffn(Cauterize) , linkffn(Stages of Hope), linkffn(Realignment)), anything by Little0bird, Annerb, FloreatCastellum) etc. Guilty pleasures include some crack fics, power trips like linkffn(The Sum of Their Parts). Sorry if this is too specific.


** All of Northumbrian's work but especially Strangers at Drakeshaugh, which is from the perspective of Harry and Ginny's non-magic neighbor. Unique and fascinating. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1623053/chapters/3460562]]

If you like little0bird's post-war book try These Cuts I Have by Melindaleo and it's sequel. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11317075/1/These-Cuts-I-Have]]

I will recommend one slash fic because it's my absolute favorite fic and the one I would definitely suggest if you're trying to convince an adult of the potential of fanfiction. It's The Man Who Lived, and it's the story of Draco living in New York after the war. Smart, funny, moving, great OCs, character development - despite being fanfiction it's on my list of best reads over the past 5 years, period.

*** Not a huge fan of slash either, but holy shit Second String is /phenomenal/. Easily one of my favorite reads of the last few years, fanfic or otherwise.

*** I'm not normally a fan of Draco at all, but I gotta second The Man Who Lived. Absolutely spectacular story. I went into it thinking that it was a completely unrealistic premise (Draco Malfoy living in Muggle New York, having essentially cut himself off from the Wizarding World? Yeah okay buddy) but damn, the author sells it so well. It's one of two fanfics that have ever gotten me genuinely choked up.

***** Out of the Blue, the epilogue/sequel to [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10057010/chapters/22409387][All the Young Dudes]]. The realization that after everything, the whole story is still more or less canon-compliant really messed with me. I still definitely recommend that series though, it's fantastic.

*** linkffn(6432055)

Exile is also an extremely well done Draco in the muggle world fic. It's an awesome coming of age and overcoming trauma story. It's one of the most realistic and convincing redemption stories I've read.

  After the war, Draco is saved by his late grandfather's foresight. With his unanswered questions outnumbering the stars in the sky, he struggles to come to terms with reality. Will he fail yet again? Canon compliant. Prequel to my next-generation-series.

** Gotta agree with Realignment - found that one recently and omg. It was /not/ what I was expecting, and it was oh so very good.

A recent and (I thought) really well done crack fic is The Crownless King - a covid inspired Time Travel / Raises Himself / MoD fic where he hordes toilet paper. He doesn't like Dumbledore, but there isn't really any bashing involved. He's also a little bit insane and hides TP under the bed. linkao3(23382799)

Other stories I have filed away under 'amazing' include:

- Hiding in Plain Sight, another crack fic where wizards are gullible. linkffn(8937860)

- Grey Space, where Harry goes to Stonewall High: linkao3(12424344)

- And the Wolves All Cry, a dystopian AU where the prophecy wasn't heard by Snape and therefore not given to Voldemort. linkffn(8809533)

They aren't the only ones I have listed as great, but the rest are crossovers.

  In 1991, Harry Potter begins his time at Stonewall High, unaware that he is anything more than a boy prone to freakish accidents. When he turns fourteen, he will receive a letter that will change his life. He will learn he is Harry Potter, and be invited into a world where belonging is his birthright. Until then, he stumbles on, two steps forward and one step back, out of the cupboard and into the life he was never meant to have.

** Evitative is in my top 3 of all time. It's a Harry that is resorted into Slytherin, with believable character changes, and only a bit of slash at the very end. linkao3(evitative by vichan)

A Cadmean Victory linkffn(a cadmean victory) is also incredible, and is my all time favorite Harry/Fleur fic.

linkffn(Harry Potter & the Wizarding World: Book 1 - Dark Arts by Seprith Li Castia) is also amazing. Unfortunately, while the fic is complete, the author never continued with the series. SLC is still active(last posting on March 23), but only in other fandoms.

The Negligentia series by Murkatroyd is very well written as well. linkffn( Negligentia by Murkatroyd) linkffn( Negligentia: Absque by Murkatroyd) linkffn(Negligentia: Optate by Murkatroyd)

The Serpent's Gaze is a very long(and abandoned, grr) take on Slytherin! Harry that I enjoyed because it was far from a canon rehash. The author even came up with original plots for a few of the books. linkffn(The Serpent's Gaze by DictionaryWrites)

This one, linkffn(Strangest Reflections by LeQuin) is a H/Hr fic, but it is well written, and the only bashing isn't mindless bashing(it's well reasoned). The premise is interesting as well, and it's one of my favorites.

  In the summer before his fifth year at Hogwarts, Harry is drawn to a room in Grimmauld Place. Like the Gryffindor he is, he enters the room without fear. The room is a library, and Harry is surprised to find that he's eager to learn. Then he gets the bad news: he's been accidentally expelled from Hogwarts, and he needs to be sorted again. Everyone is confident that he'll go straight back to Gryffindor, but with what he's been learning, Harry's not so sure.

** One of the more popular ones on here is definitely Linkffn(Prince of Slytherin)

I'd also second Cadmean Victory and Soul Scars as being very well written.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** One of the best written HP fanfics I've ever read is: linkffn(2954601) . It's a Harry/Ginny fic based in 6th year where Harry starts training seriously for the war. However, his paranoia about Dumbledore trying to stop him as well as differences in opinion between himself, Ron and Hermione cause rifts to occur in their friendship. The author does toe the line of bashing Ron and Hermione at times but it's never an outright bashing fest that you see in other fics. Sadly the sequel only has a few chapters to it's name and was abandoned years ago. However this is a complete story so it's well worth the read.
