Title says it all, looking for fics where there is significant worldbuilding. Looking for something where it feels like there is a huge magical world beyond Hogwarts or Britain. The massive divergence is not necessary but I've seen more of such worldbuilding in AUs.

Examples of fics:

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Untitled Tome; Skitterleap; Prince of the Dark Kingdom)


** Linkffn(a long journey home by rakeesh; the pureblood pretense by murkybluematter; the long game by inwardtransience; reign of the serpent; the crown of metis)

*** I've read the first half of the first part of Pureblood Pretense and it's terribly medicore. The core idea is pretty interesting, but there is not much done with the changed world and what I've seen so far about potioneering and spellcasting was really weak. Does it get better?

Similar for The Long Game, but there I've only read the first chapter. The clunky infodumps in both text and author notes and abduance of overused cliches made me leave it for now. So, similar question here. Does it get better?

**** The infodumps in the long game get more infrequent but don't go away, sadly. Pacing gets a bit better but is still an issue when the author gets sidetracked showing off their world building. But the characters of Charissa and Lily are worth plowing through linguistic and cultural asides, imo. They're both awesome in different ways and interestingly flawed. The Lord/Lady Potter stuff is taken further than in most fics, and the British wizarding world is explicitly based on feudal culture, with drawbacks and advantages shown.

The pureblood pretense does get better. The potioneering gets more intense and incorporates the core ideas in later books, and the twists to canon plots are fun. I liked the climax of PP, simple though it is in comparison to the later ones. Also more of the political arena gets fleshed out (though she is NOT a player because of her age, she observes the adults in her life play the game) and the lengths she goes to keep her secret get intense. She solves one problem and the next one pops up. And her past psychological/magical trauma gets explored later too- there's a lot of psychology (she spends a lot of time in her magical 'mindscape' making it resistant to penetration, and her personality is reflected in her mind magic- it gets meta sometimes) in the fic as well as outside perspectives on her that illustrate how warped her self-image and magic can be.

(Also I love the Alanna series so that ties into my enjoyment of it.)

  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.

  Britain has been at peace for nearly a century --- protected from the devastation of Grindelwald's war, free of conflict of their own. Charissa Potter, raised surrounded by family and friends more numerous than she can count, never really expected this to change. But hidden forces, it seems, have been playing a long game.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) feels like a clichéd WBWL story at the beginning but really develops into an elaborate magical world with interesting takes on magic. It also attempts to subvert some of the tropes found in WBWL fics. Second year is especially a blast.

linkffn(More Equal Than You Know) has some of the best ideas on wandlore, the Deathly Hallows, and just magic in general that I've seen in any fic. Pity it seems to be abandoned.

I've also heard very good things about the world building in linkffn(Wit of the Raven) though I couldn't personally get into it beyond a few chapters. Has an utterly (and purposely) OOC Hermione.

linkffn(Shadow of Angmar) is a crossover with LotR and has a very interesting "poetic" take on potions.

** [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/AuthorStories-22082/DianeCastle.htm][DianeCastle]] has created a massive world in "Terawattverse". The 660k words long [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]], often recommended here, is merely the first installment of a long series. Its sequel, [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-26436-17/DianeCastle+The+League+of+Extraordinary+Women.htm][The League of Extraordinary Women]], is a massive crossover involving 6 different universes. A DH compliant HPverse Hermione had to collect six female heroes from 5 other universes to stop an invasion from the hell dimension. The other six were Sam Carter from SG1, Selina Kyle from Justice League, Jaime the Bionic Woman, Buffy and Willow from the Vampire Slayers, and Alex Mack from the Terawattverse.

The next installment of this series is [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-28614/DianeCastle+The+Secret+Return+of+Alex+Mack.htm][The Secret Return of Alex Mack]]. It has almost 1.2M words and features the main character of this universe, Alex Mack, aka superhero Terawatt. The Trio from this universe makes several appearances, and Hermione is mentioned about 1600 times here.

All above three stories are finished. The author has announced that she will soon begin posting /Hermione Granger and the Swiss Tournament/.

** Matou Shinji Series: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10918531/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Philosopher-s-Stone][Matou Shinji and the Philosopher's Stone]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11070121/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Heirs-of-Slytherin][Matou Shinji and the Heirs of Slytherin]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11407944/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Master-of-Death][Matou Shinji and the Master of Death]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11686212/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Broken-Chains][Matou Shinji and the Broken Chains]] - It's a crossover between Harry Potter, Nasuverse, and the Assassins Creed, but it doesn't require knowledge of either. Matou Shinji, the protagonist, is unable to become magus and that makes him failure to his family. He would completely break, but he gets a letter from Hogwarts. Wanting praise and attention he focuses on giving his best to succeed at witchcraft. Will he obtain what he seeks? What will come with his friendship with Boy-Who-Lives? And why Hogwarts? Featuring two Voldemorts, rapist tanuki, Draco Malfoy working part-time at Saint Mungo and assassin creating elite school club. Nice blend of obscure elements or both settings with author original ideas. Features Mahoutokoro, Durmstrang, and original magical school. Ongoing, with currently irregular updates.
