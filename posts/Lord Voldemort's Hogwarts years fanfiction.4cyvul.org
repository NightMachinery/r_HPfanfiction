  !COMPLETE! The story of Lord Voldemort's life, from the moment he becomes a wizard to the moment he dies. Everything---Slug Club, Horcruxes, Chamber of Secrets, Death Eaters, working at Borgin's, both wars, banishment, resurrection. With details of what happened in Albania. Names and dates are all canon. Gets significantly darker as the story progresses.

** We Found Wonderland by scarecrowing - linkffn(10949411) has Hermione travelling back in time and going to school with Tom Riddle.

It's a bit tricky to read at first - the author didn't format things very well - but it gets better once he got a really terrific beta reader :)

It hasn't been updated for a while but it's definitely not abandoned.

  Hermione Granger has always been exceptional. When the war with Voldemort is finally over, it has taken everything from her. Including her ability to die properly, it seems. And now she's in the 1940s, living in an orphanage. What could possibly go wrong? Only time will tell.

** linkffn(10857053) - Harry time travels back. I haven't quite found a fic that captures Tom's frightening relationship with his peers/unspoken politics in Slytherin the way this does. The interactions between everyone in Slytherin and all the things that go unsaid are emphasized heavily by the fact that from Harry's POV, you're just as baffled as he is. Gen fic.

  An accident in sixth year strands Harry in 1942 and a split second decision leaves him in an intrigue-ridden Slytherin. Lies and secrets shroud the board. Wizard's chess has never been Harry's best game, and the path to the black king is covered with thorns. Become 'friends' with Tom Riddle? If only it were so easy.
