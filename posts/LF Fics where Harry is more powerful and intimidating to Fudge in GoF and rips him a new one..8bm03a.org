I am looking for fics where Harry is more powerful and angry with Fudge in the hospital wing at the end of Goblet of Fire, so much so that he tears Fudge apart until he caves or something similar.

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family, and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4. Sequel posted.
