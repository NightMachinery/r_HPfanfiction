** Hehe, no, you're not the only one who enjoys angst. It's my favourite genre, so I could easily give you a ton of recs. However, I read a lot of slash, especially Snarry, and I don't know if you're into that. If not, you can of course ignore those suggestions. I'll give you a few gen fics too, just in case.

*Gen*

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/469359][Morior Animus]] linkao3(469359). In order to defeat Voldemort, Harry has to be killed, and Snape is the only one who can do it. This is such a beautiful, moving, subtle fic. It feels longer than 15k words, because so much is implied between the lines. Highly recommended if you enjoy stories that pack a punch by being quiet and understated.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3082463][To Dwell on Dreams]] linkao3(3082463). After Lily's death, Snape takes some kind of drugs so he can hallucinate about her. However, Dumbledore forces him to quit and now Snape has to learn to say goodbye. Breathtaking and incredibly moving, but not over the top.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1572146][Welcoming the Darkness]] linkao3(1572146). Snape wakes up in his coffin. Short, but painful and horrific.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5786821][Dim Sympathies]] linkao3(5786821). After Snape's death, his portait is painted, but very, /very/ much against his will. A fascinating and sad fic that raises some interesting question about free will and self determination in death. Told from the POV of portrait!Snape.

*Snarry, but not romantic*

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13439][In Between Days]] linkao3(13439). Harry is severely depressed, Snape kidnaps him from the Dursley's and proceeds to train him to defeat Voldemort, or does he? This is a classic in Snarry fandom and for good reason, since it's incredibly intense. Snape is manipulative, amoral and fucked up. Harry is drugged and suffers from a severe case of Stockholm syndrome. The relationship is dysfunctional and disturbing: Snarry at its worst (and therefore, for some of us, best). I was out of sorts for days after reading this and still consider its bittersweet ending one of the most powerful I've ever encountered in fanfic.

[[https://dracofiend.livejournal.com/17821.html][But It's Better If You Do]] and it's sequel [[https://dracofiend.livejournal.com/18882.html][It's Best If You Don't]] (Both fics are only available on LJ). After the war, Harry is tired of it all and flees, only to end up working at a sex club. All his friends search for him, but it's Snape who finds him first. And Snape doesn't care in the least. These fics are intense, dark and very twisted, yet the writing itself is wonderful! If you enjoy dark/ angsty Snarry, this story won't fail in gving you a perverse sense of delight.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/219888][Contrapasso]] linkao3(219888). Snape is a miniature prisoner in a miniature prison, with an angry, normal sized Harry as the jailor. Harry is dark and fucked up in this and does some pretty nasty things to Snape. Not just a torture!fic, however,

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/70876][Dangling Conversation]] linkao3(70876). After Dumbledore's murder, Harry sets out to Spinner's End to kill Snape. Emotional and intense, but the writing is atmospheric and beautiful.

​

I could give you loads more recs, but I'll leave it at this for now. I hope some of the fics I mentioned piqued your interest! If not, you could also browse the collection of fics written for HP Horrorfest, found [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/hpdarkarts_mod/collections][here]]. I don't know enough about that fest to be able to tell you which stories are good, but I do know there's some Dramione in there. Enjoy!

  The Malfoy family is not pleased with the announcement of a Marriage Law, but they are determined to get the best out of it, of course. And the best is clearly Hermione Granger. Hermione, however, would rather die. (Overall Winner of the 'Something Worth Fighting For' competition and also winner of Best Angst, Best Dark, Judges' Favorite, and Fan Favorite.) S&R:CRW
