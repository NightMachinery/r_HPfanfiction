** I think by labeling characters as 'grey' is still part of the problem. What's a grey character? Someone who is neither good or bad? Isn't that everyone? I sometimes do good and bad things, it's part of being human. The problem is that you have the good guys(light) and bad guys (dark) and the good guys who do bad things (grey) and this is what kills a good story. You for example can make a death eater the biggest mudblood hater, who feasts on maskilling, and is still be a good father/husband. Just like some nazi officers, who killed jews and then went home and lived as normal people. The same thing for a good guy who could murder and torture to protect his friends.

Tldr characters shouldn't be just light and dark, good or bad, but people who make mistakes, hurt others by accident, believe in their beliefs, whatever they are and can change opinion.

** I would also add that a "good" character /can/ have flaws.

It's not because you Indi Harry decided that Dumbledore may not be always right that he has to disrespect every figures of authority, or even every adults around. And while we are at it, a kid (or teenager at best) who goes on long monologue to explay to Snape why he is a bully and a terrible teacher in front of an audience is not cool, it's more like cringy. In this situation, a normal reaction of the audience would either be to look away because it's just embarassing to watch, or just unable to look away in the same way someone may be unable to look away from a car accident, just waiting to see how Snape would murder Harry.

Same thing with Hermione. She is a character with a lot of qualities (she is intelligent, brillant even, and brave), but you don't have to make her perfect. She doesn't have to be so beautiful a Veeloa seem plain in comparaison. She doesn't have to be the 2nd coming of Merlin able to match Dumbledor or Voldemort at 15. She doesn't have to be able to finish the scenario in 2 days because "Wizards lack logic, do as I say and we will win in 2 days).

​

Basically, a character without any nuance is either a fun parody, or completely boring.

*** Yeah I've put down so many fictions in fandoms when something like the long monologue explaining how someone is bad using high level language that someone of their age shouldn't be using, no matter how intelligent they are (obviously unless they're some wacky savant, but that's like some edge case). I agree with the fun parody or completely boring. I think it's when the writer doesn't realise how shitty it is to read an overpowered character, and doesn't have some sort of joke going with it I might as well be trying to read "character is epic and cool" over and over again.

** To go all Shakespearean on you:

*/What does it mean for our beliefs if there is no good or evil - that there isn't a manichaean dichotomy of right and wrong? It would mean that there is always doubt, and limitations, and regret in every choice. That perhaps there is no correct answer to every question, no simple solution to every problem./*

*/And such a thing is terrifying; it is a burden that few can bear the weight of, quickly passing it off to another./*

Diatribe over, now more direct. Simple characters are just generally easier to write as well. Why do you think Voldemort was written the way he was initially by Rowling, herself a generally talented author? In real life, the few people who we would say are "good" or "evil" in the style of a fairy tale are generally stomped out by society, one way or another. But thats harder to write isn't it? That for every seemingly good or bad choice, there is nuance and reasoning and motivations that don't come down to purity or malevolence. And most don't want to take the time to explain/write that out.

Hence Dumbledore deliberately intending Harry to be abused and neglected and ignorant, instead of trying to make the best decisions he can from the available evidence and letting everyone make their own choices (remember, its the personal choice that matters). Hence Snape deliberately trying to maim or kill or even massacre others out of personal pleasure, instead of being a bitter, disappointed man at war with his nature (read: child-abuse victim with an anti-social personality) and his love/obsession and greatest failure.

*** And indeed he is. And Hermione is bossy, Harry foolish and egotistical, Dumbledore naive and arrogant etc. etc.

The trick is, this doesn't define their character. They have flaws but they also have other characteristics. They are human. Everyone has flaws. But no one is made out of flaws. No even villains. This is what truly makes good villains, that truly makes them terrifying: The fact that there is a good reason behind what they are doing, the fact that they are relatable.

Hitler himself wanted to make Germany great. He wanted to take revenge for the extreme humiliation they faced. It was the way he went on doing that, that made him a villain. Maybe, if his life went a bit different, he would've gone to become one of the greatest artists of the world, awing everyone with the pure emotion he put into his work. But he didn't. He chose to channel his rage and humiliation into violence and murder. He became a deluded megalomaniac, believing that Jews somehow caused Germany's defeat and that some races were superior than others.

I don't like all people I meet IRL, but that just means I don't bother to spend more time than I need with them, not that I avoid them at all costs. Likewise I don't choose to read fics with Ron as a main character but I don't need him to be bashed to enjoy a story with him in.

** My thoughts on dumbledore and snape

Dumbledore: he means well. He really does. But he makes a shit ton of mistakes in his old age, and doesn't set them right fast enough. He also has way too many responsibilities, and does way more than a headmaster should (it really wasn't his decision where Harry grew up)

Snape: he is a bad person. Death eaters almost assuredly had to do TERRIBLE things, and he joined them willingly. He also was horrid to Harry because he looks like his fucking father and his mother died to save him. That said, he is on the side of the good guys DURING THE BOOKS. Prior to finding out Lilly would be killed, however, he was a death eater. He's a bad GUY but he's a GOOD GUY if that makes sense.

*** Snape is a man haunted by his actions. Not as a Death Eater, but as a man who screwed over the woman he loved. And it was more of a caustic love than a pure one.

That's another thing. Dumbledore likes to suggest that love is the purest good ever, but it's not. Love can be just as caustic and destructive as hate and rage. Vice versa, heat and rage can actually be constructive in a way.

**** I don't think Dumbledore said love was always pure, just that it can produce things beyond what magic can normally attain. In fact, part of learning about Riddle and how he came to be as he was, was exactly that his mother's love was a deep, unyielding obsession. Or later that Snape "loved" Lily so much he begged Riddle to spare Lily but the rest were nothing.

*** I'm honestly curious how much blood is on Snape's hands outside of canon events. What exactly does it take to become a Death Eater? Is murder/torture a prerequisite? Did Snape actively go on raids before he switched sides, or even after to maintain his cover?

Absolutely I agree that he should be allowed nowhere near a school/children, though. Kakaroff is worse IMO - he didn't decide to turn, he basically took a plea deal and then left the country. Says a lot about Durmstrang's management that they hired him as a professor.

**** Reading between the lines torture and murder are almost certainly a regular part of the life of a death eater. They aren't all psychopaths on the level of bellatrix but I can't see there not being some sort of initiation to become a death eater especially during the first war involving either joining a raid or just straight up killing a muggleborn you are familiar with The thing is though this is a kids series and we can infer and hypothesize all we want but jk really didn't focus on the darker aspects of the world like just look at the epilogue Voldemort's dead lets all settle down and act as if everything is normal even if the normal allowed bigotry to flourish

** I LOVE gray characters and write them that way as much as I possibly can. I have two Harry Potter fics going on right now and have written Snape and Ron morally grey for both of them. Fucked up and looking for redemption while managing to fuck up again is my favorite flavor.

One of my Snapes: Lets feel for him because he did something horrible under the imperius curse BUT also be furious at him because he was warned this could happen from a minor prophecy and was in too deep of denial to avoid it.

Same story Ron: Recovering asshole womanizing alcoholic that is haunted by horrible dreams of Fred and Hermione's deaths.

Another Snape: Finds religion after the first war to remove the dark magic from his soul, has a child (as a ‘tribute' of his religion) and hides the daughter when Voldemort rises again. Has neglected being an active parent for the four years between GOF and when the story starts. And this is just a subplot...

Same story Ron: Discriminatory towards an entire group of people based on their faith, overly emotional because of it but genuinely believes that the religion is toxic based on common misconceptions he was taught from childhood. TL:DR is discriminatory, but actually believes he is morally right

** JKR's characters have one big thing in common: They are complex. Just about nobody is 100% good or evil, they all have good /and/ bad sides. Even Umbridge likes kittens.

This is a problem for American authors. American culture is binary, there are no nuances, everything is black-and-white. You're either straight or gay, there's no "bi" in America. You're not allowed to agree with anything the "other" political party says. There are no shades of gray in America so I have no idea how that book became popular. Perhaps that made it doubly titillating.

Add to that the unfortunate tendency for authors to overdo the cute little details from the books. How many times was "Merlin" used as an expletive/swear word? Yet some (many!) authors have even muggle-borns using "Merlin" as an expletive in (I feel like) every other sentence. How many times did the Sorting Hat use the expression "better be"? I have read a fic where that was the /only/ expression the hat used. And may I never see the expression "furry little problem" ever again.

Here's a tip: Don't use the following expression more than once: Barking laugh, CONSTANT VIGILANCE, clumsy, twinkling, greasy, JORDAN! Did anyone not get which characters or situations I referred to? If anyone has one well-known defining characteristic, try not to use it more than once. Or ever. Imagination, it's a thing. Try it.

*** While I agree with you on some points, I disagree vehemently with JKR making characters complex. If anything, it's the lact of character development what makes the HP world so bad in my eyes. The most complex characters are Dumbledore, Snape and perhaps Grindelward. Harry never become a real hero, he's just a boy who constantly gets lucky until his last moment. Remus, leaves Harry for himself until he's a teacher, then fuck off until the OoTP book. Ginny, the supposed love interest, is absent until the fifth book too, etc. This is just another case of an author who just made shit up as she went and retconned far too many things to make it a truly throughout enjoyable experience.
