When I first got into the fanfic scene, which wasn't really all that long ago, the idea of using fanfics to make money was about as close to anathema as you can get in this community. Those enterprising few who set up Patreons and solicited 'thank you' money from their readers were dragged over hot coals by a large portion of the fandom. I remember the common refrain back then: Well, they probably won't get in trouble, but if this becomes a common thing then it might reach a point where rights-holders decide to take action.

Well, I now feel like we're moving rapidly towards it being that common thing. I am aware of quite a few of the 'big' writers who have set up Patreons, and some have hundreds of supporters. We are talking about individual writers making hundreds or even thousands of dollars a month off the back of their fanfics.

Some try to be coy about it. 'Oh, you're not paying for the incredibly popular fanfic', they say, 'You're actually paying for access to my original works', while they insert a plug for their Patreon into every author's note with an occasional statement along the lines of 'making more money off Patreon would mean I could do more writing'.

While it has never been tested legally, I suspect it would stand up in court about as well as employers who pay their workers under the table while saying 'Oh, no, I'm not paying him for working. I'm just giving him money because he's such a nice guy, and he's having a hard time at the moment. He's also picking up some work on the factory floor because he really enjoys it. I'm definitely not paying him for it'. Which is to say, I wouldn't expect it to hold up at all.

Then you have authors who are actually making their fanfic part of their supporter benefits. Early access (it's only a draft though!), or even just straight up fanfiction shorts written solely for supporters.

Using fanfic as a platform of sorts to launch a writing career is all very well and good, and I applaud every single author who has managed to make that jump. I do not doubt that having a big fanfic following will stand you in good stead if you advertise your new book to them. I am just left feeling incredibly uneasy when I see authors hiding new fanfiction content behind paywalls, nudge-nudge-wink-winking their way into getting hundreds of people to pay for their 'free' fanfics, or in one new notable case, even crowd-sourcing free/cheap labour from readers in order to make the writer money.

Hell, I even understand the temptation. I don't actually think fanfic damages ongoing income for a fandom like Harry Potter. In many ways I suspect that fan /art/ probably impacts Rowling's bottom line more than fanfic. Fanfic, after all, never really replaces the original work, while fan art can easily replace licensed merchandise. Even if it did, are you really going to lose sleep over denying Rowling, who is now not exactly the most popular person in the world, a minute fraction of the proceeds of her work?

So what do you think, reddit? Am I just clinging to the idea of a bygone time? It certainly seems that there are literally thousands of people out there who are entirely fine with what is slowly becoming a new normal.


** Its getting more commercial and its a ticking time bomb at this point. My guess would be that its going to be a large corporate franchise with very protective rights holders is going to notice and win a very easy victory. I would be surprised if this ever sees the inside of a court just because the people who hold the rights to most the fandoms have more lawyer money than god.

However until this presumed day in the future where the bomb goes off theres not a lot we can do to stop it as a community. Obviously theres just not paying these people but those of us who won't do that already aren't. I'm also wary of trying to set off the bomb itself for worry of the collateral damage it might do to the fandom as whole.

*** I know that AO3 retains lawyers expressly for the purpose of defending the rights of fanfiction authors, but those won't be available to someone seeking to commercialise their works. In some ways never making it to a courtroom is a good thing, at least that way we never have a legal precedent established which might result in takedown of the primary hosting sites.

I don't think AO3 would necessarily be forced to shut down, but they might for example be forced to exercise so much control over the works posted on it that it simply becomes untenable as a charitable endeavour.

Given that AO3 has... quite a sum of fanfictions that deal with stuff like underage characters having (graphic) sex which are a massive issue in countries with strict pedophilia laws such as Germany, I'm not surprised that they have lawyers on a sizable retainer.

What I /am/ surprised about is that this isn't known in the community - and the big hosters don't at least warn their users.

For the interested:

- Germany also sees works of text/fictional art like paintings as child/youth porn
- child porn < 14 is up to five years of jail ([[https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/stgb/__184b.html][§184b StGB]])
- youth porn (>14, <18) is up to three years of jail ([[https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/stgb/__184c.html][§184c StGB]])

Which makes that tag completely useless since a scene of 17 year-olds is perfectly legal and would not even get a raised eyebrow here (our teacher didn't even blink when one of the state-mandated novels had an affair between a 16ish boy and a 30ish woman) while some of the other stuff...

That being said, the law specifies that anything illegal has to be "like reality", and I can't imagine any attorney arguing that case for most of fanfics.

For this very reason, it is actually against the AO3 terms of service to ask for money on the website, or even allude to it (for example "go to my Twitter where I have linked my Patreon"). Some writers have been banned from the website for it, and many more have been warned.

If they are, FFN and AO3 are fucked, if they aren't they should be fine with their current token efforts to prevent it. Arguably I would see FFN and AO3 to be in a better legal place than the others listed above as they don't recomend things the way other websites do.

AO3 would be in better place than FFN, I think, because there are no ads that I can see, thus no ravenue and no shared accountability as long as ToS has a line to the effect "by posting there you claim that your work does not have any of those illegal things in it, if you lie, you're on your own". FFN should be safe too, but not as safe.

** To be honest, the only instances I've come across of money being involved where, to me, great things. The first time I realised money could be made with fan fictions was during a US natural catastrophe and it was only as a fundraiser. The writer didn't keep the money and the fic was shared after like a month to the rest of the public.

The only time where I see money being mentioned is when, in the end notes of a chapter, I see a link to that one plateform where you give like 1$ to buy them a coffee. (And, to be honest, if I had money I'd give to these things when the stories are great).

The idea of Patreons being made for this type of content is... weird. Who would pay for fanfiction ? How can you ask to be paid when you're taking both from the original author but also from fanon lore and the prompts of someone else ?

I really hope it doesn't come to that practice becoming common. It's one of these free hobby that can connect so many people. It'd truly dénature the very concept of it.

Also, if I'm paying for written fiction, I also except it to be at the same level of quality as published work. So I fail to see how it would even be sustainable.

No, it's an incredibly stupid thing to do by those authors and if and when a legal firm hits them with a cease and desist they'll be hit pretty hard and hurt badly.

If it actually becomes so common that it is somewhat ubiquitous I have to wonder whether sites like ff.net and ao3 can also be liable, because they knowingly allow commercial exploitation of intellectual properties they hold no rights to. They'd be smart to put a stop to this by deleting / banning everyone who does this.

*** From what I understand AO3 has a strict policy that authors cannot solicit money in anyway on their site or in fics posted to their site. If an author links a patreon account or mentions the words "donations accepted" in a fic and someone reports it, then AO3 will immediately take the fic down. AO3 only works if money doesn't exchange hands in anyway. However, I do know authors get around this by linking to discord or tumblr and then asking for money.

From the website..

" What exactly is fair use?

Fair use is the right to make some use of copyrighted material without getting permission or paying. It is a basic limit on copyright law that protects free expression. “Fair use” is an American phrase, although all copyright laws have some limits that keep copyright from being private censorship.

Fair use favors uses that (1) are noncommercial and not sold for a profit; (2) are transformative, adding new meaning and messages to the original; (3) are limited, not copying the entirety of the original; and (4) do not substitute for the original work. None of these factors is absolutely necessary for fair use, but they all help, and we believe that fanworks like those in the archive easily qualify as fair uses based on all these factors."

Source: [[https://copyright.columbia.edu/basics/fair-use.html]]

#+begin_quote
  Factor 1: The Purpose and Character of the Use

  The fair use statute itself indicates that nonprofit educational purposes are generally favored over commercial uses. In addition, the statute explicitly lists several purposes especially appropriate for fair use, such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research. These activities are also common and important at the university. But be careful: Not all nonprofit educational uses are “fair.” A finding of fair use depends on an application of all four factors, not merely the purpose. However, limiting your purpose to some of these activities will be an important part of claiming fair use.
#+end_quote

If a court determines that the purpose and character of the use is at least in part commercial, they might find that this factor is not in favour of a fair use. It will certainly look bad for an author if they make most of their monthly income through writing fanfiction. The fact that it's also freely available is irrelevant.

But I don't want to hide the following paragraph, which speaks to the transformative nature of the use, which is pretty strong in Fanfiction.

*** This is a bit of a tangent, but many hobbies based off of other intellectual properties are becoming monetized recently. Many people like to create modifications for different video games (called "mods") that other users can download to change how the game functions. Back in the day, it was absolute heresy for people to charge money for those. But now many modders are hiding their mods behind paywalls, or requiring you to follow ad links to scam sites in order to download their mods. Some communities have reacted extremely negatively (the Skyrim community tends to roast any modder who puts their mods behind a definite pay wall) but other communities, such as the Sims, don't seem to have as much of a problem with people charging for their mods. It makes me nervous about the future of modding for several reasons. I'm afraid there will be a legal crackdown, and I'm also noticing that modders are much less likely to share assets with each other.

I think this is similar to fanfiction. If people are making money off of a certain idea (which, let's be real, has probably been done before) are they going to get into a fight with someone else who starts making money off of a similar idea? How long is it going to take before this becomes a problem and we get a severe legal crackdown?

**** i think it will depend on the community in regards to mods like with the sims it's a lot of work to make a really good mod that doesn't glitch and works well with ALL the other mods being released and put out. Plus the constant updating for the sims 4 constant new packs that come out so for the sims community (as a simmer) i have no problem paying modders because we would not have a playable game (base sims 4 is trash idc idc idc) if it weren't for them. Not only that the Sims dev team reach out to and even work with modders and content creators so it's a completely different set up over there. That being said I think they'll come for fanart commissions first (with how big that...situation is) before they come for fanfic

​

Edit: also to add on, suing over fanfiction would put an author and even a company in Anne Rice territory and i don't think that that's something they're interested in, in fact based on the history of fanfiction and lawsuits it falls under fair use as a parody. (there's a "fanfiction" version of gone with the wind told from the perspective of the slaves and the estate of the original author tried to sue but lost because it fell under fair use. So the "fanfiction" is still available for purchase") It seems that as long as you're not doing something like making money off of an unofficial harry potter guide book then asking fans to donate money for the time you've spent on fanfiction isn't bad as long as it's not on AO3 because that's a completely different situation altogether.

If you have a Patreon/Kofi/commission page, what you have to do is put those links on some other page, like a tumblr blog, and then link that blog in the A/N.

That is why they always attack the hosting sites for hosting the content with as many legal reasons as possible. They will only go after prolific individuals who are easily found and in a sympathetic courts.

Just look at what they did to mega upload, that one WoW private server and fan made star trek movie. They got sued because they got too big, generated a lot of awareness or accounted for a lot of money.

Early 2000s the music/movie/tv companies united and fuc*ed a bunch of big named pirate software/websites such as LimeWire, and Napster.

The only reason FF has been able to get by for so long is that is has been done for non commercial purposes, thus does not explicitly infringe on the rights of the IP holders (it's in a weird grey area). Plus, it's considered a bad look now to send C&D ala Anne Rice to fan writers who are writing fanfics for no profit.

However, I think if a case involving this ever gets as far as a lawsuit, it'll likely be settled out of court rather than go to trial. No author wants to be labeled as a the creator that kills fanfics - especially since fanfics are part of the reason why fandom culture has become such an important marketing target to hit. It's extended the life of a show/movie/book past the original lifespan of the product.

But in terms of if AO3 and FF.net will ever be held liable, I don't think so. They're probably be considered similar to like how YouTube & copyrighted claimed videos, where it's the claim would be against the writer and not the hosting site. Plus, AO3 and FF.net are pretty strict on cracking down on stories/writers that attempt to commercial their fanfic.

I suspect that if a writing firm with big pockets/high paid lawyers wanted to, they could probably win. The legal aspect is what I would find most worrying. But I don't know - it strikes me as less of a direct monetization than, say, those who take commissions (especially common for art, obviously).

From a moral perspective, I think it's perfectly fine. It's available freely for anyone to read, and donations keeping the author able to do more fanfiction is fine by me in the world we live in. We don't mind giving some tips to someone playing guitar on the street, regardless of the music being played, for instance.

With stuff like this, as long as everything is freely accessible (be that fanfiction, mods, art, etc), then having a patreon/donations for people who want to help support you is fine morally... it's only a question of how it'll be legally that's worrying.

Sites like Etsy or Redbubble basically play a 'see no evil, hear no evil' game, and as soon as lawyers turn up they remove whatever stuff the lawyers point at, and leave everything else up.

Some rights holders are cool with it so long as it doesn't get too big. Some are completely not okay with it, but as enforcement of their copyright is largely down to them and their lawyers, it has resulted in a very messy fan landscape.

Copyright needs some kind of update for the modern era, but until that happens those fan artists are certainly not in the clear. If the rights holders wanted to go after them, they'd have very little chance of winning a legal battle.

*** I honestly in my heart believe that part of the difference in the way fandom values/allows for paid fanart and not for written fanfic is that art isn't really a standardized part of a school curriculum in most places. If someone learns to draw, and learns to draw /well/, by and large they do so on their own time. Writing, on the other hand, is a standard skill taught in school at every level (though the efficacy and end results vary wildly all over the place).

** You're absolutely true that it's a growing thing, and it's very problematic on a legal level.

But my major issue with it is that most fan fiction simply isn't worth paying for, even the most popular stuff. When you buy a professionally published novel you're paying for the multiple rounds of editing and rewriting that it's gone through before publication that make it a quality piece of work.

In contrast most fanfics are lucky to get a single round of editing or rewriting, and never with a professional editor.

But as this idea of earning from patreon becomes more prevalent, more and more authors think their work is of a standard that is worth being paid for. And inevitably this will lead to a point in the not too distant future where someone sets up a fanfic specific subscription service, and authors will move the entirely except for "tasters" published on AO3 or FFN.

And the biggest issue with this is that it will stop people from trying to actually improve their writing. Once you're being paid for it, the motivation to get better is diminished. And that'll screw a lot of authors who have dreams to progressing to becoming professionally published authors.

** As someone who got into a small argument a few days ago on this very subject, I can only agree.

Though in my mind the problem is less of a legal one and more of a mentality one, if you believe that doing /fan/fiction, whatever the quality, allows or even entitles you to seek remuneration, as far as I am concerned, you are a leech.

I say a leech because, like a leech, these people just profit off from others work, all the while saying that they are wrong, for what is fanfiction, if not someone saying that the original creator's work was inadequate ?

But of course there will come a day when a creator, won't be detered by the amount of rabid so-called-fans they will set off and seek to purge paid fanfiction, which will be, as far as I can tell, a great thing as it will eliminate a quite large chunk lf the mentality, if only by scaring away the ones who subscribe to it.

*** I disagree that such a person is a 'leech' and that writing fanfiction is saying the original work is inadequate. Across history works have been re-written, altered, elaborated by people who weren't the original artist and they have made money off this. Romeo and Juliet is a famous example, being originally written by Matteo Bandello. Today, with copyright law, there's just a line (drawn a more than a bit too far back), where on one side it's a 'retelling' or 'alternate interpretation' and you can make money off of it, and the other is 'fanfiction' and you can't.

I've never wrote or read fanfiction for a story that I felt was inadequate, and it would be unfair to call a work inadequate for not containing all the possible interpretations of its plot, characters and setting. I haven't profited off my meagre work either, and I think AO3 is an amazing resource and we should stick to its TOS. But I wouldn't really blame someone who did, as long as they aren't pretending they came up with the parts of the original story that they're using or putting the community in danger by being too blatant.

** Only adding to this thread to give personal experience with donations: I have donated to two authors' KOFIs in the past. They're not HP FF writers and they don't (imo) solicit donations in the way you describe. But I definitely gifted more than a $1 or 2 - so more in line with a one time patreon type donation.

Both instances were when I knew the author was having a hard time in their personal life, and I wanted to give a little support when I could afford it. They're big name fans in their respective fandoms and I'd consider myself to have a light friendship with them. So to me, supporting a writer really depends on my personal relationship with them, not their work. Would I ever do it again? Perhaps. Would I donate regularly to a Patreon? Not sure as no one I've ever liked has advertised having one - but I wouldn't say no, point being.

I understand the argument is morality and legality, but at the end of the day, there's never going to be a big time lawsuit preventing this so it's a moot argument. And if people don't want to buy into a paywall, there's always going to be writers who don't use them. If you'd told me 10+ years ago, I'd “pay” to read fanfiction I'd laugh my ass off. But I'm still laughing at the idea today, because it simply isn't common enough or restrictive enough so that I suddenly don't have access to free content any longer. I don't think it's worth speculating where the trend is leading, because we have no idea how the internet will change or what services will be developed. I don't think I could have dreamed up Patreon myself. I simply don't see this as being a big time problem, and I probably wouldn't read someone's work if I felt they were pushing for cash grabs. I wouldn't watch someone's YouTube content either though.

All in all, very interesting discussion and lots of great points from everyone :)

I believe it would be devastating to those involved, and their readers, but not to those who aren't. It may fracture the fandom for a bit but I don't think it would have any long term effects beyond simply setting a precedent that fanfics can't be monetized, and that's already considered common sense by most.

if a text-based ContentID simply removes stories which outright plagiarize entire passages from the original text, good riddance. And the only other system I can really imagine is a stricter system for preventing mentions of monetization, which shouldn't affect fandom health very much imo.

** I see why they would do it. They put hours of time into creating something people will enjoy, and they want to get as much out of it as they can. So I get where it comes from.

However, I don't believe it will make much of a difference so far as copyright goes, fair use comments on commercial use, but you don't necessarily have to make money off of it for the copyright to be infringed. So just avoiding money, doesn't completely free up the fandom to do what it wants.

That being said, I don't really approve of the practice. I'm all for Patreon and that stuff, on purely original works. It isn't a purely rational decision, just my personal preference. I'd rather the only fanfiction on Patreon be custom stuff for donors.

** I'm with you in the "fanfic shouldn't be commercialized" camp. It doesn't bother me when people sell fanart or crafts and stuff, but fanfic... that's a more slippery slope.

My actual legit university degree is in writing. I could easily churn out 1-2k (or more) for someone in a fairly wide variety of genres that wasn't fanfic. Maybe not the most /original/ writing (cliche and tropes are a thing), but I could do it. I haven't because, well, no one knows who I am.

The though has never crossed my mind to offer writing fanfic.

Also, plugging an original work (say a book that's getting published) to a fanfic audience is entirely different than having that audience pay money to read the fic or be a patron or whatever.

In the end, I'm with you. I'd never charge for someone to read fanfic I write, or for early access to the fic or anything. But hey, if someone wants me to write original short fiction, just for them and they're willing to pay me for it? I'd be down.

** It doesn't matter whether we think it's right or wrong. Literally makes no difference what we think. What matters is what the law, the authors, and the publishers think. Unless a few prolific fanfiction authors are actually millionaires or high-flying lawyers, the moment an author or publisher takes umbrage at the idea of fanfiction of their work, they have enough money and resources and legal support to ruin any fanfic writer that tries anything simply by dragging out legal proceedings and seeing who runs out of money/energy first. And if it happens often enough, or said fanfic writer is popular enough that Ao3 or FFNet goes to bat for them, it could have pretty wide-reaching consequences.

The only possibly plausible legal argument I've seen that fanfic could make under US law relies on transformative nature - if a piece of work using other people's IP is sufficiently transformative (ie. changes the original work in such a way that there's a strong distinction between the two - Harry Potter is a boy wizard in School, your transformative fic might make him an adult astronaut or whatever), the non-commercial aspects of fair use have less traction.

We exist only at the whims and mercies of authors and publishers and the bad press they'd get from harassing teenage girls who wrote a Snarry coffeeshop AU. Doing stuff with their work that they wouldn't like is just a shitstorm waiting to happen. I think most of fandom understands and acknowledges that, but there's definitely a growing proportion of people that are either desperate enough for money to take the risk, defiant enough of the wealthy/specific people like JK to want to 'take revenue', or just unaware/apathetic enough to go for it.

** I'm of the opinion of no, it isn't, and I'll explain my view.

I don't see how its too different from artists setting up patreons to fund the time/effort they put into their work. In fact, I'd say the only difference is because fanart is more mainstream and accessible (a "normie" fan probably hasn't read a fanfic, but will have seen fanart) it makes sense for artists to reach commercialisation earlier on, but that by no means should stop authors being able to do the same thing.

They are content creators, are they not? It shouldn't matter if the market is more niche, okay they may make less, but its still valid. It takes a lot of time, passion and effort to write a full forty-chapter story (more than fanart, but thats an argument I've learnt to stay away from). If the author is using patreon you aren't paying for the story or just 'handing them' money because you like them, you're paying for the time that they put into it. And they put a LOT of time into it. I will spend on average four-six hours a day, maybe four or five days a week writing? Its not a full-time job, but those definitely fit the hours of a part time job. And this is while holding down my full time job and social life. AND f you have the kind of following where it CAN function as a full time job, I believe you should be allowed that. There are hundreds of authors I'm sure with big enough followings who wish they could quit their day job and write full time the exact same way community-supported fan artists do.

I believe if you think people who draw fanart are valid recieving money, you should be fine with writers who write fanfiction recieving it too. Obviously not all, some writers can put more effort into their work than others I understand that. But if people paying money to support fanart is normalised, I believe paying money for supporting fanfictions should be as well. It may be a controversial opinion, I get that, if you disagree thats fine, but I don't believe FF has become more commercialised, I think authors being paid for their work is the correction of a long standing wrong.

I hope that all made sense. I'm a fanfiction writer, my partner is a fanartist. Its a topic we have spoken about a lot and she agrees with me... well, apart from the bit about fanfiction taking more effort than fanart, but thats my hill to die on ;)

*** I saw you got some down votes for this but I don't think that's fair. You've certainly expressed one of the most oft heard arguments for fan work monetization.

Unfortunately, fan art also falls foul of the kind of intellectual property laws that always hang over fanfiction. I have created both fanfiction and fan art and in order to remain consistent I have always supplied both entirely for free to those who asked.

Platforms like Etsy do sell fan art and this might give it the illusion of acceptability but even Etsy is aware that such works are a potential violation of the copyright holder's rights and remove any items at the request of the rights holder.

I think the question 'is it okay to make money from fan works?' Gets interpreted in two different ways.

The first is that people interpret is to mean 'is it /morally/ okay to make money from fan works?' this question is fairly debatable and the answer likely depends on which side of the argument you're on. Rights holders would probably argue that it is /not okay/ that they get nothing from such derivative works while fan creators would argue that it's good that they get reimbursed for their time, effort and expertise.

The other interpretation is that the question means 'is it /legal/ to make money from fan works without the permission of the rights holder?' and sadly I think the answer to this under current law in most countries is 'no'.

Intellectual property rights are a massive mess and it's really only the messy broken up nature of fandom on the Internet that has kept it all from exploding into a thousand lawsuits. It's held together by rights holders being generally quite forgiving of improper use of their property, and fan creators trying to stay beneath the notice of those rights holders.

Something will have to give. I just hope that fan creators taking advantage of the latitude that has been granted to us by rights holders doesn't result in a heavy hammer coming down like how YouTube has to try and police all of the stuff uploaded to them. If that happens, I suspect the era of open, publicly available, centralised fanfiction may come to an end.

**** A good point drawing the comparison between legality and morally, I definitely understand what you mean and I don't think that much had occurred to me before.

Personally I'm a hard yes on the question of it being moral. I've got a few feature-length stories under my belt so I know the amount of blood, sweat and tears that go into writing and often the payoff is nearly never worth it. If you can't get into the mindset of "I'm writing this for myself, if others enjoy it too, great" then FF is extremely difficult to keep to (Review your fics, people reading this!). That being said, I also know when I've put in enough work to warrant being paid.

So I reiterate, you're not paying for the fanfictions, you're paying to support the author. If a writer is able to make the same amount from patreon support as they would do their full-time job, suddenly they have a lot more free time in which to do fanfictions, THATS what the payment is there for. As a veteran of it, I firmly believe fanfiction should be treated no differently to the likes of fanart, cosplay, YouTube editorials or Lets Plays. And most of which, people are already fine with paying money for, even though it involves people using properties that are not their own. Because they paying the creator for their time and effort, not the content on a buy it or get nothing' construct.

And as far as legality goes? Well, you just have to look again look at YouTube and the struggle online creators have with trying to talk about/use content that isn't their own. Yet, we don't believe for a second that they don't deserve every bit of money they receive through patreon. But under the same rules that a lot of others are arguing, funding cosplayers, fan musicians, fan animators, fandom YT channels and fanartists must also be wrong. But that argument won't be made, because with them, people understand they're funding the continuation of their hobby and keep making content, not paying FOR the actual content. Fanfiction is a lot more looked down on as a hobby than any of those, one can't help but wonder if there were more positive attitudes about it, that may be different.

Its complicated sure, but it becomes less so when you realise at no point are you PAYING for the content, but rather paying THEM for their time/effort put into making it. There is /technically/ a difference, and that difference is what matters. Either everything should be fine, which includes fanart, cosplay and fanfictions, or none of is (which I recognise some will argue for, but thats not my point, I'M arguing fanfiction should fill the same category regardless.)

That being said, I absolutely do not support putting chapters behind paywalls or anything of the sort. Selling hardcopies of your book at a con? Big no no. Fundamentally, profit should not be the goal, but a tool for continuing your work.

I think now reflecting on it, I've accidentally ended up answering "Should fanfic writers be paid for their time?" instead of the actual question posed, sorry about that. Which I firmly believe yes, they should, but because fanfictions are looked down on as the bastard child of fan content, they are not. ALSO it is worth being said I'm a self-employed actor, so thats probably severely affected my opinion on it, I've learned the hard way that if you want your business to be taken seriously then you HAVE to stand up for yourself, defend your rights, argue for pay, etc.

Hope I made a good case for my argument!

***** But when one writes fanfiction some of the work of writing a story has been done for you. In fact Id argue the hardest part of writing (making characters people care about) has been done for you and the work you subsequently put in is only possible because of the original creator. How can you be compensated and the OG author not? Sure you probaly paid them for their story but buying something to use for yourself is not the same as buying something with the intent to change it and resell it. The main reason people make money off of fan art is porn. People are paid to draw lewd pictures of characters they cant get anywhere else. I also think this is unethical. Especially so if the creator is against that depiction of them.

Although, if the writer has specifically asked fans not to do fanfictions of their work, that kind of becomes a different matter all together. Its really a case by case scenario, you can't automatically cross out all fanfics for everything just because a few creators may not like the fact it exists.

YouTube content creators are always suing each other for using content from different creators videos. You also have the actual companies who solely exist to buy content from random people for small fees so they can charge YouTubers much more and they also shut channels down who uses their content without paying for it.

I personally think this is a ticking time bomb waiting to attract people wishing to profit from ending our major fanfic hosting sites so they can spin off a legal site with permission to use the content. Because it's better for the original authors and publishing houses to earn free money from subscription service for fanfic legal site and have control over what type of content the site will allow. All they have to do is license it out to someone who will make it work within the set guidelines given.

In the end it matters not what we as a fanfic community think is right or wrong but what the owners of said intellectual properties believe to be right.

******* I dont think its ethical to make money off of someone elses work regardless of the format. If the youtube channel is making money off of nothing but lore videos of a series I dont think thats ok either. I dont think youtubers that dont create original content should be monetized.

Do you think most authors are ok with people making money off their stories? Most authors dont care if fans write fan fiction they just dont want people to monetize it. Atleast thats the vibe I get reading interviews and what not.

Lol ofc it exists that doesnt make it ethical. The original creators worked even harder for it and youre stealing from them. Why is it ok for you to make money off of someone elses work? They shouldnt do it because its unethical. Im not gonna force em to stop but acting like just because effort was put into it doesnt make it belong to you. If you want to write stories and make money do it without using other peoples stories.

Anyway, I understand where you're coming from, to an extent. I was a pretty involved in a modding community for a long time and made a couple of my own as well as acted as someone to that understood the game's mechanics to the point that people would come to me for help.

I must've invested hundreds, if not thousands, of hours into modding and understanding the game as a whole and yet I can't imagine asking for money simply because I was modding someone else's game. I did it for me, and there was quite literally no other reason to do it other than I thought it was fun. Would it have been cool to be paid? Probably, but it would have felt wrong to even allow donations on my part.

Even worse, some fic writers release things for patrons only and that /is/ monetizing something you have no right to. In the end, it depends on your reasons for doing things and what you believe in, but I think that if someone owns the rights to something in which someone else is dabbling in (s)he shouldn't allow any chance for any donations relating to the copyright shenanigans.

Oh, in regards to the fanart argument and so many other things of that nature(un-monetized fan creations) are called passion projects for a reason.

** I see the same trend, Steelbadger, and I'm very much not fine with it. 15 years ago, /any/ kind of compensation was an anathema. It should have stayed that way. For me, there is a clear line: When I write FF, regardless of how many hours I sink into research and writing, that's a hobby. I pay for it, I don't /get/ paid for it. In any way. If I want to make money, I need to write original stuff.

End of story.

The status quo exists because so far, no one cared to do anything about it. And obviously, the first choice is not to sue the writers. First in line is Patreon. If they ever end up in the cross-hairs of some IP holder, I'm quite interested to see what happens next.

** Well the way I see it, people start fanfiction as a hobby, or as a way to get better at writing. If they get really good and enjoy it, they will have people asking for more, and they would be delighted to comply - but writing takes time and effort normally taken up by a day job.

Thus, there is a choice: /"Do I drop my fanfiction for a time, try to write an original novel in hopes of it being succesful enough to offset the living expenses? Or do I reach out to the audience I've accumulated, who enjoy my work and are numerous enough that even a $1 pledge would more than cover me writing exclusively?"/

*I, myself, prefer authors for who choose the crowdfunding option.* After all, the reason I've become their reader is their fanfiction. It's something I'm guaranteed to enjoy, unlike an original novel they might need a lot of time, effort and trial and error to write.

It might cover topics i wanted the original to cover, character interactions otherwise unthinkable or my OTP.

This is *not something the Big Honcho of the Fandom is able or willing to provide* - too much variation, too much work, too little motivation. Asking J.K.Rowling for a "Harry Potter book, but the epilogue makes sense" is not only laughable, it might be insulting. So fanworks fill the niche.

Comissions, KOFI, Patreon - they don't necessarily make the product, but they certainly up the production speed. It keeps the community alive and keeps people buying the originals long after they get knocked down from bestselling rankings.

Now, anyone trying to steal/claim content or holding their work hostage doesn't get covered by the above. But people who only ask for support to be able to dedicate more of their time to writing? There are plenty of worse ways to spend money - and plenty of crowdfunding campaigns ranging from genius to Dawin smiled - so why not support a non-mainstream artist from time to time?

** The more I hear, the more I think it might be a good idea to migrate from fanfiction.net to AO3. Especially with what I see a few comments in this thread saying about it. But it's UI just looks so alien compared to ff.net's, though imo. Which is why I'm so hesitant to do so.

I don't have a lot of stories that I followed and favorited, that's... slowly starting to change, though. But what I really do worry about is my own story. Of which is an everyday struggle to get off the ground due to my apparent lack of motivation lately. The latest chapter, took me almost a year to get it out! And these people that commercialize their fanfics make me nervous. Because I start wondering if the IP owners are gonna bring the hammer down on all of us.

Yes, it's technically promoting the original work, yes fanfic is parody, yes, parody is fair use. Yes, most are okay with it if asked. But it's those that don't that make me worry. Just because you can doesn't mean you should, as they say.

** To be honest, I don't mind if an author wants to make some little money for their effort, and as a benefit, you can read 1-2 chapters ahead. That's okay, I guess.

But I have seen authors that block 25+ or so chapters behind a Patreon paywall. That's not okay at all.

One author of a story I used to like even had 125 chapters behind a paywall. One day, probably because he wrote something shit, he lost a lot of Patreons and went down from 83 to 63 or so, and then he stopped uploading chapters for free entirely for some time.\\
As a response, the author lost a lot of readers and got some negative reviews. He started uploading chapters for free again, but they were really short (like 1000 words), and half of it were the author's notes - advertising the Patreon page, of course.\\
That guy turned into a really greedy goblin, and eventually lost his fanbase, and also his motivation to write since he seemed to have started to write only for money.

Well, anyway... I think that someone will eventually face a nasty lawsuit.

If I were an author, and I would catch some shmock making money with my story (like a few thousands), defiling my work by writing some cheap harem crack-fiction, I would for sure sue that individual to hell and back.

Fanfiction is now the default for the film industry, as most movies made today are simply a form of fanfiction. Original stories are simply not getting made as much.

Youtubers used to post content for the love of the topic and if they got a big following, great. Now the specific purpose of creating content is to monetize your channel through views, t shirts and other merch. Many of them even have their own patreons on top of the youtube revenue they are drawing.

Even celebrity itself has been monetized moreso. I'm old enough to remember that has-been celebrities going to conventions and signing autographs was viewed as the sad end of the actors' career. Now, celebs are monetizing themselves through conventions and things like Cameo.

Even though its totally illegal, one could argue that a fanficton writer making money off their work is more pure than what most are doing now.

*** A very good question that exposes a very muddled part of copyright ownership.

Essentially, copyright violation (or, rather, whether the work is Fair Use or not) is based on some rules which are very open to interpretation.

Lets consider music, for example. Over the last few years there have been a number of cases where music rights holders have sued others for use of their property to promote something with which the rights holders do not agree. The people being sued did not make money off the songs, they were just being played at events as backing tracks, but they used the music to promote themselves, which was regarded as a violation of fair use.

Basically, as copyright law currently stands, even using a fanfic to send people towards your own original works (which you then benefit from) is potentially a thorny area if the rights holder decides to take exception to it.

It's pretty broken and ridiculous, but that's how the law stands at the moment. The end result of it is simply that the greater conceptual distance you can put between your benefit, and your unlicensed derivative works, the better.

** I personally love that more authors have Patreon or Kofi. I don't have a problem with writers being financially supported for their work. I have read some truly incredible fan works and am grateful when I can contribute something to such people. Some will say they should write their own original fiction, but I'd very possibly never have read their work if it was original fiction. And part of what makes their work so meaningful is how they reinterpret and expand on the HP universe.

I can see how a new writer struggling to get started could find this difficult if their characters or plot were then used by others, but I'm not worried about it for Rowling. Maybe in addition to have copyright expire after a certain number of years, it should also expire after the holder makes their first billion or so off the work (or less). At that point it passes into a cultural phenomenon that everyone owns (or "owns").

I think at this point that HP has reached cultural mythology status. The characters are right up there with Star Wars in terms of mythological status. Almost like deities or demigods in a pantheon in polytheistic cultures. I think about the Norse pantheon and its variations, and how there's different deities who feature in different stories, and from different regions you'd get variations on those stories. Someday, if our civilization collapses but some people survive, people might tell stories of Harry and the rest around campfires, from memory both of canon and the many fan works out there. All the different variations might confuse an alien species that comes and tries to understand humans, wondering why our mythology isn't consistent. But that's how mythologies evolve. My thinking on this is influenced by Claude Levi-Struass, the anthropologist.

Wait what o.o (No, seriously, I completely missed this and I'm beyond curious)

-------

That being said, legally it's all a toss-up. As a base: If someone pays you to write X story /for them/ that's debatable whether it infringes afaik. This means that commissions, as they are, might not be infringing (I'd love more info on this). But as I've read it, demanding payment from a group for access to something you'd write anyway is more of an issue than taking 15 bucks to write a specific request for someone.

/Generally/ speaking there's a couple of ways that make it more defensible that people are supporting 'the author' rather than a specific IP. A big thing here is writing in multiple fandoms. It's hard for X to rationalise that this patreon is costing them Y money if 30% of it is not related to X at all. Otoh, if content is permanently exclusive, then that's an issue because then you're (effectively) selling access. That is beyond the pale and would get you shut down pretty damn quickly the moment someone on the other side decides it's worth it to do that.

That being said, I see absolutely nothing wrong with 'limited access' times for new chapters etc. It's free content, if you don't want, or are unable, to pay the author then the chapters will come in due time. The author will still love you just as much for a comment on Ao3 or FF.net as they would on the Patreon. This also cycles back to the legal aspect, where it'll be easier to 'defend' it if there is no /true/ exclusive content on offer that belongs to the IP in question.

#+begin_quote
  Some try to be coy about it. 'Oh, you're not paying for the incredibly popular fanfic', they say, 'You're actually paying for access to my original works', while they insert a plug for their Patreon into every author's note with an occasional statement along the lines of 'making more money off Patreon would mean I could do more writing'.
#+end_quote

Oof. I feel this. But yeah, writing an original work /properly/ is an incredible amount of effort compared to fanfiction and I don't say this lightly. I /know/ that writing fanfiction also is very much not easy to do. That being said, Patreon (for example) is a great way for a prospective author to get an idea of 'okay, so I have x amount of readers. Y of those think I write well enough that they'd like to support me' which can help determine if an original work is even worth it (also considering that doing an original work is very much not free).

But yeah, it's always a rough deal that's hard to make sense of, really.

-----

That being said, it's happening and we'll end up seeing where the hammer falls. I do expect something to hit in the coming years which will lead to harsher rules etc.

Until then, it's up to authors to respect the rules of their platform. e.g. Ao3 having clear rules against mentioning having a Patreon or doing a commission. Linking to a discord/tumblr/whatever where there is a note of that existing is okay though, which is interesting in its own way.

** Honestly, I've seen this going in for at least 20 years. Perhaps people just notice it more now because of the platform? Back in the day people would package their fics as zines and put illustrated covers on them and sell them. There was actually zine stores that hosted authors published works. Same thing for the ones who had audio versions of their stories. There was monetization there too.

Good Lord, let's not forget the ones amongst my fandom writer peers who published fan fiction as original works. At least of which was fairly popular.

** I ultimately see little reason for an author not to have a patreon or tip jar as long as it's not hidden behind said thing. It's a way for people to show their support, and as long as it's not behind a paywall it's fine in my eyes. The issue is primarily through crowdsourced fanfictions (which i'm not keen of) or pay-by-chapter ones, which I also despise.\\
Also, commercializing fanfictions has been tried.. and failed, ala Kindle Worlds. I highly doubt large efforts to truly monetize it will reach fruition.

** Hiding /fanfictions/ (building on someone else's work) behind paywall definitely feels like theft.

It's a horrifying idea that will backfire and I can only hope that we will preserve our "rights"(privilege) to write fanfictions.

** The sustained anger at this subreddit for writers making money off their writing is baffling. For every fanfic writer who has a patreon there's a dozen artists who have patreons that are focused on creating art based off commercial property and no one bats an eye.

If fanfiction gets killed due to a few idiots trying to make money out of the Harry Potter IP, then this sub kinda dies.

*** I feel 'anger' is maybe a bit of a mischaracterisation to be honest. 'Concern' seems far more apropos.

That said, fan artists who make money from their works stand beneath Damocles' sword, just the same as fanfiction authors. If a rights holder wants them gone, they have no legal recourse, they must simply remove their works. Sites like Etsy and Redbubble will immediately remove any item which has a complaint raised against it by rights holders. It is really only the good will of the rights holders that allows this practice to continue.

**** Sure, but it feels unnecessary to bring this up when it's been happening for a very long time. Lots of things could vanish overnight if the rights holders pursued legal action, but it doesn't occur. People are going to make money off their own work one way or another. If you published your work more regularly with the help of patreon, I would probably subscribe to it as would many others.

** As someone that hates the copyright laws of the world with a passion, I personally have no problems with this. Honestly, I actually feel like selling fanfics straight out should be allowed. Do I think this will lead to lawsuits? I have no idea. /Probably/ not, if only because no fanfic hidden behind a paywall will ever get big enough to be noticed like that. The internet is so freaking huge it's difficult to conceptualize. If someone wants to sell fictional work that they themselves wrote (nevermind the world or characters used) then it would be all but impossible to stop them... It just won't ever take off...

** For me personally, so long as you don't make it as if it's original content, maybe send a part of whatever you win through it to the author?

Paywalls in this kind of thing are horrible, but I am not against giving some money to someone writing a fanfic I enjoy. So long as they don't enforce it or sell their stuff.

** If they want to get paid for writing (being an author can be both a hobby and a job, depending on the person) and if there are people willing to give them money then why should I, or anyone else for the matter, care?

I certainly think it's stupid to pay money for fanfiction of all things when you can simply find one that is free, though.

Sure I may have physically put this new ipod together spent money on parts but like i didnt come up with the idea behind the ipod. Im just takinf someone elses thing refurbishing it and selling it like its mine. What about the people that spent time coming up with the idea for the ipod? Do I just get to steal from them because I want to?
