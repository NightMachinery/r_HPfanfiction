  If pressed, later, she'd say it was exhaustion that caused her to forget who she was talking to, and it was that same exhaustion which prevented her from foreseeing the inevitable fall-out of telling James Potter, “Ugh, no thanks, I hate flying.”

** I don't read a lot of jily main fics but I read quite a bit of wolfstar back in my early teens and my favourite was The Shoebox Project which is more of a Marauders fic than a ship-specific one! Will definitely be checking out Turning Tables

  Lily Evans' and James Potter's relationship has always been a complicated story; it's just about to get a lot more complicated. And so is everything else. They might not know each other well, but they're about to know each other a lot better. Cover art by anxiouspineapples.

  It's difficult to say when James and Lily took the first steps to love. Perhaps it was in April, 1977, shaken by tragedy. Perhaps it was all the way in September, 1971, when they met on a train. Perhaps they had always been walking this road, unaware of the person they were walking towards until the mist cleared. They would fall in love eventually --- but we would be remiss in ignoring the hiccups along the way.Updates Saturdays at midnight, eastern time.

  He had no claim to her, and he knew that. But James never expected to find Lily in a classroom with someone else. He also never expected to like it. But most of all, he never expected that she might come to like it too, and that it might bring them closer than before, like he had always wanted.

  A hasty decision and a bet they never should have agreed to result in James and Lily spending a lot more time together in October of their 7th year than they ever anticipated. A story of growing up, identity, and falling in love.

  The last thing Lily Evans expects the summer before her seventh year is the infamous Potter family moving in down the street. But in the gold light of summer, James and Lily find themselves unexpected friends-and then, unexpectedly, more than friends. (Cross-posted from Ao3 under efk girldetective)

#+begin_quote
  Sequel to Summer Girl 1977. Summer is over. Lily Evans and James Potter are in their seventh and final year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The world around the castle shifts, unmoored. Love and friendship become urgent, imperative concerns---become, perhaps, the difference between life and death.
