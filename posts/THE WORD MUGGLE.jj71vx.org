I honestly get tired of reading fics where the characters make such a big deal about the term "muggle". They go on and on about it being a racial slur that implies wizards are superior. This is a ridiculous notion that I've seen pop up in majority of the stories I've come across. I've even seen authors compare it to the "N" word.

If you want to compare something to the "N" word then it would be "Mudblood".


** Yeah, I've seen that and it's never really tracked to me. Obviously none of the made-up words are comparable to real life slurs, but Muggle never seemed to have derogatory connotations as far as I remember. It was just a regional term for a non-magic user. Obviously there are wizards who use the word and have negative views towards non-magical people, but that doesn't make the word itself offensive. In fact, Muggle-born is specifically the inoffensive way to refer to a magic user with Muggle parents. It's always seemed strange because like you mention, Mudblood is explicitly a slur in the HP universe, so it's not as though there isn't material to work with.

*** According to Rowling, 'Muggle' comes from 'mug', meaning fool, gullible, though it's also meant to be endearing. This is in contrast to 'wizard' which historically comes from 'wise'.

So it's not hateful, but it is condescending at the very least.

*** but using the r word in that context has always been ableist. They way they (medical professionals) thought of us was hardly generous. It was fucking awful and their treatments were tantamount to abuse. so when you use it as ‘it was totally fine to say it' it's not taking into account the bleak and violent history behind that word and those like it

The reason we flinch when we hear or read that word being thrown around isn't just because of the way people have used it toward us on the school yard. it's because of all the blood spilled in the past as well

so if we look at the term it is different because in the past it was the magical people being murdered, so I wouldn't say it's the same as the R word, and it's certainly not the same as the N word. It has its own complicated (if fictional) history

I do agree that if someone is going to talk about it being a slur though, they should think up a history about when/why the term came into use

** It's common for (nominally) isolated minority groups to have a word that basically translates add "everyone who isn't us." And it may imply inferiority - after all, they don't do things /our/ way, which is obviously better.

As for the argument that the word originated from the meaning of "foolish," I'll point out that it's how it's used currently that determines if it's depository or not. Just as an example, "hussy" came from the word for housewife. Try calling a housewife that and telling her she shouldn't be insulted... Then run.

** It's not a slur, because of how and when it's used. Wizards have little to none interactions with muggles, and even when they do they generally can't/shouldn't be using that terminology because of SoS reasons. If they were to live alongside non-magicals in an open society it would definitely be considered a slur by now, but if they don't - it's not.

I mean, i can give an example - n***r has a translation to my native tongue, but you could generally use it as a synonym to 'black' and unless the context of what you were talking about was racist noone would bat an eye, because we don't have that kind of history or demographics that would lead to the word becoming considered widely offensive.

Then it's not really a translation of 'n****r', but of 'black person' that phonetically sounds like 'n****r' - after all, translation should be done based on meaning, not phonetic closeness...

Also, in English 'n****r' has always been offensive; according to Myriam-Webster dictionary, it started out as a derogatory synonym for 'Negro', which is the historical word for black person (now also offensive, if to a lesser extent).

Hey, i'm the one who speaks both, not you, and phonetic closness is nowhere to be seen in either case anyway.

It's still a derogatory term when used against a black person, but it doesn't carry the insane weight it does in the US, so unless you call a bunch of black folk 'ni***s' you could still use it without someone ascribing racism to you.

Example: you could say that someone is treated, or works, 'like a n***r' (translated) and it would be a perfectly fine thing to say since the word doesn't carry the same taboo on it as it does in the US.

Because even Rowling admitted that the word implies foolishness. It British English "mug" is slang for a stupid person. So calling a whole group of people that is akin to calling them retard, especially since it separates people based on the ability to do something, magic in this case. That being said, there is no good alternative and the "American" term does not sound right in a British setting (too modern). The best option is to simply acknowledge that the term isn't really kosher.

I think the problem with how wizards talk about muggles isn't that word, it's everything else they're saying about people who aren't magical and how they treat them. Most wizards seem to be /incredibly/ ignorant about the outside world and have zero respect for the capabilities of muggles.

Even one the most-muggle friendly wizard we meet in the books Arthur Weasley, who's work exposes him to all kinds of muggle stuff, sees his interest in them as kind of a hobby. A hobby even /his own wife/ thinks he's fucking weird for having.

Having a sports festival with a hundred thousand attendees? We can totally keep all muggle eyes away from that, no problem. Just remember to continually blitz any nearby muggles with obliviation until we're gone.
