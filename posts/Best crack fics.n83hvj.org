Hi! No particular pairings, if there are maybe the canon ships. But what are some of the best crack fics you've read? I'm reading the seventh horcrux and it's pretty good so far.

But anyone know of some OOC fics? Not Harry Centric! Ty! :)

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

  Harry Potter has achieved immense power, a large bit of craziness, and a desire to seek amusement where he can. This will be a series of stories of him traversing the multiverse solving problems through ways that amuse him. Various crossovers planned.

** *Silly Silly Book Series* is basically just a literal, bashing of the books in a really dumb way. It's good fun to read because it just highlights all the stupid crap, I read it when I need a laugh.

*Luna and the DLs Diary* is Luna Lovegood gets the Diary in CoS and it's just very funny to watch Tom Riddle get pissed and then confused by Luna. It's sweet and silly. Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12407442/1/Luna-Lovegood-and-the-Dark-Lord-s-Diary]])

This is a Tomarry story (it's the only Tomarry story I've read because I don't like this pairing but it made me laugh enough to stick with it) but they keep getting reincarnated and basically just fuck shit up. It's good craic. Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11907443/1/Full-Circle]])

  Tom Riddle's plans fall through when Ginny Weasley loses his diary shortly after starting her first year and it is found by one Luna Lovegood. A series of bizarre conversations follow. Luna? - Yes Tom? - I've been giving this a lot of thought...and I believe you may be insane. (Not crack. Plot takes a while to appear but it's there) See last chapter for fan art and translations.

  What if the Horcrux hadn't quite been as contained by the Blood Wards as Dumbledore planned? Rather than influencing Harry's personality, it darkened his aura. An aura already rather grey, despite his innocent nature. Grey with the darkness of his parents traumatic deaths, grey with his status as the last living primary heir of the Peverells, thusly a child of Death -- and that made him something warm, endearing and adorable to the dark creatures of the magical world. Man, wouldn't that suck for any other wannabe dark lord trying to make a comeback!

** If you don't mind X-overs I LOVE "Itachi is that a baby". By far my favorite Crack fic of all time and any fandom. other than that I would recommend "It's always the quit ones" or something. it's not exactly humor... more of Existential Horror type of thing with you awkwardly smiling in the corner in order to cope. but it's so out there that I definitely consider it Crack.

P.S. I don't have the fics opened so just Google them.

No links due to Rule 8:

/The Crack'd Mirror/ on ffn. Voldemort attempts to summon AU versions of himself for aid. Due to a minor boo boo the first attempt replaces Harry with the Harry that was Emperor Gellert's protege/archenemy. It's also the only story I'm aware of where Millie joins a harem.

/Lucky Harry/ by Pyrgas on ffa. Harry's shattered arm heals with the cracks forming a runic array.

/All it Takes is One Girl/ on AO3. Harry accidentally marries Narcissa. Which triggers a bunch of stuff and really annoys the girl he was already engaged to.

  When a Magical game of Truth & Dare goes wrong, the Gryffindor Quidditch team must 'bare' up and face the consequences. And as the news spreads like wildfire in mmail things get quite out of control.
