  This starts somewhere in between chapter 37 and 38 of “Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix” by J. K. Rowling. Harry just learnt about the Prophecy and wrecked Professor Dumbledore's office, but wounded members of the Dumbledore Army are still in the hospital wing of Hogwarts. He thought that the mysterious prophecy is the last surprise of that summer. How wrong one can get? One of those stories of “the summer between the fifth and sixth year, Harry gets his issues together”, but hopefully less tropey and with a twist.Response to my own challenge at Reddit.This is very much Work in Progress, so you can expect changes even to the published chapters. Comments, review, objections and accusations are all welcome.
