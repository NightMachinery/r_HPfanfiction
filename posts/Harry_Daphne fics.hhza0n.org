****** Consult the book of armaments!!! - Chapter 7, Verse 25

And on the fourth day after the first task of the tri-wizard tournament Daphne Greengrass woke up as the sun shined into the Gryffindor 4th year boys dorm room. "I loved last night Harry, I will cherish it forever." she spoke to her green eyed warrior. "I'm so glad I picked you so many hears ago instead of all those fan girls who threw themselves at me. I can't wait until we are 15 so we can get married. I want to make little Potters with you." she sighed in complete bliss "I can't wait either darling." she then nuzzled back into his shoulder and fell asleep.

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.

** linkffn(Daphne Greengrass and the Importance of Intent) is probably second-best Haphne fic to Novocaine, but has the benefit of being complete. I personally don't think it's a great introduction to the ship though because it subverts so many of the tropes.

That said, I'd read Novocaine and a couple of James Spookie's fics to get a feel for how the cliche's of the ship are normally used - linkffn(the things we do for love; lion tamer; legacy preservation act) - and then Importance of Intent.

*** I think Beltane Child is one of the most disappointing stories I ever read.

It starts out really well. It's a totally original premise, even if it's a little bit contrived, but after a great opening it rapidly becomes a story about childcare, which... meh.

#+begin_quote
  AU. Two days after returning home from fifth-year classes and O.W.L. exams, Daphne Greengrass finds on her pillow, a letter from her much-older self. Included in this letter is a Muggle envelope addressed to Harry Potter from his much-older self.Daphne's letter reveals that elderly Daphne and elderly Harry, after each had outlived a spouse, got married. Marrying Harry Potter, elderly Daphne assures young Daphne, was the best thing to ever happen to elderly Daphne in her long life.Elderly Daphne also tells her teenaged self---Sirius Black's just-read will emancipates almost-sixteen-year-old Harry Potter and grants him the Lordship of the House of Black. In turn, emancipating the Potter Heir turns him into Lord Potter. Harry Potter gaining two Lordships means he'll need two wives. Young Daphne, why wait till you need a cane before you become betrothed to the best man in Wizarding Britain?This is an alt-universe GreenPot Harmony (H/Hr and HP/DG) story that bashes Albus Dumbledore and Ron Weasley.

  An intelligent, well-trained Boy Who Lived comes to Hogwarts and Albus Dumbledore is thrown for a loop. Watch as Harry figures out his destiny as a large threat looms over the horizon, unknown to the unsuspecting magical population. Would Harry Potter be willing to take on his role as the Saviour of Magic or would the world burn in his absence? Harry/Daphne. COMPLETE!

** My personal favorite is linkao3(Harry Potter in the Claw of the Raven) it's the first part of the series and the entire series as a whole is really well done. He doesn't get together with Daphne right away (they're 11) but the do have an extremely close friendship from the beginning and do get together later on.

#+begin_quote
  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.

  They had found peace in each other. The war was over, love had bloomed, things were supposed to look up. It was not meant to be. In a desperate attempt to save his daughter's life, Harry Potter risks past and future. If history must be unwritten, then let it be unwritten. Time-Travel.
