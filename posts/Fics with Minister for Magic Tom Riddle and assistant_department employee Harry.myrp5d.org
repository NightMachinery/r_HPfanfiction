e.g. same vibes as the beginning of Dreams and Darkness Collide or His Darkest Devotion

#+begin_quote
  Harry Evans is a lowly Dark Patrol wizard who's working hard to advance. He doesn't think much of Senior Undersecretary to the Minister Tom Riddle, but on the other hand, a one-night stand that lets them both get rid of tension seems like a good idea. Except that the one night-stand never seems to end.
