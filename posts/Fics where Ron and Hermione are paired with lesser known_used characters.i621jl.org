We know Harry's paired with everyone

Meanwhile if Ron and Hermione aren't paired with each other or Harry, they tend to fall to Lavender or Luna for Ron and Draco/Another Weasley for Hermione

But surely there are fics that have broken the mold?

Something like those Hermione/Padma and Ron/Padma stories from before. Hermione with Terry Boot or Cho Chang, Ron with Susan Bones or Neville or idk

something like that


** There's linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4776013/1/Blood-of-the-Phoenix]]). It's Ron/Daphne. Hermione was single by the end of the fic and everyone is pretty in-character.

** I know quite a few with Hermione, but none with Ron:

- the shape of our memories - linkao3(19265131)

  - It's Millicent Bulstrode/Hermione

- your story's all wrong - linkao3(1243798)

  - It's Cho Chang/Hermione

- Insecurities - linkao3(22145584)

  - It's Pansy Parkinson/Hermione

- Study Stims - linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22191877][22191877]])

  - It's Luna Lovegood/Hermione.

- Ivy - linkao3(3240926)

  - It's Ginny Weasley/Hermione
  - (I know it's another Weasley, but it's a bit rarer?)

- Francais - linkao3(17699189)

  - It's Fleur Delacour/Hermione

- He'll never like you like me - linkao3(17764199)

  - It's Fleur Delacour/Hermione

- Witnessed Here in Time and Blood - linkffn(10090975)

  - It's Fleur Delacour/Hermione

- Amends, or Truth and Reconciliation

  - It's Neville Longbottom/Hermione - linkffn(5537755)
  - There's a bit of Draco/Hermione, Draco Neville and Draco/Hermione/Neville in it, but the main pairing is Neville/Hermione
  - It's technically incomplete, but it reads like a first novel of an entire series. Just no sequel.

There are many other great fics with rarepairs, but I'll send you these to start. I really hope you enjoy them.

  “I don't have to justify my place here to you.” Millicent's voice is like ice, and Hermione can't help herself from flinching, pulling back in her seat to put more distance between them. She's faced down dark wizards, but this feels different. Hermione feels her cheeks warm and thinks about trying to apologise, to take back her words or say something to take away the sting of them, but before she can say anything Millicent snaps, “Why are you here?” After the war Hermione tries to make up for her wartime by working in the Department of Magical Accidents. She's not expecting to end up working at a desk opposite one Millicent Bulstrode, but she'll put up with whatever she has to, if it gives her a chance at getting her parents' memories back.

  Post-DH, Hermione confronts the post-war world, including the wizarding War Crimes Trials of 1999, rogue Dementors, werewolf packs, and Ministry intrigue. All is not well, and this is nothing new. Rated M for later chapters.
