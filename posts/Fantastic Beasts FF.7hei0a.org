These are the ones I liked best. You can check out my bookmarks on AO3 (profile name is also kyella14) if you still want to read more; I've got like 30 bookmarked and I usually go for fics of this sort of tone for Fantastic Beasts fics. Except for the few that are just pure, shameless smut. A warning, though you might have already guessed from the recs I'm giving in this post, the pairings are all Percival/Newt.

  For this gem:Percival is a hot 'A list' Actor and Newt has no clue who he is.Newt becomes the dog walker of Percival Graves the actor, his friends freak out and Newt's confused because he has no idea why. All he knows is that the man is clearly wealthy and Newt's paid really well. Either way, he is almost saved up for the Zoology Trip that could benefit his future in the field. Percival himself is surprised to find someone who doesn't know him, not to be arrogant. These days, he can't walk down the street without body guards or he'd be washed away by a mob of fans. Also he finds Newt's eccentric and obliviousness nature kind of refreshing. Percival likes to make Newt blush or squeamish for fun, because he thinks its kind of cute. Percival then tries to do a little harmless flirting, but Newt being Newt misses the point greatly. This stuns Percival... other ladies and men would be swooning at his feet but nope, not Newt. Oh... the game is on.

  So Graves has been a little stingy with his personal life around the workplace- but the lack of faith his aurors have in his relationship status is a little insulting Or; five times no one believed Graves was married and one time they realized he was telling the truth

  or: Five times Percival Graves said he was married, and one time Tina believed him.When Director Graves starts elaborating on his supposed husband, the entire department is even more certain he doesn't exist - an author and a dragon tamer, who's somehow captured a creature that can kill a hundred wizards at a time? And what sort of name is Newt, anyway?Tina's one of them - at least, until Newt Scamander, magizoologist, shows up in New York and lets a Niffler loose. And when he realises Graves has been replaced by an imposter, things only get more complicated from there.

  After everything the aurors of MACUSA told him about the Director of Magical Security, his new grumpy, ill-tempered boss, Newt decides to do his best to get along with him.But he doesn't know how to do that, so he starts to put into practice his family's advices. The problem is that he doesn't realize he's accidentally flirting with Percival Graves and that said wizard is flirting right back.
