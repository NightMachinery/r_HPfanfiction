*** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11959184/1/][*/Hadrian Lannister Lion of the Rock/*]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1668784/Sage1988][/Sage1988/]]

#+begin_quote
  Reborn as the eldest son of Tywin Lannister, Hadrian must shoulder the responsibilities of being heir to Casterly Rock and play the game of thrones. As war takes hold will he rise to win the game or will he be crushed by the factions all around him. Rated M to be safe.

*** Not this one if I remember right it was legitimately in the Harry Potter world. Like fanon has the noble house of Malfoy Potter black etc but instead of that it was the houses of Westeros.

*** I can't remember all I remember was the description said the families in Harry Potter was either replaced by ( I think) or acted like the house from game of thrones.
