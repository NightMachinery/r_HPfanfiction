Hey all, I'm in a mood where oneshots are a bit too short, but I don't want to commit to hundreds of thousands of words.

Care to share your absolute favorite stories that clock in between 20k-80k words? I'm looking for something short that I can still sink my teeth into for an evening.

--------------

Some (optional) Guidelines:

-While I'd prefer gen, if it has a main pairing I read almost exclusively Het fics. (Feel free to still share slash, as other people enjoy it).

-Completed is a big plus. Good writing even more so.

-Any lead character(s) are fine, but I'd prefer a 'Harry Era' cast, either during or post Hogwarts (basically, if Harry and his peers are alive and kicking, that's the right timeframe).

-Requested length is approximate. Use your judgement.

--------------

I look forward to reading!


** I'm on a Harmony binge right now. Here are some shortish fics I've read.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10871795/1/A-Little-Child-Shall-Lead-Them][A Little Child Shall Lead Them]] by White Squirrel - Hermione timetravels back to when she's a toddler. This one explores a more logical course of action to take when time travelling to the past. Also deals with the problem of what to do after the mission is complete and she's stuck in the past as a toddler.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10687059/1/Returning-to-the-Start][Returning to Start]] by timwunderwood9 - This one is sort of the same, but alot more conservative where Harry bides his time first. It purposefully avoids that awkward situation where an adult person timetravels to his child self and enters a romance with an underage person.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10610076/1/Time-to-Put-Your-Galleons-Where-Your-Mouth-Is][Time to Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is]] by Tsume Yuki - not Harmony. Master of Death Harry is reincarnated as Sirius and Regulus's older brother. Not the best written, but it's a very enjoyable read.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12296750/1/Baby-It-s-Cold-Outside][Baby, It's Cold Outside]] by Potato19 - fluff harmony all the way through.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9649736/1/Thresholds][Thresholds]] by Stanrick - the same as the last one. Also check out Stanrick's other fics. I sort of think Stanrick's writing is a little over the top sometimes, but all they're very well written.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12265183/1/Picnic-Panic][Picnic Panic]] by LeQuin - not the best written fic, but it's fluff where Harry saves Hermione's day.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6959724/1/Lunch-at-Maxine-s][Lunch at Maxine's]] by apAidan- short fic. Has a very cool Mrs. Granger.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11923249/1/Cousin-Harry][Cousin Harry]] by nicnac918 - Dudley has a magical kid and reconnects with Harry. Oneshot but has a sequel.

Edit: added some more

  After the war, Hermione is haunted by the friends she lost, so she comes up with an audacious plan to fix it, starting way back with Harry's parents. Now, all she has to do is get herself taken seriously in 1981, and then find a way to get her old life back when she's done.

  Harry killed them once. Now that he is eleven he'll kill them again. Hermione knows her wonderful best friend has a huge secret, but that just means he needs her more. A H/Hr time travel romance where they don't become a couple until Hermione is twenty one, and Harry kills death eaters without the help of children.

  Most people tend to assume they'll wake up exactly where they fall asleep, and usually they have good reason to do so. For someone, however, even that simple certainty stops being a given one strange night, when quite surprisingly he does in fact not wake up where he fell asleep. And that is only the beginning of what will be one most unusual week in the life of Harry Potter.

** How do you feel about crossovers?

This one starts out looking like a loose connection of ficlets, but the more you read, you realize how it is all connected. Romance isn't really the focus. Sure, characters do have relationships, but it's mainly about the brothers Tony and Harry and how their relationship develops over the years.

I'm quite glad you shared, as it definitely fit the bill. It now ranks up there in my list of favorite crossovers!

I'd like to share a bit of constructive criticism with you: the writing quality on Faultlines is significantly better than Glasshouse, as the latter seems to have more spelling and grammar issues. Just something to consider working on as you continue on sharing the story -- it's clear from Faultlines that you are capable of writing very well, and if you take the extra time needed to edit new chapters more I'm certain your readers will appreciate it :)

** Okay, so here are four stories that blew my damn mind.

And the Wolves All Cry by monroeslittle. A fantastic AU retelling of what would have happened if Snape hadn't heard the prophecy that night. The writing and story is, honestly, heart-wrenching at times. 31.7k words. Linkffn(8809533)

The Pure and Simple Truth by lettered. Set after the war, it's about building bridges. And friendships. And overcoming the past. It's written fantastically; an epitome of ‘show, don't tell.' The character cast is alive and, dare I say it, vibrant. One thing: M/M, although that is hardly noticeable and barely plays a role. I'm not a fan of slash myself, and even feeling reluctant about reading it, I couldn't stop. 65.4k words. Linkao3(392764)

Out of Mind by Galfoy. This is shorter than you asked, 10.4k words. But it's my favorite story to boot. A dramione. It's kind of a mix of melancholy, whimsy and utter bliss; perfect reading for a stormy day. Linkffn(10916225)

The Politician's Wife by pir8fancier. It's a mature dramione. Intelligently written, snarky at times. It was a very relaxing read, and maybe it didn't elicit the same potent feelings as the previous three, but it's fresh in my memory and worth a mention. 68.6k words. Linkffn(2618329)
