** Remus Lupin drank his wolfbane potion before chasing after Sirius and Wormtail.

Then Wormtail would be handed over to the Ministry, Sirius would be exonerated, Voldemort would be stuck in Albania for a very long time, Barty Jr would remain under his dad's control, TWT would proceed normally, Moody would finish his one year term unscathed, Umbridge would not appear at Hogwarts, DA would not get formed, and Death Eaters in Azkaban would be permanently incapacitated.

*** It would be interesting to have the triwizard proceed as it should have. Then it should happen again in Harry's seventh year, if they go by the every three years tournament schedule. It would be an interesting way for a fic to let Harry have enough time to train properly for Voldemort, but not reach into time travel. Voldemort could even try for the same resurrection plan, just delayed 3 years due to the lack of a ready servant.

Remember, this all started when Arthur wanted to pass a Muggle protection law. Lucius didn't want this, so he decided to try and discredit him.

Personally, I think targeting Hermione would be too petty for Lucius. The man is a rich, political figure. What advantage is there to be gained in that area by killing Hermione?

******* I disagree about that. I think just the act of ensuring that T.M. Riddle's diary went to Hogwarts, with Lucius knowing fully well that it would ensure a lot of harm and damage [though whether or not he was aware that Muggle-borns would be petrified due to it], was a "political gain" for Lucius.

I would argue that Lucius's prime target, despite what we are led to believe, was not actually Arthur Weasley. Malfoy disliked Arthur, yes, but there is someone much more politically influential whom he disliked far more: Albus Dumbledore. Compared to Arthur, Dumbledore posed much more of a "threat" to Lucius, and, in turn, the return of Lucius's master, Lord Voldemort.

Compared to Dumbledore as a target, Arthur would have been petty for Lucius Malfoy. Indeed, in /Chamber of Secrets/, Malfoy had near-total control over the Hogwarts board by threatening, blackmailing, or otherwise bribing the other board members. As seen in /Chamber of Secrets/, Lucius's main goal seemed to be getting rid of Dumbledore as Headmaster, something which would have happened anyways, regardless of which student had the Diary, as long as the Diary made it to Hogwarts.

For Lucius, I think he merely slipped the Diary into Ginny's cauldron during a moment of opportunity.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

As I posted in my other reply, Lucius was already irritated and upset that Hermione was besting his Pureblood son, Draco, in all academic fields. By getting rid of Hermione, it would not only rid the school of another Muggle-born, something which Lucius already likely planned to do with the planting of the Diary at Hogwarts, but also move his son closer to to the top of the class. It would also send a "message" to other Muggle-born students, to "put them in their proper place".

But you, fanatical and judgmental, get to point at us and say "you guys don't have anything to offer us, not intelligent discussion really, because you don't like the character I like, and have reduced him to something I disagree with which means you're wrong -- and oh yeah by the way you're bashing because I said so -- so get out of here."

Gladly.

******** The names we use set the tone for the discussion and some are just not conducive to a productive one. "Dumbles," "Dumbledork," "MoRon," "Ginslut," etc. almost never occur in a post that has much to offer the forum, rather like the clever folk peppering their posts with "Bernistas," "Screeching Harpy," or "Democrat Party" over in [[/r/politics]].

And in the end, a solitary downvote is about the mildest form of admonishment one could possibly receive. Talk about overreaction.

Go pet a kitten.

******** I rather think that Lexian's reply to your previous comment answers this one and puts Pers in a more positive light there. He mistakes canon and fanon and doesn't truly seem to want to actually contribute to the discussion but instead to make others see that Dumbledore is all that he sees him as just because he sees him that way.

Is it possible that he is not actually doing that? Sure, it is. But so far the tone of the message (set by the words “Dumbles not being his puppeteering self”) and the intent (shown in his other message) seem to line up and the image they show is ... not positive and makes me think that Pers's decision to downvote is the right one in this case when the message itself is not actually on topic anyway.

So I very much don't think it a form of fanaticism. Could it be that he is jaded? Sure, it is a possibility. But not fanaticism.

***** The guy (who's an asshole, just as bad as Snape - but unlike Snape he's not honest enough to show it, he plays the benevolent grandfather while plotting and scheming behind the scenes!) doesn't deserve his name (and seriously: Voting someone down because his or her opinion doesn't match your own is quite infantile) not being ridiculed (I mean you can say "I'll pull a Dumbledore on this one" and people will most likely understand that you will not tell them jack shit about something after all)

IMHO the guy deserves scorn (!), it's him who put Harry with the Dursleys without checking up on him (out of sight, out of mind more or less -.-), he's also the one who lets bullying (by students, but also by teachers and I am not only talking about Harry either, I am talking about Luna and also Slytherin house as a whole (note: Yes, much of it is probably fanon, but even in canon you get the vibe that Slytherin isn't well liked and it's canon that the twins (from hell) love to prank Slytherins)) happen in his school, he hires crappy teachers (DADA!), he allows newspapers to slander Harry (he should have spoken up against that...he didn't, hell he distanced himself from Harry with a very stupid justification), he doesn't believe in giving Harry extra training (those "Tom-Lessons" were the dumbest thing ever...all of that crap could have been summed up in under half an hour - with the exception of Slughorn's memory maybe!)

Yeah, love potions, Harry being gay, Snape being his dad etc. that's fanon, but what I wrote above is fact!

****** By your own admission, what you consider a "seemingly inconsequential decision" is to completely rewrite what you see as the canon Dumbledore figure. In other words, you've just proved my point about not addressing the OP's question.

I voted you down because not only did you ignore the OP question in order to soapbox, but also because you resorted to infantile name-calling instead of just making your point (which wasn't much of one in the context of the discussion). Were I to refer to you by the appellation 'Laxative,' would you not agree that it would add nothing to what I say and would serve only to bait hostile responses? Would it not make the tone less amiable and more confrontational?

Engage with ideas and I'll respond with same even if (especially if) I disagree. Resort to lazy name-calling (Dumbles, Dumblefuck, Dumbleass, Ginslut, Ginbitch, MoRon, The Ginger Retard, Umbitch, Longass, etc.) and I'll just downvote and move on.

** what if harry had convinced the teachers quirell had gone after the stone.

it turn out the only reason his blood made him into something similar in the rebirth ritual to a horcrux was because his soul was split from that murder. harry doesn't survive the second killing curse and voldemort wins, and becomes the master of the elder wand.

*** Harry was a pseudo Horcrux since Voldemort attacked the Potters and killed his parents when Harry was 1. It's also very strongly implied that the act of committing unadulterated murder without feeling remorse is what splits your soul. Killing in Self Defense or even in War most likely won't do it.

*** You're getting downvotes because nothing of that is true.

First, it wasn't a murder, Harry's soul wasn't split. At worst it was self-defence, and at best an accident. Even if Harry's soul had been damaged, the blood ritual does not even come close to the horcrux ritual and would not have ever split. The reason he survived is that Harry was already a horcrux, seeing how he had a piece of Voldemort's soul in his scar. This was a huge point in the story, I don't really know how you're confusing it with something else. I don't recall it even being explicitly said that Harry's blood anchored his soul to Voldemort, though there were hints so I guess I can excuse it a little bit.

As for the story itself, say the teachers kill Quirrel without any losses, and therefore everything else is equal, Voldemort still uses Harry's blood in the ritual granting him protection even though he doesn't know he needs it, therefore Harry still survives the second AK and defeats Voldemort. But most importantly, lacking a confrontation with the Big Bad in the first book, no triumphs for the main character, Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone loses out on almost all of the praise the real book got, is flopped by the publisher and the series never even gets off the ground, whereas most of the other suggestions in this thread result in a decent story regardless.

**** dumbledore told him that the blood and the protection are what are protecting him from dying, so he can go back. i'm pretty sure that is all that was said about him surviving. in the same way that he just 'had a bit of voldi power in his scar' for years, and it turns out to be a bit of soul. i just got downvoted because they like the opposite fannon ideas.

that aside, the general point was the only important one. if harry hadn't killed quirinus quirrell himself, what would happen.

***** Nobody /in the book/ knows exactly why Harry survived, Dumbledore included. He is making guesses about love and blood and stuff, guesses that are not wholly inaccurate, but in the end he doesn't know either.

Might it be that? Sure, it might very well be. But it could also be the effect of the hallows united under one master, or it could be a combination of the two or even something else entirely. /We/ know which it is, he doesn't.

And Harry attempting to stop Quirrel from killing him is just that, an attempt to stop someone from harming him that had more of an effect because of a factor he did not know about. He did not actually desire for the man to die, let alone think about murdering him, so there is no way their meeting in the first book could result in Tom in any way being Harry's horcrux.
