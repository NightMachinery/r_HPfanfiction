** Honestly, I'd see it containing entire libraries worth of tomes, on every subject, towering upward and out of sight, but when you open any of those tomes, it's just a fake book with the pages cut out to hide bottles of whisky.

Ravenclaw and Gryffindor were the tower people, and I really like the idea of Rowena having to hide her stash of booze because Godric kept drinking it all.

But if you wanted to take a more serious approach, I'd have it be a mix of factual reference and spellcrafting journals. Essentially have it be Ravenclaw's private spell-crafter lab, and imagine what she'd need in easy reach to do that.
