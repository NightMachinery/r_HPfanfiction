Because my gay ass realized how much potential any of the gryffindor chaser girls together would have, anyone have anything like that?


** There are some oneshots in [[https://archiveofourown.org/tags/Katie%20Bell*s*Alicia%20Spinnet/works?commit=Sort+and+Filter&page=1&utf8=%E2%9C%93&work_search%5Bquery%5D=otp%3Atrue][this]] search, and if you filter for katie & alicia on ffn you'll find some more very short bits, but unfortunately I don't know of anything longer. The AO3 oneshots are generally higher quality in my experience. Katie & Alicia is the most common, I assume because Angelina dated Fred in canon and their respective ages.
