**** I don't know, how about a age limit? When a person has a certain age the jinx doesn't work on them. Like teachers under 40 only teach 1 year.

** A new headmaster? Once the promise breaking headmaster (Dumbledore) is gone, the jinx is up because the new headmaster didn't break any promises? Does this make sense?

Not sure how to get Harry to be the one to life the jinx though... but maybe he could solve it?

*** If you wanted to keep Dumbledore you could just have him take a sabbatical for a year or something and then get his job back once the jinx is clear.

** I mean, there's four possible lines of thought I'd take the solution to that curse down. Keep the promise, trick the wording, find the counter, and obligatory tasks.

Keep the promise being the idea of somehow giving Riddle the job, which would probably be some bureaucratic trickery given that that the Marauders era was the 70s and the Jinx was theoretically placed sometime in the 50s, 60s, or 70s (I can't find any mention of an exact timeframe for his second application, only that he was then going by Voldemort full time). So, he could've been off doing shit for 20 years at this point, meaning it'd probably be a distance learning post or something. :D

Trick the wording would be some sort of 'well, you don't go by 'Tom Riddle' anymore, and we promised nothing to Voldemort' type wordplay. Basically, think about what a teaching contract would say and ways in which that wording could be twisted to justify not giving Riddle the Job or only giving him a certain thing instead of what he thought he was getting, etc.

Find the counter is basically just Rowling's 'every curse has a counter-curse, every jinx has a counter-jinx' etc thing. Maybe Harry does some investigation and happens to be the one to make/find the right spell to get rid of it.

Obligatory Tasks would be finding the loophole in the jinx or fulfilling it in some way to make it go away. It's the traditional fairy-tale/mythology path, where someone finds a curse, then has to go do things or find things to make it go away. Like the God Baldur was enchanted to be immune to all wounds and harm, except for mistletoe. So, you find Mistletoe, then you can stab the fecker. Same principle with the Jinx (maybe long-lasting or powerful Jinxes have side-effects that give those 'obligatory task requirements').

** Have Dumbledore hire Voldemort, then fire him. Did Dippet say he could have the job for life?
