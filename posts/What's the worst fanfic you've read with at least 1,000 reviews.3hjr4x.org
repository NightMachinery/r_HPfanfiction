** Robst's story and its 13 clones. They all have 1k+ and they're all essentially the same story: Harry and Hermione (and sometimes Luna) are soulmates, the good guys are good and smart, the bad guys are bad and stupid.

The whole thing is so cringe-y. There is never any drama or conflict in the relationship, and the good guys are so OP that there's never any drama there either.

** There are far too many clichéd fics using these parameters for me to give a truly decisive answer on the matter. Just looking through Fanfiction.net in order of reviews yields some truly dire pieces of literature. There's so much MPreg Draco/Harry, soul bond Harry/Ginny and !Independant!Dark-But-Not-Evil!25,000-Words-Of-Diagon-Alley-Shopping-Trip drivel that it is hard to pick one specific fic.

However, I think i'll choose Partially Kissed Hero. Not just because it was a bad piece of fanfiction (of which it definitely is) but because it transcends poor writing into being a nothing more than a mouthpiece for the writers beliefs. I shall avoid any further delving further into it lest I simply echo what has already been said on the matter, but it's really bad. Like almost offensive at times.

** I really don't like Harry Potter - Three to Backstep by Sinyk. There were quite a few issues that I had with the story, but probably the biggest one is that his main three characters were inconsistent and unlikable. I mean, my general default to people is a combination of apathy and general well-wishing, but I feel like I would actively dislike these people. Similarly, I just do not like anything by DZ2. The stories, which are usually responses to challenges, don't take long to fall back onto common tropes, and honestly, a lot of them are basically interchangeable. Sure, the challenges may vary, but DZ2's approach doesn't - is the same view of the characters with small variations.

*** As soon as I saw the title, the name Dz2 immediately came to mind as well, lol. To be fair, unless I remember wrongly, his writing in a technical sense is quite good.

However, in the two stories of his that I attempted to read, he tries to make Harry Potter sound like the badass of all badasses. He has all these awesome, grandiose and badass lines to deliver to his enemies. Then I imagine him reciting them in his eleven year old squeaky voice... and just no.

About Sinyk: Again, a very good writer technically. But, reading a story of his ( don't remember which one) I saw him abuse plot devices abundantly to fit his plot. ( Magical oaths to solve everything, and the use of some special orbs that would upload Merlin's knowledge to eleven year old children) So... a bit meh again, I guess.

Edit: Oops, I thought this was the 'What is the most over the top story you have read' thread, so that is the title I referenced on my first paragraph; anyway, those points remain.

** Can I just take a moment to clear a misconception? 1000 reviews isn't a lot if you can pump out a lot of chapters in a generic fanfiction. There are an obscene amount of people in the Harry Potter fandom, all of which could be leaving reviews from "OOOOOOOHHHH please ship Snarry, I don't think this story would be good with a Drarry pairing" or "Meh, this story bashes too much. I don't see why you had to have Ron die by having him fall into a pit of dicks that just started fucking him to death."

Unfortunately, Fanfiction.net would use both as indication of popularity, despite it not actually being well received. If you want to sort by actual popularity and a fic being well-received, search by follows or favorites.

*** I liked it when I first read it (apart from the sex scenes), but these days I think it's too contrived and suffers from a common failing of many stories: Despite massive changes to many characters, the canon plot still happens more or less as in the books. Even if "it all appears to have gone down as in Canon, but in reality..." is the base of the story, it's rather unlikely that that would have happened - the explanations in the Story itself don't make always sense, in my opinion.

Yes but when the medium that this science is being conveyed to us through is Harry applying science to magic it is necessary to actually show the science in action. 99% of the time Harry goes "I think that X applies here because tenuous link" then it's never mentioned again.

I did, it relies on partial transfiguration right? So you've got a thing (PT) that doesn't exist in canon being used to solve everything and it exists because Harry thinks really hard about these equations he talks about. These equations do not exist. They are theorised by some but they have not been quantified.

You have no idea, if you haven't finished the story about the various amounts of foreshadowing and clues that hinted towards future events in the story.

For fans of HPMOR, this was really fun. We were attempting to predict what Professor Quirell really was, how horrible or not horrible he was, how things were going to end, and more. Not to mention that at the end of the story, we were given a seemingly hopeless situation that the protagonist was in, and the author challenged the entire subreddit to come up with a solution.
