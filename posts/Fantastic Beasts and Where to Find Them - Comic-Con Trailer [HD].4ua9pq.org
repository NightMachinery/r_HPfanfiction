** I love nearly everything about this trailer. That being said...those goblins look ridiculous and completely out of line with the established species from the books. I get this is America but still...really hope they aren't going to do the shit fanon version of America where everything is progressive. I thought the announcement of how they treated muggles put an end to that but it seems not.
