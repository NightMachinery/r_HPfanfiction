I remember very little, only that he asked them to promise to keep what happened in the dorm completely private under the premise that they all had secrets.

Does anyone remember it?

  The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. slytherin!harry, dark!harry, eventual slash, lv/hp
