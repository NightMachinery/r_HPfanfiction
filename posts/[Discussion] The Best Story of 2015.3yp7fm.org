So, 2015 ends in three days (two for some of you out there). Post *one* story, published within this year, that you enjoyed the most. It would also be great if you could write why you enjoyed it as well.


** I'll start us off. My favorite was linkffn(The Lesser Sadness by Newcomb)

It's one of the few Super!Harry stories that I've really enjoyed. It takes a rather cliché idea, and turns it into an incredible story. It's one of those stories that get better every time you read it. Very well-written with great characterization, brilliant action scenes, and a lot of awesome stuff. It also has a unique pairing (Harry/Penelope), which I really like.

  When Unspeakable Harry Potter wakes up in 1976, he determines he's either A: In the past. Or B: In a mental hospital. At least the firewhiskey still tastes the same. Waiting tables at the Three Broomsticks, drunken death eater bar fights, annoying an attractive but pushy auror, and avoiding his mother's crush on him is just another day in the life of Harry Potter, 1976

** linkffn(Grow Young With Me)

Post Hogwarts Family/Romance. An amazing OC and an all around incredible fic.

*** I read this earlier this week and while I /liked/ it, it's not really a Harry Potter fic. What I mean by that is it doesn't /feel/ like a Harry Potter story, and the Potterverse elements it does use seem tacked on and unnecessary. This would have worked just fine as a standalone story with original characters and no magic, maybe making the main character a police officer or government agent if Harry's Auror work actually matters to the plot. [[/spoiler][Given how many times Unspeakable Roth has been offhandedly mentioned since the flashback to the botched raid, I wouldn't be surprised if it turns out Ginny's death wasn't an accident.]]

The Potterverse characters also feel... off somehow. The only character who feels like an adult version of their canon self is Hermione, who the author absolutely /nails/ (intelligent, protective of her friends, and willing to go behind their backs if she feels it's necessary). This might be the best adult Hermione I've ever read.

I'm also not convinced the author has ever met a child. Harry's children are all unrealistically perfect, with their only "flaws" being amusing pranks, manipulating people with their cuteness, or minor sibling squabbles that are easily broken up. Not that I /want/ them to be a disruptive force in the story, but it feels like they are only present because they were in the epilogue. It's just another way the story suffers for being a fanfic.

Again, I should stress I did enjoy this fic, I just think it'd work better as a standalone story.

** If The Lesser Sadness was a bit longer I would likely support that, but as that isn't the case, I'll instead mention linkffn(800-Rent-A-Hero).

I'm generally a sucker for time/dimensional travel, so it automatically earns a plus for me there. It takes it time to set things up, with Harry's dimensional counterpart not entering the story in the flesh until... 10 chapters in? It takes a while, anyways.

I'm also fairly fond of Harry as a teacher, though since Harry is best treated by mistreating him, it shouldn't be in something he excels in. Rather, he has to become the Divination Professor which he is... not quite qualified for, initially. He gets better, and one of the weaker points of the story is perhaps that it makes him a bit too good at it, too quickly, while making it a bit too useful to have fallen into disregard as it has.

Another aspect I enjoy is that it takes many INDY-HARRY-FUCK-YEAH! tropes/cliches, runs with it, and shows how it's generally for the worse.

** Not many top fics this year, although 0800-Rent-A-Hero will become a classic in a few years time, I'm sure. Most I enjoyed have been mentioned, but I'm currently liking linkffn(The Brightest Witch and the Darkest House) . Hermione is not a witch, but another girl is. There's changes to the story, I'm sure a few more in later years, since the sequel was released just a few days ago. The OC is also interesting and a refreshing change of pace with an original pairing. And a female is in Slytherin and the main character without being needlessly paired with Draco or Snape! Yay!

  What happens if the 'brightest witch of her age' is very different than Hermione? Would there be a golden trio? Would the fate of Britain be brighter, darker or unchanged? What is dark and what is evil and how much do choices matter? Slow break from canon initially, full break at book 3. Lots of magic, action, reasonably competent Harry and friends, PoV is potential dark witch.

** linkffn(The Shadow of Angmar by Steelbadger;The Black Prince by cxjenious;Grow Young With Me by Taliesin19;Out of the Dark and into the Green by Chim Cheree)

Tied for top are Shadow of Angmar and Grow Young With Me. At most basic, it is the consistently well done character growth for both fics that gets me. Black Prince is a favorite but I can't rate it better till I see more HP magic introduced. Fic that I think will grow a lot in popularity is Out of the Dark and into the Green. Technically published mid December 2014

*** Prince of Slytherin started pretty strong, but since its gotten in CoS it's really fell off in quality. The 2nd book is already as long as the first and it isn't even christmas. The author has lost focus and the story has gone everywhere. Also the 30 year old 12 year olds has really gotten out of hand. I really dislike this Lockhart too. I'm still reading, but it wouldn't take much to make me stop.

** It's a relatively late entry in the year, but linkffn(Nine Lives Too Many by Fahad09) is shaping up to be a pretty amazing fic. Basically, instead of Severus Snape as the head of Slytherin, we've got the History of Magic teacher who just happens to be a talking cat (technically an Animagus, but why be a human when you can be a cat?). There's slightly more than that going on, but all in all it's just a real joy to read.

  Mr Granger felt as if the whole world was spinning as he listened to the Hogwarts Professor speak of magic, Hogwarts and his daughter being a witch. But it wasn't what the Professor was saying that had left him feeling so dumbfounded, but what he looked like. "You're a cat." "Yes," the Professor cocked his furry little head, "I thought that was obvious." AU (Not an OC or SI Fic)
