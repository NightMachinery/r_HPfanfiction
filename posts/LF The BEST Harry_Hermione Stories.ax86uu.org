Hi everyone,

I'm wanting to try out some Harry/Hermion fics. Which are the best? Which are your favorites?

​

Thanks!


** I'd suggest checking [[/r/HPHarmony][r/HPHarmony]], the dedicated subreddit for the pairing.

** Here's some of my favorites off the top of my head in no particular order.

- The Mark by Nargled. It's a short story wherein Harry and Hermione deal with the remaining Death Eaters after the war in a clever way. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11252584/1/The-Mark]])

- Returning to the Start by timunderwood9. A time travel fic wherein Harry goes back in time and Takes Care Of Business in a somewhat believable manner. Bonus points for him not getting into a creepy relationship with Hermione while she's 13 and he's mentally 30. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10687059/1/Returning-to-the-Start]])

- Coming Back Late by alchymie. Totally awesome fic. Deathly Hallows and politics and wonderful characterization. Sadly, it's been abandonded, but there's enough present to provide an exciting read, the story's climax, and a good bit of the resolution. Several points are left hanging, but what'cha gonna do? One of the best HHr fics ever written IMHO. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6471922/1/Coming-Back-Late]])

- Time in the Fire by Odment Tweak. This might be my all-time favorite fic. It's not perfect, but it knows how to hit you right in the feels. It's a time-travel fic with a twist. I've probably read this one 50 times. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6033933/1/Time-is-the-Fire]])

- Resistence by lorien829, or really anything by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/636397/lorien829][loriend829]] for that matter. She's got several wondeful fics that are all worth reading, this is just my favorite of the bunch. It was written before Deathly Hallows - so there's some differences there. It's from Hermione's perspective in a world where Voldemort won the last battle, and it follows how the surviving good guys continue the fight. It's pretty awesome. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2746577/1/Resistance]])

- Notebooks and Letters by chemprof. This is the fic that got me interested in the HHr pairing years ago. The premise is that the published HP books are an embelished telling of the events that really took place. Hermione sits down with her daughter and gives her the real story through reading her old diaries and letters. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3867175/1/Notebooks-and-Letters]])

- Harry Potter and the Lost Demon by Angry Hermione. Written before Deathly Hallows, so again, some differences there. The author is excellent and her characters are spot on. She also adds some new and very imaginative elements to the HP world. She also plays with the soul bond and love potion tropes in a way that is incredibly creative - it's the only time I can think of that they've been done well. Excellent story. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2993199/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Lost-Demon]])

- [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/7700][Hermione Granger and the Goblet of Fire]] by Coulsdon Eagle. Origingally published on the now defunct Portkey.org, this fic adds some changes to year 5. Because of some tricky magic with unintended consequences, Hermione's name comes out of the Goblet of Fire instead of Harry's. It's a great story. I remember following it as it was being published and the excitement that came with each new update. [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/7700]]

- Finally, if you're looking for something on the lighter and/or funnier side of things, check out what [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/author/5876][kyc639]] published back in the day - again originally on Portkey.org but now archived. He wrote Harry with a great, sarcastic sense of humor. Well worth checking out. [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/author/5876]]

- And then of course there's my humble addition to the fandom: linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9203082/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Knight-of-the-Radiant-Heart]]) It doesn't really stand with the above fics, but I'm adding it anyways.

Enjoy!

I always thought that it was a matter of it only being two chapters, and that it was published in only two days. Thus, it wouldn't have had much time in the recently published list to attract attention before fading in with all the other HP fics.

  What happened to the Other Hermione that Harry encountered in "Shadow Walks"? As she struggles to survive, despite immense loss, in a world that no longer has a place for her, how will the reappearance of someone she'd thought she'd never see again change her life completely? Reading "Shadow Walks" first is advised. Companion piece; alternate universe.

  Most people tend to assume they'll wake up exactly where they fall asleep, and usually they have good reason to do so. For someone, however, even that simple certainty stops being a given one strange night, when quite surprisingly he does in fact not wake up where he fell asleep. And that is only the beginning of what will be one most unusual week in the life of Harry Potter.

  When a young green-eyed wizard and a minimally older brown-eyed witch, the best of friends for years, discover their mutual fondness for one particular armchair in front of one particular fireplace, it can inevitably mean one thing and one thing only: War.

** It's an older fic, but I've recently started reading [[https://old.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/ax4304/inventors_in_harry_potter/ehrnspp/?context=3][Magic Never Dies]] by Lynney, and I really like the H/Hr relationship.

It's generally recommended that you download the story as an epub/mobi from the website I linked because the web version doesn't have italics and formatting.
