******* To be fair, I am with [[/u/rachrox92]] here. There are characters which I have come to utterly despise due to fanfiction because their portrayal is always in a way I dislike. I have nothing against the canon Weasley twins or Neville, but I am not touching any fanfics where they play a major role because I am sick and tired of pranks or "growing up to be his own man" (the average Neville arc when he is not the antagonist).

** I'm the opposite- I don't like Hinny because all the fics I read in the beginning of my fanfiction reading were Super!Harry where she was just arm candy, and they ruined the ship for me. Putting proper, sassy Ginny and Harry into a relationship together also weirds me out ‘cause I always pegged that as a ‘commiserating bisexual friendship'. I adore friendship stories between the two, but that's essentially non-existent, so...

#+end_quote

So, according to you, the only way HP can connect to a female is if she's either had her parents die in a war, or if she was possessed by a Dark Lord?

That's ridiculous.

I personally don't like HP/HG because it's overdone as hell, and makes HG into someone who can never do any wrong (although this is done with fics where the HP/HG pairing isn't there as well) instead of being the generally annoying character she actually is. I don't like HP/GW, because going out with your best friend's sister is just a big no in my book. Having said that, Changeling was one of the best I've read so far.

Luna, Daphne, Tonks, Fleur - if it's well written, I'll read along.

He was her "love" when she was a kid, then he saved her in her first year. In my opinion she love hero, not the person. She doesn't know him. Not like Hermione or Luna. With Luna he has this weird connection. And Hermione was his best friend, always by his side. Tonks.. eh, I don't know, I don't feel chemistry beetwen this two.

*** Any Tonks pairing is not based on their canon chemistry. It's based on her OOTP characterisation, where she was a funny woman with a devil may care attitude but also a sense of duty and a positive attitude. She was the only one who was not doom and gloom at Grimmauld. It also has a certain "We shouldn't be doing this" factor, the forbidden fruit so to say.

Or on the fact that she is, without contest, the most attractive person in the entire series. She could mirror anyone else and even improve on them.

Edit: There is no canon chemistry between them because they really just have two scenes together (packing in OotP and the hike to Hogwarts). If you want to write that pairing with any depth, you need more than that. I'm writing that pairing and even I admit that it has absolutely no canon base since the whole "bonding over superficial people" is bad fanon and there's no indication that Tonks dislikes her abilities or the reception she gets for them. Like many interesting pairings, it has some potential based on what we see from the characters, but the author is the one who has to do all the work.

** Personally the farther away from cannon, the more I like the romance. HP/GW? Bleh. HP/HG? Super bleh, I don't particularly care for it in general and more than that the execution is often shit IMHO. HP/Luna I don't particularly like just cause I find Fanon! Luna..bleh, just not my cuppa tea. HP/Greengrass or Fleur, or even further afield? Love that shit. I guess I just like HP/OC with that thin veneer of cannon compliance.

** I'm the opposite. In canon, Ginny is a Mary-Sue. In fanfiction, she's just arm candy. In both, she's the Hot Quidditch Girl, and since Harry's straight, he has to marry the female version of Ron.

So yeah, I've yet to read a good fic with Ginny as the main love-interest. Hermione, on the other hand... A lot of people mess her up, but she has a lot more depth to her than Ginny ever managed.

Right, instead you prefer Ginny, who has barely any established character at all and incorporates all of these things when convenient to the plot or the romance.

In Hinny fics Ginny is always the exact right amount of smart/cool/quirky to be the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3942021/1/Perfection][perfect partner]] for Harry.

** I can't do HP/HG. Not sure why, but I've never been able to convince myself to read one. The only Harry/Luna stuff I've come across is poorly written smut. I've read a couple good Daphne Greengrass stories, but I feel like those are easy to take because she's just a name. There's a lot of cornball Hinny stuff to wade through, but when Ginny is written well, she's my favorite.

** I'll read anything so long as it's well written. So long as the characters are well written and not "In Name Only" I'll go ahead and give it a read and it's usually something else that makes me tap out of the fic.

With that said,

#+end_quote

Everyone has their pairing, but wtf are you even talking about here. Canonically, unknown what's going on with Susan's parents.

Also something they can "connect" with? It's fanfiction, the writer can write in anything to make those character's connect with Harry, even in canon compliant fics.

For just canon: Hermione can't connect with the shared adventure experiences? Luna can't connect with having been bullied and treated poorly by those her age? Fleur can't connect with people only seeing their surface and not their depth? Tonks can't connect with losing family?

Daphne is a blank slate, writers can give her anything they want to connect with Harry.

#+begin_quote
  it seems as if fanfic writers make mary sues out of the Main 5 Harry is paired with
#+end_quote

They do that with Ginny too. A ton of stories contain mary/gary sues, that's just how it works with fanfiction. There's nothing wrong with not liking those stories, people don't. Just seems weird to me personally to attribute mary sue to those five characters, when it is there writer's fault for doing that and, there are stories out there with those pairings that don't have them as mary sues

** It's just personal preference, and yeah, a lot of people don't like pairing Harry with anyone other than Ginny.

That's fine.

But there's a lot of potential in non-canon pairings that I find (theoretically) more interesting. The executions can often leave something to be desired, so I don't really read shipping-heavy fics these days ...

... but if I had to choose a top three of ones I'd read for Harry, I'd pick Harry/Cho, Harry/Luna, and Harry/Neville.

Don't know why. Popular ships usually don't interest me as much. Could be over saturation or lack of appeal. Harry/Hermione is one that I've tried to get, but never have. To me, they come across as friends in canon.

I don't get Harry/Ginny, either, though. Not the best friends part, but to put it in Trope-speak, it comes off as [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrangledByTheRedString][Strangled by the Red String]] to me. Bad pacing, not enough characterization, sudden "chest monsters," etc.

(Ron/Hermione also feels off to me, too, for similar reasons -- they read like friends, and the pacing/characterization is lackluster.)

** I'm probably one of the most diehard H/G shippers on this forum, but do you really think that Ginny is somehow exempt from bad writing? More than 90% of all fanfiction is crap, and that applies to all pairings, including H/G (to a lesser extent than Harry/Draco or even H/Hr, though). If you head to [[/r/HarryandGinny]] there are threads where what we don't like about Ginny in fanon is discussed.

** Personally speaking I'm the exact opposite way round. I'll take Harry paired with nearly anyone else, except Ginny. By far the easiest way to get me to nope out of a story is to pair Harry with Ginny.

Then again that's probably because I'm of the opinion that Harry and Ginny should have never been paired in canon in the first place. I literally screamed when I read that part of the ending of DH because no. Just NO.

If anyone, Harry should have ended up paired with Hermione. Even JKR herself in more recent years has admitted that those pairings were a mistake.

So yeah suffice to say any Harry/Ginny pairing just completely ruins the story for me.

Otherwise, I am the complete opposite from you!

I normally leave Harry/Ginny the hell alone (their relationship is to out left field for me!), I can take it if it is well writen - but even then I usually prefer not to!

Also: Ron with Hermione? That pairing makes me want to find a barf-bag! Seriously, we even have WOG that this is basically only canon because Rowling liked the idea (she didn't think about it much, if she had? She would have seen that those two would file for divorce within 2 years IMHO, especially since I believe that Hermione either doesn't want kids or wants them after having established herself professionally - she's muggleborn, so no having kids straight out of school!)

*** You go to FFN, set Ginny as character and sort by favourites. Pretty much everything on the first few pages is either horribly dated (NoFP) or straight up bad (OP Harry, harems, Lord Potter-Black-Gryffindor, Hermione bashing, protagonists without flaws, Hermione paired with any Weasley, soul bonds, way too early/serious romances where everyone finds their true love by age 15, Death Eater apologism).

I would love to enjoy a Ginny fic which takes her OotP characterisation as a BAMF and a slow building relationship between teenagers (attraction -> lust -> love). Sadly, if you find the other Weasleys utterly boring and like Hermione as Harry's best friend, that leaves very little choice.

Ironically, the best characterisations I have found were in smut, whereas the "regular" stories either turn her back into ideal GF/fangirl/armcandy instead of a character with depth and agency or make Harry follow her around like a mindless minion. I see the potential but so far it is untapped. Give me a Harry/Ginny story where she has a similar characterisation to either Hermione or Tonks in "Grains of Sand in the Hourglass", one where she acts like Lisa Turpin in "Call Me" out of Teenage rebellion, where she acts like "Harry"/Jamie in "Jamie Evans and Fate's fool. Like Meera Reed in ASOIAF. Like an actual character and not just a few background appearances outside of book 5.
