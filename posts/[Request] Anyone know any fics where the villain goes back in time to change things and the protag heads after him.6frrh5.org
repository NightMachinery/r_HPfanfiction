Already read Wastedlands of Time. Any others out there?


** The two I can think of are linkffn(I'm Still Here by Kathrin518; To End in Serenity by MattSilver)

I should say -- in both of these, Voldemort from the old timeline doesn't show up much.

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.

  The war's not over. Voldemort created one last Horcrux and sent it back in time, and Harry, Ron and Hermione have to travel back to destroy it and prevent that timeline's Voldemort from rising once and for all, all while doing some good old fashioned meddling along the way. HP/OFC, RW/HG, RL/NT.
