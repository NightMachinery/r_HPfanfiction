I dont really remember much but i do remember that harry was hunted by the ministry and he went back in time and met captain America and went on several raids with him i think he was friends with Abraham Erskine sorry to be so vague.


** Sounds like linkffn(Prometheus Bound) to me, but it's been a while since I've read any of it.
