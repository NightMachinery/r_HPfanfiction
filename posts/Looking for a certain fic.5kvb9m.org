I recall a specific scene in it, in which Harry storms into the Great Hall, publically reams Ravenclaw House a new asshole over the theft of Luna's things, rots their table away and dumps them all on the ground, then storms right back out and obliterates Ravenclaw's hourglass as a finale.

  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway.

Buried by the prospect of his toughest year at Hogwarts yet. In the face of his fate, what can he do but keep moving forwards?
