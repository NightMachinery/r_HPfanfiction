Are there any fics that are completely canon compliant where Harry is sent to another dimension where his parents are still alive?


** I haven't come across any, but I'm sure there are quite a few out there - if you wouldn't mind a semi-canon compliant alternate dimension fic, check out Stages of Hope. linkffn(6892925). It's really good.

  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.
