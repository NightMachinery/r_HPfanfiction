I see this misspelled so often in fics, I wondered what if it did say "loose" and no one had paid attention to it till now.

** (Ooh man does that bother me! They're totally different, in pronunciation and meaning. The fact that I see this mistake so often drives me crazy!)

Harry Potter found his eyebrows to be rising into his hairline inch by inch as the seconds ticked on into minutes, then minutes into hours. He paid no attention to the bored and restless crowd of people who had long since resigned themselves to being stuck here, in this cramped room, all night. Instead, his eyes bore into the long scroll of parchment sprawled out in front of him.

Long would actually be an understatement, it reached all the way across the desk, fell onto the floor, and wrapped itself around the room in a barely organized fashion.

Harry was only halfway through all 32 feet of parchment by the 1AM mark. And he was decidedly /not/ impressed.

To put it simply, the contract was a mess. Originally codified in the year 1267, it was written in middle English and later had 83 revisions to it across the span of the next several hundred years. It grossly mashed together dialects from 700 years and it was just as grossly misinterpreted.

But the worst misinterpretation was under Article 4, in which one specific word had been badly misunderstood.

By the time 4AM came around, Harry's eyebrows had nearly dissappeared into his hairline, "This is absolute codswallop, nonsense, rubbish, and utterly ridiculous tomfoolery!" Harry exclaimed.

With a loud snort Madam Maxime woke from her slumber and rubbed a heavy hand against her eyes, "Oh mon Dieu! Iz za asinine child finally done?! We've been here all night! Dumbles, I hope zis izn't how you treat ozer ladiez!"

Dumbledore, who had only slightly dozed off, roused and gave the headmistress an apologetic smile, "I apologize, Madam. I assure you it is not."

Karkaroff, who hadn't slept at all but had instead been staring daggers into Harry's head for the past 9 hours, somehow makes his gaze deadlier, "This is insane. So much trouble for this unverschämt, idiotisch boy."

"Now now," reassured Bagman with a sleepy grin, "Mr. Potter has the right to look over the contract."

Crouch, interestingly enough, scowls, "Why! The rules are the same! The contract clearly states that, should a player refuse to compete, they lose their magic! He'd be... He'd be... /reduced to a squib/! A squib!"

Harry would be more offended if he wasn't feeling so victorious right now.

With a smile he gets up from his chair, and faces the group of ministry officials, headmasters and mistresses, and fellow triwizard tournament competitors. All looking at him expectantly.

"Except I won't."

It's silent for a moment.

Then, "What?!" Squawks Crouch.

Harry pushes his glasses up his nose, "I said, I won't. I won't become a squib."

Before Crouch can say anything else -- or before Karkaroff starts throwing curses his way -- Professor Dumbledore cuts in, "Whatever do you mean, Harry?"

"I mean... There's a discrepancy between the document and everyone's apparent understanding of it. Specifally in Article 4, Section 2, Clause A, line 28 to 34."

"Please elaborate. I think we're all due an explanation at this point." Dumbledore says, kindly.

"The contract states, and I quote, '/Whomever shalt not take full hand in their own part of thy Triad of Magicals, within as much steadfast effort as thy souls allowest, shalt receive as follows: A loss of thy chance of thy victors rewards, just compensation for any ailments thou attains whilst taking part in the Triad of Magicals, and.../'"

He pauses to look around, meeting their eyes with an excited glint in his own.

"Now listen closely because this is what's interesting. /'...and thine magic shall be loose from it's bindings within thine soul.'/"

He grins triumphantly. Then he counts down in his head.

/3/

/2/

/1/

"And? You've just confirmed what I've been saying all along!" Says Crouch, nearly pulling his hair out.

/There it is... There's always people who don't know the difference between two simple words. And they call/ me /dumb!/

Harry sighs, reaches into his robe's pockets, and pulls out his pocket copy of the Oxford dictionary. A gift given to him by his old elementary English teacher.

"A common misconception, Mr. Crouch. I said /loose/ not /lose/."

He thumbs through the large volume, running his fingers against the worn pages, until he lands on the right entry.

"Lets see... /'Loose, adjective. Not securely fixed where it should be; able to become separated from something.'/ Or, /'Not tied together; not held in position by anything or contained in anything.'/ Or, -- and I'm sure this is the correct terminology referenced in the contract -- /'Free to move around without control; not tied up or shut in somewhere.'/"

Dumbledore had a sudden twinkling light to his eyes, his wrinkles becoming laugh lines, mirth written across his face from sudden understanding.

A small chuckle, "What a silly mistake to make. I think... I must apologize to you Harry, and to the rest of you all, for a night and morning wasted."

"I do not understand." Came a confused Fluer, "My eenglish iz not too good to know, I'm sorry."

"I am also... lost." Krum says.

Before Harry can answer Cedric beats him to it, "There's a problem with the contract... I think?"

Dumbledore nods, "Indeed there has been. Such a small oversight but it's definitely caused a massive headache. It seems like all this has been for naught."

Harry gives the proffesor a sheepish look, "Sorry sir. But on the bright side we can all go to bed now and forget this ever happened. I won't be competing."

Everyone seems to let out a collective, if exasperated, sigh. All of them ready to file out the door.

Except one.

"I-I don't understand! Won't you lose -- or I mean... loose your magic? What's the difference?" Demands Crouch, a wild look in his eyes.

Harry looks at the man, unimpressed, "I don't /lose/ my magic, sir. It goes /loose/. It's set free from bindings in the soul... Whatever that means. But I'm assuming that it would allow me to access parts of my magic more thoroughly. Probably not worth the risk of dying though."

Surprisingly, Crouch glares at him with a manic hatred. Its so intense Harry pulls out his thesaurus from another pocket just to find another word to describe his hatred more aptly.

"Hmm... Enmity. Sounds about right." He mutters to himself before pocketing his books.

Crouch is shaking when he looks back up, hand tightly grasped around his wand, "You've ruined /everything/, boy!"

It's then that that enmity is put to use and Harry finds himself having to dodge a few unforgivables.

*** Bonus (and holy crap this is waaaaaaaaay longer than I expected it to be):

"Harry?" Dumbledore asks.

"Yes, Professor?"

They are in the infirmary, where Harry lies in bed, nursing a handful of minor injuries and exhausted from a few cruitiatus curses.

Dumbledore looks around the room for anyone else, before turning back to his student with a twinkle in his eyes. He grabs a bag from his pockets and opens it up.

"Would you like a lemon drop? I know how terrible those potions can be. As helpful as they are they leave the worst after taste."

The teen grabs the bag, giving the headmaster a grateful nod, then popping one of the candies into his mouth.

They sit in silence for a while before the professor speaks up again, "You know... Harry, I think what you've done is much much more than anyone could have possibly realized at first."

Harry arches one eyebrow, "What do you mean?"

"If I am correct, then your obsession with grammar may have just rediscovered an ancient peice of magic. You see, I've looked over the contract myself this morning, and realized just what /loose/ implies here."

Harry grabs another candy.

Dumbledore looks thoughtful, "It's possible that the Triwizard tournament was originally a ritual. Designed to strengthen magic by testing who needed it most. It was used to determine who had the most potential but also had a poor connection with their magic. The goblet could /loosen/ whatever was binding that connection and allow that wizard or witch to use their magic more freely. But only if they weren't able to compete to their fullest."

"That sounds about right. I did see something in the contact about strengthening magic, but that was only at the very beginning."

"You're right. It seems as though the tournament lost its true meaning centuries ago in favor of boisterous shows of power. But... It does have me wondering..."

"Sir?"

"Hmm? Oh... Nothing." But the mischievous glint in the headmasters eyes said otherwise, "I just think an old friend of mine may have benefited greatly from your discovery."

"I'll see you later, Harry. Rest up."

"Ok then. Thanks for the lemon drops."

"It was my pleasure."

The Headmaster leaves and Harry turns to the multiple get well gifts left on his bedside table. He picks up a book Hermione left for him on regional English slang in the 1800s and starts reading.

[] [] [] [] [] [] [] [] [] [] [] [] [] [] [] [] [] [] [] [] [] [] [] [] [] [] []

"Filch seems rather happy." Dumbledore remarks.

"Filch seems happy." Harry echoes, eyes wide.

In front of hundreds of people, the caretaker of Hogwarts faces off a dragon with newly loosened magic and the /happiest/ look Harry has ever seen.

No. That's not the right word. Happy is much too sane for what Filch is right now.

Harry pulls out his pocket dictionary and thesaurus, flipping through the pages until he's sure he's found the right words.

/Gleefully deranged./

That sounds more like it.

**** First of, I really like the piece you wrote, especially that Harry doesn´t read up on the contract just for the prompt, but the interest in language and grammer is part of his characterization throughout the piece.

However, as this is a thread about grammar, I have to point out that your use of german is a bit off. The correct cases for Junge (= boy) would be 'unverschämter, idiotischer'and the sentence in general does not sound natural to a native speaker. But that might be explained by Karkaroff /not/ being a native speaker.

Otherwise very well done, and thank you for this amusing short story!

It would be awesome if Dumbledore recognizes this and remembers that riddle was a great student of magic but had lousy comprehension and writing skills due to poor primary education in his stay at the orphanage. This eventually leads to Dumbledore and harry going through all the possible rituals that riddle could have used to find all the drawbacks that he missed.

** Do it as there being an actual written contract, but due to the fact that we never see a single English class being taught at Hogwarts (and there don't seem to be Wizarding primary schools) it contains spelling/grammar errors that alter the meaning in key places.

On the other hand, standardized spelling is a fairly new concept (at least for English, dunno about other languages), so intent might override misspellings. Conversely, maybe they're /more/ fastidious about spelling because when you misspell a runic script /bad things happen./..

** Unfortunately for Bartemius Crouch, Harry was also tired of being told what to do by adults whose sense of responsibility was as sharp as Neville's skill in potions. Added to this misfortune was the fact that students of Gryfinndor House were competing with the Slytherins to be the most foul mouthed students in school. So Crouch was taken by surprise when Harry burst out.

"You stupid retarded piece of Hippogriff dung! ," yelled Harry Potter, his voice somewhere between a man's baritone and a woman's high octave, "You're full of dung you.. you /shit/!! This isn't the c*ks*king Daily Prophet sweepstakes you turdnugget. I know as much about advanced magic as this d*kwad Snape here knows about hair care. So last year it was /'no Harry, you keep your head down Harry'/ and now its 'get out and risk your neck Harry?' Yeah, f*k this sh*t!"

"Potter!" snarled Severus Snape, his face absolutely livid. "This time you've gone too far!"
