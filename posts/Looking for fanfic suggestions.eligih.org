although ao3 is my preferred website, i fear i have read almost everything that appeals to me there. as such, i am in search of new fanfics. i'm not really all that picky, there's few pairings i dislike reading about (such as harry/hermione, harry/ginny, any of the trio with severus or voldemort). i rather like time-travelling, reincarnation, master of death!harry and crossovers with got. i don't particularly care for fem!harry, but i'd like to avoid it. thanks anyway!


** Try linkffn(Fate by TheTrueSpartan) I am pretty sure it's only available on Fanfiction.net

*** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13170637/1/][*/Fate/*]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/11323222/TheTrueSpartan][/TheTrueSpartan/]]

#+begin_quote
  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Char bashing, no Mary Sues.

**** No problem, I am pretty proud of that Fic for some reason. I guess because I read it from the early days. There's a part around Chapter 50 that's a bit of boring stuff. I stopped reading there when it was being posted but others have said that it picks back up quickly enough so don't give up.

***** i know what you mean, i finished it today and there were definitely come bits that i thought could be improved, but i loved the overall feeling of the fanfic. i also love that trope of slytherin house politics.
