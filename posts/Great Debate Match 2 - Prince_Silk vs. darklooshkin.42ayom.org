** AGAINST:

As an opening statement, I wish first to address one thing that every fanfiction writer is grateful for-namely JK Rowling's devotion to expanding the Harry Potter universe we all know and love.

JK Rowling has, to date, published seven books, helped bring about eight movies, penned three additional books (fantastic beasts and where to find them, Quidditch through the ages and The Tales of Beedle the Bard), helped build the Pottermore website and wrote a short story serving as prequel to the book series, all based around the Harry Potter universe. She has also helped with another movie we are all awaiting the release of with bated breath.

In short, she has written a lot of material covering the Hp 'verse and helped flesh it out even more for fans and beginning readers alike. All the material she releases officially has been planned out for years, often finalised long before she finished penning the story the details she gives are related to.

Her word, as far as the community of avid Harry Potter fans and dabblers alike is concerned, is practically law.

This, however, does not necessarily mean that it should be canon. When JK Rowling answers questions in interviews related to this or that character, this or that background event and this or that detail regarding such and such artefact/historical event/notable figure in the wizarding world, she does so willingly and often in sufficient detail for it to be useful to readers looking to fill in the gaps.

However, she doesn't necessarily need to do this at all. The Pottermore website, for instance, provides her with a means through which to answer such questions in an official and assumedly permanent matter.

In short, she has means through which to make any answer she wants to canonise readily available. If she chooses not to do so, that leaves room for modification pending final canonization.

Which is what I base my answer upon-as an avid writer, JK Rowling has published a great amount of source material already. The seven books, the three supplementals, the short story and whatever else gets published on the matter /are/ unquestionably canon. The movies and other joint ventures she embarks upon with outside sources are of questionable canonicity until she declares them to be canon and true to the vision of the source material. The Pottermore website falls under such a category-as long as she signs off on the contents, it is canon. Statements made regarding the series, answers given to questions in interviews and details given in general conversation however are an entirely different matter. While they may be part of the public record, until they are slotted into one of the official outlets through which JKR adds to the general body of work already in existence, its validity is fluid and, as such, cannot be considered canon until it's included in something somewhere.

TL;DR: If it ain't written down and given the stamp of approval by Her, it ain't canon. This covers her statements too-until it's officially included in the continuity and signed off on by her, it's not canon.
