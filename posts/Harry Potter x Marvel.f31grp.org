I am looking for any fanfics that have Harry joining the Avengers or something similar. As long as it is well written I am good. I really enjoyed The Stark Truth by- misteeirene - Harry Potter - Fandom [Archive of Our Own] [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2549801/chapters/5668883]]

#+begin_quote
  The world is breaking. War and technology push on the edge of the unbelievable as S.H.I.E.L.D. desperately tries to keep the peace. Soldier and scientist no longer hold the line alone, as an ancient fire burns alongside them. The last of all wizards.

It's abandoned right where things are starting to really get good. Unless you want to waste your time on a story that will never be finished, I'd steer clear.

****** Idk, I've been reading fanfics for so long that I've learned to just enjoy the journey and accept that there won't be a conclusion. So many great and well-written fics are unfinished. This one in particular is prob the best in this cross over and I think it has enough content to warrant a read.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8410168/1/][Steve and the Barkeep]] where Harry is MoD and owns a bar in New York

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12775029/1/][The Safehouse]] is a slash fic where Harry is Hawkeyes family instead of his wife. Written kind of poorly but it's cute

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8148717/1/][Finding Home]] MoD Harry is not aging, and ends up in New York befriending Tony Stark.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10177155/1/][Tricksters and Gods]] where Loki's punishment is to be sent to Midgard as a human, and ends up in the body of one Harry Potter without his memories, but still the personality

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11537017/1/][One Soldier, Two]] is where a FemHarry ends up in an alternate universe in the middle of WW2. Bucky/FemHarry

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4148136/chapters/9358017][Of Wizards and Heroes]] MoD Harry lives long enough to be transported to another dimension where he meets the Avengers and Loki. slash

  Loki's in for it now. Odin has had enough and has banished him to Earth to relearn some lessons. Too bad he hadn't paid attention to where Loki ended up. Now Harry Potter, the Boy-Who-Lived, has to deal with memories that aren't his own while he gets his revenge on those who sought to use him as a weapon. Can Harry regain what he lost, or will his past self take control first?

  Centuries after that fatal day of the battle of Hogwarts, Harry Potter has fallen into legend, a bedtime story parents tell their children, a name whispered around campfires. He wanders the world alone and immortal, until one single reckless moment sends him hurtling into a parallel dimension of heroes and villains. A new enemy arises from an ancient power, and Harry must take a stand as the last wizard to protect this new world. If only SHIELD would stop trying to track him down...and someone could explain what the hell was an 'Avenger' was supposed to be. Honestly, muggles...

  Dragged from her new home to yet another universe, Kara Zor-L, Power-Girl, finds herself in a world without superheros or heroines. The only truly 'super' being left, she's in a world of greys and blacks with only the help of a wiseass wizard to help her survive her greatest challenge yet... Chicago

  Once, Thor was James Potter, New Mexico being a refinement of Odin's technique (being murdered didn't do Thor's sanity any favours). After a decade, a mostly reformed Loki restores his memories, introducing Thor's son, Harry, to new family and friends. But soon, ancient secrets emerge along with enemies both old and new as darkness rises. Harry is left with a choice: Fight or Die.
