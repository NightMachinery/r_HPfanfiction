** So glad to hear those fanfics participate in Request thread bashing...

Rule */8/* is "No */direct/* links to sexual or suggestive content involving minors." so if I link a chapter without smut in it, that doesn't actually break the rule. :P

I will say if blindness is on this list A LOT of fics thrown around here are probably not okay. I think this is a fool's errand, and not one I will be participating in.

I understand where you are coming from, but don't think this is a good use of anyone's time. You won't get everything, so you really are just adding fics to a "these are a bit more inconvenient to find" list.

The official Reddit rule is broad enough that almost anything with a T rating or above technically breaks it.

Unless the admins start to crack down, it's not even important to do. There are tons of subreddits that have content that in some way breaks this rule, including a lot of rule 34 and things like [[/r/gonewildaudio]]. The admins obviously do not care unless it's depicting actual minors and maybe subreddits that are dedicated exclusively to extreme underage hentai.

** This. This right here is why Reddit's sitewide rule is stupid. When it was first put up, it was going to be "We are blocking things like jailbait and explicit child porn". Clearly cut and dry, no-one would have any objection to that right?

You know what would be a good and interesting way to explore magic? Do a freaky friday situation, and then explore why Kid!AdultBody in a sexually tense situation is funny and comedy, but Adult!KidBody is to risky to put to film. (which, BTW, I think is massively *#$* up) Or how about exploring what it would mean to live hundreds of years, do you stretch out puberty longer?

Or if you want to explore a society that retains some older social norms. Or maybe spells/potions that allow instant aging. Or how about someone who got transformed and lived their whole life as a dog?

​

Or I know, someone who has been magically stuck in the body of a baby for the last 18 years.

And this is exactly why every time Congress passes a law to outlaw this (which they do regularly), it always gets struck down as unconstitutional. Sadly, Reddit has a right to censor their playground. Boo.

Idk why people ITT are so mad about the rule. The mods didn't come up with it, this is all on the Reddit T&C. "Fantasy imagery involving sexualized minors" is their rule.

And if you want to use Reddit, then Reddit gets to set the rules. Same for Ao3/FFN deleting songfics and fics that follow the "X Reads the Books" format, regardless of how much we personally like reading them.

Because Reddit doesn't care about enforcing this rule, it's only there and so broad so if an issue comes up they can do something. It's not there for things like this sub. The admins blatantly do not care about things like this, rule 34, roleplay, etc.

It's like ffn's rule against explicit sex. They obviously don't care, so trying to enforce it here by banning linking any story hosted on ffn that has explicit sex is just wasting time and a pain in the ass.

***** Instead of arguing about the list, how about just refraining from linking fics or using FFNBot that have sex scenes with young teenage characters? If you're unsure about "what counts", fall on the side of caution. Some fics may pass through, but some fics are blatant rule breakers that can't be argued as a "maybe". One from the list (Anti-Heroine) /does/ has explicit sex scenes set in Third Year and before.

The excessiveness is due to Reddit's blanket wording in their T&C. You have to remember that Reddit doesn't care about free speech or the users. They're a corporation who want to make themselves appealing to sponsors and advertisers, the same as YouTube and their shifting content guidelines over the past few years.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

I mean sure, usually. However, that doesn't mean there might be something interesting to explore here.

It all comes down to if you prefer your rules so that it lets a hundred gulties by so it doesn't catch an innocent, or that it block a hundred innocents in order for it to catch that one guilty. Reddit chose the second (and made a very broadly construed rule), which I think is a fair decision to criticize.

#+begin_quote
  ??? how is that not bad.
#+end_quote

Maybe I was assuming enough imagination to see how those plots could result in interesting situations worth visiting. It doesn't matter if 90% of it is just a poorly written trash excuse for trash. If it is written well exploring an interesting topic, is there something interesting there.

So let me give you a concrete example of how real world censorship rules lead to damage. There is a sci-fi series I know that imagined a life extending technology that halved biological aging, but had to be giving at birth. It explores some of interacting with those without the treatment, like how strange it is that the young person leading the troops is not a up and coming commander but actually older.

It always shyied away from discussing the implications of being 30 and looking like a kid due to this issue. And that is a shame, as the author explored some of the other interesting problems and pitfalls related to such a technology.

And that was with the US's rules, which are tightly targeted and certainly err on the side of caution.

So yes, I thing a overbroad rule on this subject does more harm than good. Reddit could have adopted a narrower rule that blocked all illegal content and the very worst offenders without risking blocking good content, but they chose to go with a broad rule that will cover all objectionable content at the cost of also covering some items with real value.

** You do realize that by creating a list you're indirectly promoting those stories as a sexualization of minors, right? Someone that actively looking for that kind of content will be glad because we did most of the job already. Searching for the actual content isn't hard if you already has the title and author. This is following the reddit policy by the word, not the spirit.

Are we following the US age of consent or the UK? I didn't see it on [[https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/do-not-post-sexual-or-suggestive][reddit site policy]]. Some user pointed out [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/abnlpf/book_club_january_2019_blindness_swung_by_serafim/][here]] that reddit follow US age of consent, but do we have an actual confirmation from reddit instead of a word of some random user?

I think including Blindness on the list is stupid.

1. It's not explicit, the scene fade to black before anything happened. There's no description of the act involved and there's no description of their sexual organ. (AFAIK, let me know if I'm wrong). If you want to ban all stories where teenagers make out, good luck.
2. (I think) they're 17, older than the age of consent in the world. Technically a minor in some part of the US but both are mature enough to have sex, especially that Harry and Hermione are described as geniuses in this story.
3. It's a coming of age story, and sex is a part of growing up. I'm not saying all teenagers must have sex, but it happened, deal with it. IMHO, Blindness doesn't fetishized underage sex, it only show that it happened without making it ambiguous.

On that note, why are we only following reddit rule on minor sexualization while ignoring [[https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/do-not-post-violent-content][the site-wide rule on violence]]?

​

Edit: I'm not saying the rule should be removed, but making a list is stupid.

Also, what do you mean "objective vision like with violence"? I didn't get that.

** Thanks for this thread, Mods.

This is a response to a [[https://old.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/dbjguo/stop_recommending_princess_of_the_blacks_please/][past thread]] on recommendations of "Princess of the Blacks". There were defenses in the thread itself, from people who enjoyed the fic and explained how it didn't depict explicit sexual content involving minors.

[[https://old.reddit.com/rules/][Reddit's sitewide rules state:]]

#+begin_quote
  Reddit prohibits any sexual or suggestive content involving minors or someone who appears to be a minor.

  This includes child sexual abuse imagery, child pornography, and any other content, *including fantasy content (e.g. stories,* “loli”/anime cartoons), that *depicts,* encourages, or promotes pedophilia, *child sexual exploitation,* or otherwise sexualizes minors or someone who appears to be a minor. Depending on the context, this can in some cases include depictions of minors that are fully clothed and not engaged in overtly sexual acts.

  If you are unsure about a piece of content involving a minor or someone who appears to be a minor, do not post it.
#+end_quote

The rule in this sub against this type of content is not because some people are snowflakes and are offended by it. It's not a personal attack against anyone's tastes. The rule in this sub is because Reddit has content guidelines and have shut down a number of subs that broke them, and even ones that didn't, as long as they caught media attention in the wrong kind of way, eg, WatchPeopleDie. Reddit doesn't care about free speech, the users, or being your friend. They're a corporation who want to make themselves appealing to sponsors and advertisers.

Enjoy what you like, but be mindful of what you post and link. That's all.

** Thanks for this initiative. The fact that its necessary at all says more than enough. I'm appalled at the reactions in this thread (some usual suspects in here as well). People need to realise that the amount of underage sex in this fandom is not normal or acceptable. Yes, teens have sex, and yes, it features in literature. But the fetishization of children in this fandom is rampant and it needs to stop.

#+end_quote

No one in this thread is arguing against that. There are fics in this fandom that depict sexual content with children, and everyone here probably agrees that is not ok. But most people roll their eyes when the rule is broadened to also ban consentual scenes between seventeen year-olds, because teenage promiscuity is actually fairly mainstream both in real life as well as depicted on screen and in books. Courts in real life don't waste their time trying to prosecute those depictions as if they were as reprehensible as the /true/ cases of pedophile media.

Obviously Reddit is free to define the word "minors" however they want since this is their platform. The mods are being cautious by defining the term as broadly as possible to avoid even the slightest possibility of a crackdown from the site admins. Thus, the mods consider it irrelevant that 17 years old is the age of adulthood in the Harry Potter series. Instead, they base their judgements on the age of adulthood in the majority of the USA where Reddit is based (age 18).

The problem lies in that it's pointless to try to enforce a rule in a way that is not supported by the majority of a population, especially when the methods available cannot provide consistent, full coverage enforcement. Attempting to do so doesn't lead to better compliance, instead it leads to more widespread disrespect for the rules and more deliberate rule breaking.

*** And the rule isn't even saying that you can't read them or talk about them, just /don't link them here./

I have read fanfics from many other fandom communities and none of them were this upset about protecting their underage content in the wake of Reddit changing their T&C or Google changing their ad revenue algorithms. Even Spacebattles, a hive of armchair RaTionALiSt wankery, accepted rule changes about sub-16 content on their site.

That easily explains why that community didn't complain about the rule: That's a definition of "minors" that everyone can get behind. The mods of this sub would see more happy compliance if they chose a similarly sensible cutoff point.

This whole debacle was started by [[https://old.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/dbjguo/stop_recommending_princess_of_the_blacks_please/][this thread]], which involved a fic with child brothels. There were still defenders because the author didn't write explicit sexual scenes with children.

#+begin_quote
  "They mention that she was coerced into becoming a child prostitute, insinuate things happened, but there is no explicit content involving kids.... I get what you're saying, but even with Narcissa, the most that's mentioned is she used to dress up as a serving girl and wait on her during her "visits". I think the author was very careful about not blatantly talking about what was happening."
#+end_quote

I'm presuming that the mods are using a blanket rule to avoid quibbling with definitions of how "explicit" is explicit. Though I do agree, a clear age cut-off would have been helpful - even though the idea of an age cut-off date is as discomfiting as those birthday countdown websites for Emma Watson or Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen.

****** I saw that thread when it was active, and it was a bit of an eye opener because I didn't realize how many people on this sub routinely recommend blatantly rule-breaking fics.

When I said "more happy compliance" I meant that it would be a rule that the majority of the sub would support. Obviously, judging by that thread and a few others I've seen, there are a few oddballs who would want the cut-off age to be even lower, but from what I've read the majority would be happy with using the age of adulthood in the Harry Potter series as a sensible limit.

**** I don't see anything explicitly on Spacebattles Bout that. However, Spacebattles bans all NSFW content. For that, you usually see links to Questionable Questing.

QQ required all NSFW content to be begging a login filter and limits illegal content. Including child porn. Also beastiality. Although "Text is still permitted."

***** From their [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-rules-of-spacebattles-the-rules-of-rp-q-and-resources-aka-cleanup.706327/][rules page]]:

- No explicit sex acts or lurid prose. Sex is not something to show directly, since SB isn't a porn board. The most you can show is kissing/petting -> fade to black

- Stories focusing primarily on sex are out, as are stories that are blatant fetish fiction.

- No going into great detail describing those underage teen bodies. Again, no lurid prose.

They don't just ban explicit content, but sexualized physical descriptions of teenagers. Harry and Ron discussing how Hermione was suddenly sexy looking at the Yule Ball would probs get a fic banned off Spacebattles, even if there is zero sex. Or best case scenario, locked and hidden until the offending line was removed and passed mod inspection.
