I'm not talking /Gary Stu/s; I'm asking if there are any stories where his core is too huge, his power level makes scouters explode, and where he's a walking disaster area because of his uncontrollably massive might? I want a fanfic where Harry unintentionally hurts someone or destroys something important because of his power, and which has real consequences that the author doesn't just gloss over.

Alternatively, I'll accept Political!Harry that gets backed into a corner/backstabbed by people who are trying to take him down a peg.

** Linkffn(The Merging by Shaydrall) has a really good take on the "What if Harry got Kissed by a Dementor?" trope imo. It's also got some of the best characterization I've seen, and even has some funny snark moments with Harry. Hell, a lot of my favorite underused characters get a few limelight moments. (Warning for underage (older woman) somewhere in the middle of ch14, but it's fade-to-black)

25 chapters so far, and long ones at that, but in a good way. Other than the quotes in the beginning and the author's notes at the end of the chapters, I'd think I was actually reading a book.
