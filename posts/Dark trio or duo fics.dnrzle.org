I saw a really, really interesting idea for a fic the other day- it was essentially the trio is just fed up with all the injustices of the magical world and each individually decides they're gonna fuck it up! I guess in the end they would've joined together but I wouldn't know because IT ONLY HAD 4K WORDS AND HADNT UPDATED SINCE EARLY 2018. At least 30k fanfics are preferred, I'm tired of having my heart broken. Preferably no ships, but it's fine if romance isn't the main plot.


** I can never get the BOT to work so here you are. The series is called Eyes,Bodies, and Potions by TheMadHatterOfficial. It has dark!Trio featured and is 3 stories deep in the series. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17347349/chapters/40814720]]

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.
