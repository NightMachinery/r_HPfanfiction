:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for a fic that has a girl at the ministry in the future who is tasked with interviewing Harry Potter, but most of the stories about him were written by the weaslys In order to make them seem important and there's a joke that Harry killed Voldemort while he was “ enjoying himself” that's all I can remember off the top of my head
