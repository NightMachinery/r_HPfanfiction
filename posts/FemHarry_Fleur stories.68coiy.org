** There's I Know Your Secret. Harry's a girl hiding as a boy. It's not very good, but it's the only fem!Harry/Fleur story I know.

  AU 4th year! Fairytale is the company our hero builds to fight the lies of the magical UK. Bringing out the Frontier paper to begin fighting back. The balance jumps as Voldemort tries to return. Dumbledore & the ministry try to control Hogwarts & take it after being 'expelled'. Hope will build the Unified Mystical Commonwealth to be independent from magical UK.
