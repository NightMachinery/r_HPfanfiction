** You know...I have actually never seen this, even though I think some people should have written about it already. I think people have an aversion to making him just another death eater, so they try to make him a special snowflake. Someone should get on this and write about it, because so far it's pretty unexplored territory and it could be plausible if Neville was the BWL.
