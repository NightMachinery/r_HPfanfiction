In many fics, to receive the dark mark, one usually has to kill or rape someone (a muggle)

Am i the only one who thinks this contradicts Half Blood Prince and makes no sense?

Like one of the biggest plots of the book is how Voldemort gave Draco the mission to kill Dumbledore, and how Draco couldn't do it because he isn't a killer and hasn't killed anyone before. His family, Snape, and Dumbledore constantly talk about it and none of them want him to become a murderer and ruin his soul.

Yet at the same time, he already has the dark mark by the start of the year.


** I haven't seen much of that in fic myself but it probably just comes from initiation being a common aspect of violent groups in real life.

I agree with you. Voldemort gives Draco the mark and then tasks him to kill Dumbledore. He intended for Draco to fail as a way to punish Lucius, and the mark seems to be a pretext for Voldemort to give Draco orders he needs to carry out. Some people seem to believe that you need to earn the mark before receiving it when HBP shows us the opposite with Draco.

I think people forget that while the mark might be considered an honor among Death Eaters, there is no indication that Voldemort truly considers it an honor to bestow it on someone. He treats his followers with contempt: look at how he mocks Bellatrix in DH after she has displeased him enough and she was arguably his favorite. He doesn't see anyone as worthy. Voldemort clearly despises the Malfoys in DH, and since he expected Draco to fail in killing Dumbledore from the beginning, he never intended for Draco to be someone "worthy" even though he intended for Draco to be marked. Wormtail has a dark mark too, and Voldemort considers him dirt.

Bestowing the mark has practical purposes: it allows Voldemort to summon someone and causes them pain if they ignore the summons. That's canon. I have no problem with fanfic writers who want to take creative liberties with their stories, which is fun for fanfics, but it's annoying when people will insist fanon is canon just because they've read several fics with an idea and liked it. That's not how canon works; if it's not in the books, then it's fanon. The idea of Death Eaters being initiated through a set of trials or tasks and then being marked upon succeeding in them is fanfiction only.

*** It always made me scratch my head how the Death Eaters seemed to think Voldemort would bring about some pureblood golden age, or something (at least in fanfics and at least the first time around). I'd love to see a fic where someone points out to their face that Voldemort basically treats them like cattle. I mean, he brands them, is willing to kill and/or torture them for any number of reasons, and has absolutely zero respect for any of them. So, /worse/ than cattle actually.

Like there's clearly a disconnect between the haughty racists he attracted at the beginning and the, honestly, straight-up thugs that we see do the dirty work towards the end of canon when he's ruling solely through fear.

Canon hints at how handsome and charismatic he used to be too, but then spends a lot of time making him rabid animal-scary instead of calculated-scary.

There's actually several real life sociopaths/psychopaths who are absolute lunatics, murderous as all get out or a combination, but they manage to project a front that makes them look like decent folks or have enough charisma to attract a crowd. Ted Bundy and Charles Manson to name but two potential influences on what past Voldemort was like.

****** I always thought of Voldemort as the Femme Fatale type without the seduction part. How he has his Death Eaters so wrapped around his finger is a mystery but probably he was indeed the sly charismatic manipulator. However in GoF he seems to be switching really quickly from nice to cruel. He calls the Death Eaters his "real family" and then proceeds to torture them. He lets Wormtail suffer than gives him a silver hand. Also when Wormtail is upset that Voldemort doesn't appreciate the fact that he returned, he promises him a task so important that most of the people would give a hand for without telling him what but visibly making him happy. Of course, because of his power over the Death Eaters, he no longer needs to play nice with them but he is still pretty charming when he wants to be.

**** I think we're supposed to have the impression that Voldemort's strategy after being reborn in GoF (using the Cruciatus left and right) is not the same strategy he employed to recruit hundreds of followers in the first Voldemort wizarding war. Like you said, it wouldn't make sense. In OoTP, Sirius says his parents:

#+begin_quote
  "...thought Voldemort had the right idea, they were all for the purification of the wizarding race, getting rid of Muggleborns and having pure-bloods in charge. They weren't alone, either, there were quite a few people, *before Voldemort showed his true colors*, who thought he had the right idea about things...they got cold feet when they saw what he was prepared to do to get power, though.
#+end_quote

​

Sirius also tells Harry that he's sure his parents were happy when Regulus joined the Death Eaters. Rowling puts Regulus one year behind Sirius in school. The Marauders graduate in 1978, so Regulus graduated in 1979. Assuming he joined right away, that means Voldemort didn't show his "true colors" until late in the war - late 1979 at least. To some extent, the Death Eaters were active before that since Regulus was collecting newspaper clippings about Voldemort, but it's hard to say how publicly violent they were and what the early rhetoric was like. We know Voldemort murdered in secret, like Myrtle and the Riddles, and maybe the bodies in the Inferi Cave. We know people were being murdered openly in 1981, like the McKinnons, the Prewett brothers, and Dorcas Meadowes. It's unknown when the exact transition was made.

In HBP and CoS, we see memories of young Tom Riddle being charming. We know he's able to groom Ginny through the diary. I wouldn't be surprised if Voldemort told his early followers exactly what they wanted to hear (capitalizing on pureblood prejudice against muggles and muggleborns). You're right that the dark mark is a brand, but I can imagine Voldemort convincing them that the dark mark was special (e.g. something like, the leaders of the new world will be those who carry my mark). After GoF, he isn't shown recruiting, so it makes sense the mask would drop. It's not necessary anymore.

I'd like to see more fics that don't assume Voldemort War 1 = Voldemort War 2.

I often think of the First Wizarding War as one fought mainly through propaganda with the violence openly erupting only toward the end. Not every pureblood wanted to drag muggles or muggleborns out into the town square and execute them, but certainly there were beliefs amongst them that there was a natural hierarchy based on blood purity.

Basically, Voldemord's true intention is crippling or outright destruction of pureblood society/culture. By essentially posing as someone who will bring them back power they want, he managed to get enough loyalist to use as a front line soldiers, untill they'd either win and he'd rule the new 'utopia' of purebloods despite he is a mere half-blood, or the whole lineages would collapse due to death tolls and there was no more purebloods to rule anything.

** If you think about it, it seems that overall the Deatheaters primarily go after muggles and muggleborns, except for those few cases where Voldemort is going after a "pureblood/blood traitor" enemy. So it's quite easy to imagine that young recruits are blooded/initiated against victims who really can't fight back - muggles and muggleborns.

So I can easily see Draco participating in the rape, torture, and murder of some faceless muggle/muggleborn in order to earn the mark. 1. he thinks they are less than dirt. 2. Since he most likely won't know them he won't be bothered by harming someone he knows (and canon has show us that he has very few qualms in hurting someone).

I don't see Draco's hesitation in killing Dumbledore in the tower to be because he can't kill, his previous attempts to kill Dumbledore proved he was willing. 1. he had no problem giving a cursed necklace to Katie Bell that almost killed her. 2. He had no trouble trying again with poisoned mead that almost killed Ron. 3. He had no trouble leading murderers into the school who would not have hesitated to kill any student they came across. (All reasons why I feel he should have been thrown into Azkaban or through the Veil instead of going free).

I believe his hesitation in the tower was he was going against a powerful wizard, one who Voldemort was supposed to fear. So that had him scared that he would lose. Eg in the back of his mind he was afraid that once he truly attacked Dumbledore with a curse to cause harm, Dumbledore would return fire and kill him. That's why he hesitated in the tower not because Draco couldn't kill.

Now JKR never told us what Deatheaters had to do to "earn" the right to become a Deatheater. And IRL we know that violent gangs often require violent acts (rape, murder, etc.) as initiations for new members so it's easy to imagine Voldemort to require that level of "dedication" from his new recruits.

** Agree with this. I think it comes from comparison with the Mafia, or irl gangs, that do require initiates to do some shady stuff and then even worse stuff (murder, rape etc) to become "trusted inner circle."

But I think the DEs are more comparable to a political movement than a gang- a political movement full of shitty people pretending to be respectable. Ultimately, gangs don't usually want political power. They may want /change/, but they don't usually look to overthrow the government and install someone of their choosing as ruler. For many gangs political power would be an anathema, as they pride themselves on their position outside the law and the establishment.

The DEs do do politics, they exist purely to get Voldemort into power. Think the original KKK (when they looked to overthrow state governments in the 1860s onwards), or the Nazi Party in the 1930s. Those groups were made up by a range of people many of whom had indeed committed atrocities, and the groups themselves often sanctioned atrocities. But it wasn't a prerequisite of joining. Both had, at the time, a veneer of respectability and many of their members were indeed respectable people. They were /political movements/, not /gangs./ Now, we all know especially with hindsight what bullshit that is and I for one would rather spend eternity with members of the Mafia than sit through one lunch with a member of the Nazi Party, but the hoops people will jump through mentally to make their racism, and their membership of a racist organisation, "socially acceptable" never ceases to amaze me. The DEs are like that- in the circles they move in its ok, even encouraged, to be a part of this thing. We just don't talk about the realities of it over dinner, because that would be /bad manners./ Think about it, what's Lucius Malfoy more likely to join- a "political" organisation that he gets to pretend is "civilised," or a gang known only for violence?

It's why the snatchers, and greyback and co, were never Marked. /They're/ the street gang, the thugs for hire. They do the dirty work, the likes of Malfoy earn and donate the Galleons that enable the DEs to pay said thugs to do their dirty work while they turn a blind eye and carry on pretending to be respectable. The inner circle, those bankrolling the whole thing, need plausible deniability. Making them commit on the record atrocities is the opposite of that.

********* I mean, it could, but still felt like a stretch. He was handed his arse to him at every turn in school. And we never get any indication of he getting more athletic or practising the more physical aspects of dueling. He could invent unusual spells with patience and slowly at an empty classroom, taking his time to harness the best possible outcome, and still be too slow for a duel against Sirius or Bellatrix.

That memory in OotP was a big thing because it was something that went way further then anything else, and Snape's reaction was accordingly extreme. Canon Snape and James went back and forth constantly, and even that is only mentioned in passing, by Hagrid I think?

** No you're not. It doesn't make sense. Voldemort marks someone, and then they are marked for life. No turning back. It's a loyalty tool. It gets what could have been someone who would regret doing horrible acts to feel like they have to commit.

Oh, you're a Death Eater who didn't commit atrocities? Does anyone care? You're marked. How are WE supposed to know who was forced and who was not? Also a form of protection, now the lieutenants are indistinguishable from the regretful rabble. Malfoy can play innocent despite the brand. Everyone was scared, after all.

Making someone commit an atrocity in order to obtain the mark would be immensely stupid.

*** But totally consistent with how real world criminal gangs act/initiate new members. In order to become a "made man" in the mafia you have to commit a contract killing. One it ensures you are not undercover law enforcement, two it provides blackmail against you leaving, eg we witnessed you killing Thompson. No matter how financially beneficial you may be. In order to truly be a made man you must kill someone.

The same is true of MS-13 gang members. In order to be a full fledged member of MS-13 you must kill someone (either a rival gang member or totally random).

So with examples like that it's easy to extrapolate the same activities for the Deatheaters. If you don't require that type of "commitment" then there is nothing to stop a new recruit who has not committed any atrocities from going to the DMLE and telling them everything he knows including the identity of all other marked Deatheaters. He may fear reprisal from the Deatheaters but he has no worries of punishment from the DMLE as he didn't commit any serious crimes.

However, if you require the new recruits to rape, torture, and murder in front of witnesses they will most likely hestitate going to law enforcement. Because now not only do they have to fear reprisal from the deatheaters, they now have to fear punishment for the violent crimes they committed.

Which is why real world violent criminal organizations make new members commit violent crimes in order to join.

**** I know the examples. This is different for a variety of reasons, mundane and magical.

1. This is a political struggle that is supposed to end with taking over the government. Going to the DMLE in a compromised government with nothing but a Dark Mark... far higher chances of reprisal because the stakes and abilities of the movement are much higher.
2. Masks/hoods. Nobody really knows who did what. Imperious as well. It would require you to fully commit to selling out everyone you know, and hope they pardon you. This only really happened after Voldemort's fall, because, see 1.
3. The commitment is to an ideology and Voldemort. The 'gang' is very much held together under the power of a single man who cannot be touched by the government. He's too powerful. Vs a gang in reality where there is a real possibility of the gang being arrested or at least you going into witness protection. Voldemort's power and abilities mean the government is incapable of doing this.

Voldemort is not afraid of betrayal. The DMLE knows who did it, and it's not a matter of evidence that they cannot arrest him. What he wants are people to commit to his side, and then others to be too afraid to oppose him. Demanding everyone murder to join lowers the willingness to take the dark mark. They should do it out of fear, not commitment. He can literally read their minds.

*** Showing that Death Eaters murder people is to make them more deplorable?

Pretty sure it's canon that Death Eaters murder people. Don't need to make shit up to bash Snape at all. Snape willingly joined a madman and an organization that wants to oppress/kill all muggleborns. Snape was already looking forward to joining said group at 16.

I'm sure the Death Eaters' only goal was to politely tell the muggleborns to go fuck themselves. They were so misunderstood.

*** Implying you have to bash Snape. In any fic where Harry puts emotions over logic (and that's the vast majority of them), canon is enough to put Snape third on his shit list, right after Voldemort and Bellatrix. If not ahead of Bellatrix. Snape is a deplorable character that the fandom /loves/ turning into a misunderstood hero, especially with that "Marauders bullied him into being a death eater" trope.

The only way to make Snape at all redeemable is to change his backstory starting a good twenty years before the first book. Otherwise, even Death Eater Harry should logically hate him.

** It's a logical assumption, given that death eaters are basically sadistic terrorists. Murder would demonstrate their intent to join and their crime would keep them from switching sides for fear of azkaban. IDK if it'd be canon but it definitely fits especially with the way everyone feared death eaters and the dark mark so fervently.

I think malfoys dark mark happened a little differently since his father was in azkaban. It served as both a replacement for his father's service and a warning to punish his family. I don't think he had earned it yet- another reason for his assignment to kill dumbledore.

** Its fanfiction. By definition canon can and will be changed. It works in certain stories when you want clear borders on good and bad sides. Anyone who joined the dark lord had to do terrible things and are all evil. Depending on the type of story this can be a good plot point or a lazy one. Or just good for lazy reading when you want a break from more complicated fics. Just cause canon contradicts it doesnt mean it cant be used in fandom.

** My headcanon is simply that the mark gives some guarantees to a life of rewards for voldemorts true allies - not the replaceable shmuck - who were looking for power as well. The inner circle are all young adult heirs/similar with a thirst for power. To be given the mark was probably presented as a token of trust from voldemort himself, to openly acknowledge how he saw their worth and valued them.

And I assume it's given after they had accomplished something for voldemort that a random shmuck could not.

Could be murder. Could be obtaining a ministry position. Could be a shit-ton of gold.

** I think it is done to show the evil that exists in the Death Eaters. And the most common things that people associate with evil are murder, rape and torture. So making it a prerequisite to obtaining the mark makes the reader believe that.

Additionally, it has become such a cliché due to its use over the years in a lot of fanfics that people simply put that description by default. And of course, it's Fanfiction, so it will deviate from canon, sometimes not at all and sometimes too much.
