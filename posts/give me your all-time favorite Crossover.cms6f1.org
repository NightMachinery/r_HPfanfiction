Preferably set in the HP 'verse. Slash is OK as long as there's no smut.

Mine is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11098283/1/The-Black-Prince][The Black Prince]]. The basic premise isn't original at all, but the writing is so good that it feels one of a kind. Pity it's been abandoned.

linffn(11098283)


** linkffn(The Shadow of Angmar)

Best Lotr crossover, I would have expected it to already be recommended.

  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

** Linkffn(10784770) by far the best Mass Effect crossover out there imo.

Linkffn(8551180) Part 1 of a trilogy. Not a crossover itself, but it sets the scene for part two which goes into Stargate and part three which goes into Mass Effect.

Linkffn(4753440) Actually the same situation as above, not a crossover itself, but part two goes into Star Trek:NG while part 3 goes into Star Wars.

Linkffn(11157943) Star Wars crossover, sadly seems to be abandoned.

Linkffn(11577249) Star Wars crossover, also one of my all time favorites. Its great.

Linkffn(9586702) is always great, but it is fuckin long at 1m words, and has a sequel in progress.

Thought about adding "Browncoat, Green Eyes" to this, but you surely know about that masterpiece.

** I have two favorite crossovers. One of them, Shadow of Angmar, has already been discussed.

Instead, let's discuss linkffn(Cursebreaking Hamunaptra by Zenzao). This is a Harry Potter/The Mummy (1999) fusion starring a post-divorce Bill Weasley. This hasn't been updated in three years, two months and three days. There are four chapters, and FFN lists it as being 8,441 words. When you put this all together, you'd think "oh, died about because it had nothing going on." That would be an incorrect assumption. This is a well-written story, which does more with 8,441 words (approximately 588 of which aren't actually story but essentially author's notes) than stories with over 200k words. Each word feels deliberately placed, backstory and exposition are beautifully woven in. The fusion is handled with more grace than I would ever expect for a Harry Potter and adventure movie that didn't age super well. The magic is outstanding. I can't say enough good things about this fic. It's less than 10k, you have no excuse not to give it at least one read.

  After Tony Stark outs himself as Iron Man on live television, he acquires a magical stalker in the form of a bored (female) Harry Potter, who has emerged from the Veil of Death in a world without wizards. A cat-and-mouse game ensues when Stark's curiosity drives him to ever-increasing lengths to capture his invisible benefactor, who struggles with maintaining her distance.

  Harry Potter finds himself, and his normal bi-polar luck, pulled out of a quiet retirement and into the limelight of the 23rd century. He finds a grand new stage upon which his 'saving-people-thing' can act, and before he can say no, is pulled into the middle of a galaxy-spanning conflict. Rated 'M' for bad words and ideas, re-worked and re-posted. Enjoy.

** Harry Potter and the Natural 20 has already been recced, I see....

I like The Room With A Computer, which is a crossover with the X-Men movieverse and has Cyclops as the Muggle Studies teacher. It's a pretty low-key fic, not too much happening... but totally worth it for the character interactions, AND for the epilogue where Arthur Weasley gets a ride in the X-Jet and is just as ecstatic about it as you'd expect. linkffn(13243910)

Also have a soft spot for the Son of the Archer series, a crossover with the MCU where Ron is kidnapped by Death Eaters as a baby, and then rescued by Clint "Hawkeye" Barton, who ends up adopting him. I really like that someone OTHER than Harry got the "raised by crossover character" treatment here... and Tony Stark gets some really funny dialogue, especially in the third story. linkffn(11230962; 11884262; 12796500)

Never got into the Shadow of Angmar, and my fave LOTR crossover, Not Quite A Maia, seems to have been purged from the internet... but I did enjoy Back to the Beginning. It's Fem!Harry... SORT of. Harry's the reincarnation of Nurundil, the companion of Namo, and after having lived out his canon life finds himself in Middle-Earth shortly before of the War of the Ring, in the very female body of Nurundil but with the memories of Harry. linkffn(10131514)

  Harry Potter is done with life. He did everything and all he wanted was to pass on to the next great adventure. Sadly, rules get in the way of this and he must now find a new way to keep living.
