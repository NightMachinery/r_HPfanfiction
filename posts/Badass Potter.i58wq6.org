Looking for fics where harry is extremely badass. Also would like some recommendations where harry kills the death eaters and snape bashing included. Currently the best stories I found containing these things are from Kb0 on fanfic.net


** Try Stepping Back by TheBlack'sResurgence. It's a Harry time travel fic with Harry getting with a teenage Bella. You also might want to try the same author's first story called Honor Thy Blood (no time travel Harry/Daphne). (He's actually writing a remastered version as well.)

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.
