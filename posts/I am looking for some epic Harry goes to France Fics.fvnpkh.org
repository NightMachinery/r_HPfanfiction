** I admit, I don't quite understand what exactly you're looking for, but if it's an Epic in which an Epic Harry goes to France, then Wastelands of Time is a pretty good one.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4068153/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Wastelands-of-Time]]

It's basically Harry Potter in name only, since you could just change the names of the characters and the spells they shout and it'd be completely different, but it's fun enough. It's also only intermittently in France, but he does spend awhile there and big things happen.

If you're looking for a fic which takes place wholly in France and either France or Harry is epic during, I got nothin' - sorry.
