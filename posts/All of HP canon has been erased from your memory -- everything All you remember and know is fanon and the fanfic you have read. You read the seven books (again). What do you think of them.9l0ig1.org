I know that this will differ from person to person, as no-one has read the same fanfiction or has the same know-how of fanon. If you were to read canon for the first time, with absolutely no knowledge of it, what would you think of it?

** Remus marries a WOMAN?! Sirius DIES?! Tonks dies OFFSCREEN and we rarely see her in action at all?!

On a broader note, I actually think coming from fanon, canon would feel really mean to Harry. Everything goes bad for that kid until he's an adult really, and then he has all the combined and compound trauma to deal with. Of course JKR had Doylist reasons for doing that, but still, sheesh. I feel like a lot of fanon gives him more tools or balance to deal with his situation or certain aspects of it, unless it's an overblown grimdark AU.

** This is kinda me, since I've been reading a ton of Harry Potter fanfiction without watching / reading the Canon. Its kind of hard to get into because I already know what happens, but I like how the first chapters have a lot of childlike wonder the fanfics are missing, which is great. But it also feels so empty, like reading a summary, because fanfics like to cram so many details in.

**** It's mostly because of my short attention span. Books, you need to go to libraries or bookstores to find stuff you like, and while they're organized by genres they aren't really... Tagged? If I want to find stuff like time travel or soulmates or magic it's really hard unless I google. Fanfics are tagged, so you know exactly what you're getting into before getting into the time sink of reading. The review section is literally a click away to skim if this is a good read or not. Plus, since fanfics generally assume that you know what's going on, they tend to go straight to the point instead of giving me exposition about the world. Then if I grow attached to these characters, boom I can just click on the tags of the fic and look for similar stories with the same characters in an instant. Books, unless the fandom is huge, I'd get attached to the characters but then never see them again, and it's kind of sad.

... That said, I don't recommend reading fanfics before the Canon. My friends get really mad when I do that.

Canon Harry is a flobberworm. He wants to be an Auror because a Death Eater gave him the idea. After the war he starts working for the Ministry, the same ministry that worked so hard against him, a ministry that at best is merely corrupt and incompetent.

Why did Hermione marry Ron after years of ridicule because she did homework and wanted to learn something? Opposites may attract, but that's just ridiculous. They have /nothing/ in common except Harry as a friend. The fact that they bicker like an old couple is not a good thing, it means that marriage is doomed to fail.
