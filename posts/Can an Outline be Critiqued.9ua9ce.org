Basically it's like the title says. I have an outline for a fanfic that I really would like someone to read over. I need to apply fresh eyes and minds to it, people outside of myself to ask the questions that I might not think to answer on my own. So are there any volunteers?

Edit: On second though, I'm just going to put the link here. Thanks you again to everyone that I PMed. [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WHXQGHBHWPzEaSDHVYDaVtzCZBPtE2d9piz7HQzAT3c]]

** It certainly does give off Lovecraftian cosmic horror vibes, given the stuff about Old Gods, journals written in a mad, manic style, strange dreams, etc. A lot of the descriptions of things that put Hermione off because of their aberrant nature (The Scholar's too-long limbs, the unsettling style and prose of the journals, etc.) are Lovecraftian bread and butter, he loves mentioning how angles of architecture curve are /just so/, or how some character's face is /just off/, so as to become deeply unsettling. Furthermore, you've made Hermione your main character, who is the closest HP approximation to a Lovecraft protagonist, because they all tend to be scholarly types with entirely too much curiosity for their own good.

I think the only major deviations from the Lovecraftian style are: The fact that The Scholar actually speaks to Hermione, and ultimately explains his plan, which a Lovecraftian deity would never do; and that The Mother appears to be benevolent, which Lovecraftian deities never are. Furthermore, The Scholar is interested in "balancing" the cosmos, which is a bit too understandable of a goal to align with the comparatively inscrutable, alien reasoning and ideals of The Old Ones.

Since you want to distance yourself from cosmic horror elements, I'd cut down on the insanity aspects of the outline. People are always going to immediately associate the term "Old God" with the Great Old Ones of the Cthulhu Mythos, but when you have tomes of forbidden knowledge written by madmen, and Hermione developing auditory hallucinations and such as a result of reading the books, people will pick up on the Lovecraft vibes even more. I don't know what to angle it into instead, because personally I dig the cosmic horror aesthetic, but if you want to get rid of that, cutting out the themes of mental illness is the quickest way to do so imo.

** If it's giving off Lovecraftian vibes that strongly, I have a lot of editing to do.
