It's one I've seen recommended here several times, but I can't seem to find it. It's where Harry is found at Wool's Orphanage and is sorted into Slytherin, and Dumbledore is trying to figure out how it happened.


** Well, quick Googling gives me linkffn(Darkness is My Ally by DZ2), whose summary certainly implies the parameters you have included.

  Dumbledore's worst nightmare seems to have come to pass: finding Harry at Wool's Orphanage and then seeing him in Slytherin, the headmaster is faced with the prospect of another Tom Riddle, but the real truth about Harry is darker than he could ever imagine. Powerful Dark Lord Harry; Eventual Harry (Hadrian)/Pansy
