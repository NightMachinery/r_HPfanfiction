Personally, I am guilty of tearing apart canon that I find doesn't work or I feel can be improved. I got into an argument a few days ago with a Harry Potter fan about population numbers, especially how there is no way that Hogwarts has 1000 students and one teacher per subject. This devolved into criticising the camping trip in DH as nonsensical and dull -- e.g. why couldn't they go to muggle shops to buy/steal food under muggle disguise techniques -- and the traps for the Philosopher's Stone being easy enough for three first-years to solve.

​

She didn't take too kindly to what I said, even though I did not yell/scream etc. She told me that I was "ruining" the magic of the Potterverse and that those things "don't matter". What do you guys think?


** If you enjoy thinking critically about canon, poking plot holes, etc., then it's not too much.

If thinking critically about canon, poking plot holes, etc., starts to make you unhappy, then it is too much.

If talking critically about canon, poking plot holes, etc., makes one person in the conversation happy and the other unhappy, then both need to find another topic of conversation and neither is wrong.

** I think that fanfic writers tend to focus a lot more on the worldbuilding than the average reader, and that's where canon's greatest weakness lies. Rowling doesn't let world building get in the way of a good plotline, even if it means contradicting earlier details. Her general weakness at maths isn't helping either.

But in the end, I think the magic of the Harry Potter universe doesn't lie in rigorous worldbuilding, but rather in its whimsical nature with seemingly endless possibilities, as well as the characters that populate it.

Take LoTR for comparison. Worldbuilding perfected to the degree that you can write a historical atlas about it, but it's hard to care about most of the characters. Don't get me wrong, LoTR is a masterpiece, but I read it more for the world it's set in than for the characters.

*** I agree with what you said. I also think that there is worldbuilding that rests on internal fact and worldbuilding that rests on feeling/mood. I feel that even though the details in the HP universe don't always add up exactly, they have an emotional consistency that makes them uniquely Wizarding World. I would argue another example of strong "emotional" worldbuilding is Wes Anderson. You can't write the Silmarillion about it, but you know the Wes Anderson world when you see it, and you know/feel the Harry Potter world when you see it. Sometimes I find fanfiction that focuses on internal fact over maintaining the feeling of the HP books frustrating. I see all kinds of criticism about JK Rowling's poor worldbuilding, but I actually think she had pretty amazing worldbuilding in the sense of creating a unique world with a salient, consistent tone, that most people around the world now know and recognize. I think focusing on the facts and the methodical details is one style of worldbuilding but not the only one, and I think getting too lost in it can actually make the world being built less compelling.

** As someone who writes himself, I kinda understand how Rowling ended up where we all are right now. You very much get into the mindset of the book you write. I write grimdark arcanepunk Fantasy, and that creates its own blindspots during writing. Harry Potter was always a children to teen adventure novel. It was colorful, whimsical, had some mysteries to it and characters you could identify with. I can see how Rowling also ended up having her blindspots there while she immersed herself in her text.

Now that I'm in my late 20s, many of those things that didn't bug me about HP when I was 13, get on my nerves now. Incompetent adults, some mechanics of the worldbuilding not making sense, or even the inconsistencies. That were things that I didn't even notice back then, because I didn't care. Now that I'm an adult, things are looking different. And that is what I think is the main issue. All of the original, release-readers are now adults. We now have the mental capabilities and knowledge (and the interest) to disect this novel series.

However, I do think that in order to disect it you should never forget what it originally was. A fun, whimsical, not-too-serious adventure novel for kids and teens.

Thats one of the reasons why I think its more fun to think of reasons why something that seems like an inconsistency /isn't/ one, than to tear canon down because of it. I see that tearing down mentality here a lot and, frankly, I think its just lazy, boring and in some rare, very emotional cases, rather pathetic. We all know of the plotholes and things not adding up. Pointing those things out adds literally nothing to the shared knowledge of the community. If you prattle on about it you're just beating a dead horse.

What I always love to see is new explanations as to why something made sense. I appreciate the fillers and explanations, may they be ever so convoluted. Here is some potential for creativity that, after all these years, still isn't depleted.

I used to hate Dumbledore and ranted against him on Reddit several times. No more, I now fully recognize him as a literary plot device, and will no longer grind my axes with this character.

Of course, I still diss him whenever my family is having a discussion about HP. At least both of my children have embraced my dislike for Dumbledore, whether as a literary character or about his in-story behavior. Lol.

** This may not be where she was coming from, but personally I find criticism of the series about stuff that's ultimately a constraint of the genre to be... not wrong, but just kind of uninteresting? Like, HP is about plucky young kids saving the world - of course the obstacles in Philosopher's Stone had to be easy enough for them to get through. "Harry, Ron, and Hermione bravely went off to stop Voldemort, but got stuck at the first obstacle so they gave up and went back to bed" may be a more realistic ending, but it's far less satisfying. (This is also my objection to the complaint that all the adults are useless.) It's a fair criticism, but honestly the only way to fix it is to have HP be a fundamentally different series, which is not what I (or presumably most fans) would want.

** I mean I'll start by saying that I only write and mostly read canon compliant stuff, so that my bias out the way.

I think it's fine to criticise canon and poke holes in it, I do myself often, but I do get irritated sometimes by people that have read so much fanfic that they don't seem to like /anything/ canon anymore. Sometimes I think people should feel comfortable to admit they have outgrown the series rather than insult or belittle canon - things like exact student numbers and stuff seem silly to me to fuss over, because I think it's ok in a children's series to suspend your disbelief.

That said, there's no need to get upset and it's important to recognise that in the same way you'll never find me mentioning Grawp in any of my fics, some people feel that way about things much more crucial in canon. It's not up to me or anyone else to decide how we interact with media. I just think we should all be careful about the tone and language we use around certain criticisms.

** You can't think to hard about it. You just can't; no story is going to be perfectly logical and internally consistent unless it gets written by obsessive nerds in which case it isn't nearly as much fun. I recently ran into this problem with Naruto. HP is what it is. It is fun. It is cool. It is a great basis for fanfiction. The characters make dumb decisions and lots of the world doesn't really make sense. It's fine to point out the problems and try and fix them- */fix them/*- with fanfiction. One reasoning I've heard for the easy philosopher's stone run is that the trio was only hitting the very first layer of the challenges, which were actually a lot more dangerous but got dumbed down by Dumbledore following them to make sure they didn't kill themselves. There are lots of interesting things you can put into the story, and maybe someday someone will release the patched version where the story is basically the same but all the plot holes have been addressed. Until that day... don't think about it too hard.

** I am someone who likes to dissect and digest canon. I think it's fair that if something sets off your internal "that can't be right" alarm you can question it and either think your way around it or accept it as a flaw/plot hole.

However, the way I get enjoyment out of engaging with the material is not the same way the next person does and I think [[/u/Iniga123][u/Iniga123]] set out the most sensible suggestion for how to move forward from there.

** I think that you have to realize that 1. The series started as a kid's book even if it got more Sirius (see what I did there?) later on, so she didn't seem to be too concerned with realism. 2. The books seem to be written the same as a cop or kids tv show with a bad guy every episode theme. As such, as an entire work, its not super comprehensive.

JK is clearly more worried about the story being entertaining and carrying a message than she is about logic and cohesion. I mostly have issues with her characters not acting in accordance with what we've seen of their personalities I.e. harry not doing anything to improve himself after hearing the prophecy or Dumbledore manipulating everyone when he's supposed to love harry and be an overall nice guy.

** Great question, it's easy to get hate confused with criticism... I live in the US, the US has a lot of issues, doesn't mean I don't love living here, doesn't mean I hate the US, it just means there are issues ...

It's the same with the HP books, just because there are issues and you criticize those issues doesn't mean you can't love the books. It just means the books aren't perfect.

The great thing about books though is they are art, as a reader you should interpret them to make sense for yourself(like the teacher issue, maybe they are using timeturners, maybe they have a hologram that teaches classes, maybe they have assistants that is polyjuice potion....you can fill the blank yourself and that's fantastic)

Now I will say if a person can't sit down and read the HP books without getting "triggered"every 2 seconds, then they probably aren't for them, but that's okay they can't be for everyone

** I think it's fine to criticize canon in certain degrees where it's warranted. Frankly, I feel no qualms about tearing apart The Cursed Child since so much of it is just nonsense. That being said, there's obviously a point of excess, and I think "too much" depends on the intent and behavior of the person taking note of the flaws. For me, the "too much" range is when the intent is malicious or the criticism appears to be for the sake of criticism and tearing apart something popular.

I actually agree with both perspectives. I love poking holes into stories and if someone wants to discuss logical errors in the Hayrry Potter books with me, I'll enthusiastically join them.

However, at the same time I do think that the best way to enjoy Harry Potter is to shut down that part of your brain and instead just accept that not all things in the HP universe make perfect sense.

For example, I tend to really dislike it if a fanfic starts explaining every little plothole as a lie that evil!Dumbledore told Harry to control him because I feel it goes against the spirit of everything I enjoy about Harry Potter in the first place.

** If you just tear apart canon for the sake of doing so, then you achieve very little. But if you try to eliminate a few of the plotholes because you don't want them in your stories, and not do it in a MOR fashion, then that is generally ok.

That being said, there are a few issues canon simply does not address which need to be addressed, most related to criminal justice.

** Your friend got butthurt by the truth.

​

It is true the first book was incredibly nonsensical and the "traps" ridiculous. Ninja Warrior has better traps.

​

As for the camping trip, it was crap. The entire trip was useless and ridiculous, just going to an abandoned warehouse and just protecting it would have been more useful. Apparate, confuse some burgerking or mcdonalds employee to give them whoppers and your food problem is over.

​

And yeah the population thing was a joke unless there was a more famous english school that took about 98% of the population because if that isn't the case I don't see them surviving a century more.
