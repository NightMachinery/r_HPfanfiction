** Most of the classics in the HP fandom are Harry/Ginny. Let's see now :

1. [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/barb/][Barb's Trilogy]]\\
2. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/282139/1/After-the-End][After the End]]\\
3. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3689325/1/The-Original-Naked-Quidditch-Match][The Naked Quidditch Match]]\\
4. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3994212/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Sword-of-the-Hero][The Hero Trilogy]]\\
5. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/180388/][The Amulet of Time series]]\\
6. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2636963/1/][Nightmares of the Future's past]]\\
   7.[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1709027/1/The-Awakening-Power][The Awakening Power]]

Of course, not all of them have aged well. /The Naked Quidditch match/ is sill hilarious though.

Since I'm not entirely sure what qualifies as a classic, here are some other HG recs, all of them plot oriented rather than romance oriented :

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/637123/1/The-Phoenix-and-the-Serpent][The Phoenix and the Serpent]] : HG epic, Harry goes on a quest reminiscent of LoTR. Highly, highly recommended.\\
[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4101650/1/Backward_With_Purpose][Backwards With a Purpose]] : Best canon redo. A bit slow paced initially, but really catches up later. Highly Recommended.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3928184/2/Destiny-Redefined][Destiny redefined]] : Underrated Time Travel fic. This one is quite dark.\\
[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6256154/1/The-Unforgiving-Minute][The Unforgiving Minute]] : Fast paced, action oriented time travel fic. Harry has only twelve hours to destroy all the horcruxes and kill Voldemort. Highly, highly recommended.\\
[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4889913/1/Hallows-and-Pathos][Hallows and Pathos]] : A dark take on the Deathly Hallows. Features Harry as the Master of Death.\\
[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6331126/1/Strangers-at-Drakeshaugh][Strangers of Drakeshaugh]] : Post DH fic. Great portrayal of the Potters from an outside POV. Highly recommended.\\
[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4396574/1/The-Wendell-That-Wasn-t][The Wendell that Wasn't]] : Crack oneshot. This is the funniest thing I've ever read.\\
[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9002915/1/The-Minister-s-Daughter][The Minister's Daughter]] : Harry/Ginny. Harry/OC. This has both romance and action.\\
[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9526039/1/Out-of-the-Fire-and-into-the-Cupboard][Out of the fire and into the Cupboard]] : Fun oneshot. Well worth reading.\\
[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4291790/1/Polyjuice-Memory-Charms-and-More][Polyjuice, Memory Charms and more]] : HG smut. Polyjuice sex is extremely kinky.

There are quite a few more I can't seem to recall atm. Anyway, all of the above stories are of very good quality, and well worth reading regardless of your feelings about HG.

*** Seconding the Phoenix and the Serpent. It is absolutely fantastic and has aged very well.
