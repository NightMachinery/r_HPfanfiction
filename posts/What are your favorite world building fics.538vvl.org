*** More like colossal waste of time lands! AmIRight?

...I'm sorry.

I like the Sacrifices Arc for world building though it's tremendously AU.

** The writing was subpar sometimes, but I've never forgotten the AU magical worldbuilding in linkffn(8629685). Along with Wen Spencer's A Brother's Price, the harem worldbuilding based on a gender birthrate discrepancy is just really fascinating, because I had never realized before that monogamous relationships are the most common type of relationship because the male/female birthrate is essentially 50/50. And the rest of the differences in magical Britain are really unusual for fanfics.

  He stepped into a world he didn't understand, following footprints he could not see, toward a destiny he could never imagine. How can one boy make a world brighter when it is so very dark to begin with? A completely AU Harry Potter universe.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.
