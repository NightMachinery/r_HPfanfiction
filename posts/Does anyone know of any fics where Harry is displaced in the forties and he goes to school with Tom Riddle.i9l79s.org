I basically want the recs to be either Tomarry or gen, and I don't want Harry ending up going against Riddle. Something like linkao3(Forsaken) is what I'm aiming for. Thanks for any recs!

  Harry was forsaken his whole life, nothing ever stayed the same and if it did it endangered or hurt Harry in some way shape or form. This revolves in all things, and his pass with fortune ends when after he finally destroys Voldemort, a Death Eater decides to murder him. Death is unhappy with Harry being his master, but acknowledges Harry never had a chance of anything but a horrible life. Granting Harry with his full amount of power with no compulsions, Death sets him up to go to Hogwarts in 1940s where he can truly discover who he is.Rewrite at https://archiveofourown.org/works/25608754/chapters/62157601
