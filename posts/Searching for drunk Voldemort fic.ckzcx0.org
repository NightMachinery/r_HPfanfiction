Trying to find a fic I read were Tom gets drunk after Dumbledore rejects his job application and goes on to kill several people and drunkenly declare that he was the Dark Lord Voldemort. He lamented that he would have never have called himself such a stupid name had he been sober. Obviously a humor fic.

  The presence of a foreign soul may have unexpected side effects on a growing child. I am Lord Volde...Harry Potter. I'm Harry Potter. In which Harry is insane, Hermione is a Dark Lady-in-training, Ginny is a minion, and Ron is confused.
