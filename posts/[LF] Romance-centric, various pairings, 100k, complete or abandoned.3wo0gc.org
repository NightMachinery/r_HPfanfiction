I'm looking for any stories that focus on the build up of a pairing, not established relationships. Please no marriage contracts/magical bonding/creature soul mate/etc. Any other plot should be very much secondary to the relationship; no-Voldemort!AUs or stories where he's killed off early are acceptable. Little or no bashing preferred, but if the romance is good then I'll put up with it.

Pairings:

- Harry/Draco
- Harry/Snape (Time travel or teacher/student)
- Harry/Riddle (Time travel or "Voldemort got deaged and lost his memories"; Saved By Tru Luv^{TM} is fine)
- Hermione/Snape (Time travel or teacher/student)
- Snape/Lupin
- Lucius/Narcissa (If there's a good could-be-canon fic of their relationship then feel free to ignore the word count limit)
- Hermione/any female
- Next Gen femslash

  Hermione/any female
#+end_quote

I am glad you like this. I do too.

linkffn(Time Heals All Wounds by brightsilverkitty) is a superior Hermione/Bellatrix fic, by means of time travel and incredible emotional torque. linkffn(The Scientist by greysfanhp) is an ongoing Hermione/Narcissa fic which is really quite good so far.

Sadly I don't really prefer any of the other pairings you mentioned, so I don't have any recs.
