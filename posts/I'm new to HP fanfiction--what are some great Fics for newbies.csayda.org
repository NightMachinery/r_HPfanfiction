Hello! I'm a long time Harry Potter lover but relatively new to fanfiction. Over the years I've began reading a few, but quickly lose interest either because of poor writing, poor plot lines, or simply too slow paced.

I'm looking for a relatively short fic (maybe 1 to 3 hours to read the entire thing) that isn't entirely about a pairing or a romance, but just about anything else I'm willing to try. I haven't read even close to enough to have much of a preference for anything yet, so I'm willing to explore!

What are some great fanfics by great authors that aren't too long and will make me want to read more fanfictions?

Thanks!

** One of my favorite places to check is tvtropes' fanfic recs page for Harry Potter. They split it up by type, list pairings, and give a synopsis. Just take it all with a grain of salt and remember that it's only occasionally updated.

If you don't mind trying something a bit longer, there's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4536005/1/Oh-God-Not-Again][Oh God Not Again!]] Is it 50 chapters long? Yes. Is it also hilarious and well worth going through all 50 chapters? Also yes. It's a bit cracky, but great fun all the same, as Harry makes a mockery of the books as we know them.

** Personally, I'd recommend more crack/comedic fics to start off with. They don't take themselves too seriously, and to be honest the writing is usually way better because of it. In more serious fics oftentimes I'll find overused tropes, cringey dialogue, and poorly written character developement. I've developed a taste for what I like, and if a story has enough of those points I can get past the worse-off parts of the fics, but like I said, I find comedies to be better written and easier to get into.

Linkffn(Seventh Horcrux) The gist of this one is that Harry's body is taken over by the Horcrux in his scar. Voldemort sees this as a way to start a new life for himself where he's not an criminal and pursue his dream of teaching. His paranoid, somewhat insane, and hilarious.

Linkffn(A Black Comedy) I only recently read this one after a post on here about how the humor in SH and ABC is similar, yet people are a lot more divided on this fic than SH. Personally I really enjoyed it. The humor is a lot more crude, so that's subject to your own tastes, but I don't think the overly crude stuff is there for long enough to take away from the rest of the plot. It also has quite a few interesting ways of handling magical abilities and the wizarding government.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Sword of Gryffindor) This one is quite a bit longer, and will take several hours to get through. It's also some very smutty humor and has a lot of sexual content (takes place during 7th year, so they're adults, no worries). It's part crack fic and part pretty good Horcrux Hunting story. Some bashing at the beginning that does get resolved later in the fic.

Linkffn(The Green in the Grey; Son of Potter, Daughter of Black) TGITG is a work in progress, and SoP,DoB is on an indefinite haitus. These are two of the more serious fics that I really enjoy. TGITG is a wrong boy who lived story, but a lot more well done than others I've read. SoP,DoB is a story where Sirius visits Harry during the summer before 4th year and actually looks after him. It's also a gender-bender fic, where Harry turna into a girl. Fairly well written despite a few instances of poor/overdramatic writing.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Bodacious Bodyguard) Another work in progress, where Tonks goes undercover at Hogwarts to ensure Harry's safety and tries to hekp him get his shit together as well. It's been fairly slow to update but it's still being worked on.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Metamorph) This is a completed work where Harry leaves Britain and trains on his own in America. He learns that he has metamorph abilities he's been unable to use and has Tonks help train him. He then returns to Britain and faces down Voldemort. It's another one that's part serious, part comedy. If you couldn't tell I'm a fan of HarryxTonks.

Finally, linkffn(Harry Potter and the Summer of Change) This is NOT a short fic. It's longer than the first 3 books combined, and it just takes place over the summer between 5th and 6th year. It's also filled with those issues I mentioned earlier. It's full of overused indy-Harry tropes and clichés (granted it's a pretty old fic so it was somewhat original when it came out), the writing is overdramatic and somewhat cringey at times (I feel like the author was heavily inspired by anime), and a lot of people feel like the relationship is underdeveloped and moves too fast (they have a point).

That being said, Summer of Change is one of my favorite fics. It has a cloak-and-daggers vibe, with the magical CIA essentially, has Harry working towards a goal and being a badass, as bad-temper and poorly-spoken as he can be at times, there's lots of fluffy moments between my favorite pairing, and even though the character developement is all over the place, Harry does grow and learn from his actions, as do the people on his side he's been butting heads with through the whole story. I'd say it's at least worth giving a look into at some point.

Later on I might come back and add some others to the list, these were just the ones off the top of my head.

** I'm fairly new myself, but I can suggest a couple long ones I got into.

linkffn(To Know You is to Love You by CoyoteLaughingSoftly) 500K+ words of nothing but Ron/Hermione. Takes a deep dive into the canon ship, and explores it thoroughly.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief by Starfox5) An AU fic where Hermione Granger is expelled for a crime she didn't commit, and she swears to get her revenge. Features a (very) slow burn Harry/Hermione, overpowered Harry Ron and Hermione, and a lot of crazy action.

linkao3(Pluto by bikelock28) A large collection of oneshots revolving around Lupin/Tonks. Jumps around the timeline a lot, but paints a full picture of their relationship. Updates still ongoing.

Linkffn(Seventh Horcrux) almost can't go wrong with that one. Pretty much everyone seems to like it.

Romance:

Linkffn(His Angel) A good Harry X Fleur where canon diverges just before 4th year. Linkffn(Call me by wrexscar) Harry X Lisa Turpin set in the holidays after 5th or 6th year (can't remember) not much magic involved.

Werewolf!Harry:

Linkffn(The wolf lord)

Vampire!Harry:

Linkffn(twists of fate by Lanidur Du'Undarian) this could also come under comedy (do not take this fic seriously). In my opinion it's the funniest fic I have read. Linkffn(undead secrets by bittericing)

WBWL (wrong boy who lived) and non-bwl:

Linkffn(deprived by the crimson lord) Linkffn(Harry potter and the elemental changes) Linkffn(Harry potter and the boy who lived) Linkffn(knowledge is power by defenestratable)

Time travel:

Linkffn(the disorder of the Phoenix) Linkffn(delenda est) Linkffn(the second string) technically dimension travel Linkffn(broken reflections by JacobApples) Linkffn(Wind shear)

MoD!Harry (master of death)

Linkffn(time to put you galleons where your mouth is) Linkffn(on a pale horse)

  My take on Harry's first year starting with him getting his letters. Add a lot of sarcasm, stir, and serve cold.

  A VERY long Tuesday in the life of Minerva McGonagall. With rampant Umbridgeitis, uncooperative Slytherins, Ministry interventions, an absent Dumbledore and a schoolwide shortage of Hot Cocoa, it's a wonder she's as nice as she is.

  Fifteen months in Azkaban Prison following the Chamber of Secrets fiasco leaves Harry Potter less than interested in being anybody's hero, and thanks to his psychotic friends, unreliable allies, persistent enemies, prophecies, tournaments, war, politics, magic insanity, and the perils of true love, it'd be a wonder if any of us remained sane. Still, it's the only game in town...
