For those of you who don't know, it's a fic where magicals perceive Harry to be a girl. However, both muggles and Harry himself, perceive him to be a boy. It's an interesting fic with the funniest Padma in all of fanfiction.

  Harry always knew that there was something unique about him. In a way, the arrival of the Hogwarts acceptance letters was almost expected... except, why are they all addressed to 'Harriet Potter?
