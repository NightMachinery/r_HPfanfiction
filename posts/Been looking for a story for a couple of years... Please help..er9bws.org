Hello I am looking for a long old'ish story that I believe was completed. Below is all that I can remember about the story. 

Harry is OP

Harry raised an island out of the ocean floor close to England 

The island has a large bay

Luna, Hermione, and Padma mix magic and tech

Harry using his power charges these runic "batteries" to use as a power source to powers all tech

They steal a navy ship from the US navy and deck it out using magic-tech

They buy older airplanes and upgrade them too

Luna built on under ground massive complex by the bay for a secret project that even Harry did not know the details of

At some point the US nukes the main city on the island killing many of Harry's friends

  Just because things happened in one time-line, doesn't mean they have to happen in this one. At least, that's Jane Kirk's determined opinion upon being told she and Spock were married in that other reality. The universe, however, has other ideas - and the spirit of her dead counterpart stuck inside her head isn't helping matters. This story was originally published over at FanFic.Net on: October 26th 2013.

  There was definitely something going on between those two. Even though I had been confined to the flabby meat sack known as Lester Papadopoulos. I could tell when people had history. But I wasn't sure if it was good or bad. I never would've guessed it though. OR: "You look good considering the last time I saw you we were fighting a giant primordial Goddess along side a brother I didn't know I had."

  It is said that a universe is created the moment a possibility is perceived, making a tree of infinite branches, each representing a life that could have been. So maybe it's not so impossible to believe that there was a time and place where we lived happily. Lived without burdens, guilt, without war. In a life where we only had to exist for ourselves.

  The Vanguard thought Crota had been banished from their realm for good after the successful strike, unaware that the Traveler had different plans and saved Crota's soul before it could be lost again to darkness. Crota wakes on Earth, except not as a Hive Prince but as a human male. He's lost his memories but the Speaker is there to guide him. He has no trouble fighting the Cabal, Fallen, and the Vex, but the slight hesitation he has when in the face of the Hive and Taken do not go unnoticed by his teammates.The Hive haven't forgotten their Prince and neither has the Taken King, who unknowingly is fighting a war against his own son. But Crota has bigger things to fear like how Eris Morn is watching his every move and the reappearance of the Guardian who killed him the first time around.

  After the incident at the graveyard, Harry realised that he was not in the least bit prepared to fight against Voldemort or his Death Eaters. When a curse of the Dark Lord, that was meant for Lucius starts to effect him as well, Harry starts to see many things in a different light and finally finds the bravery to take his fate into his own hands.
