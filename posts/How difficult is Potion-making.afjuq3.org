Snape sells his subject as arcane science of incredible difficulty and yet, just using Snape's notes Harry becomes the best brewer of his year.

So how difficult is the subject actually? The "just like cooking" explanation is certainly thrown around a lot, but how accurate is that?


** you may as well ask why any magic is difficult at all. why don't people discover powerful and new magic by trying random latin words? harry doesn't understand the law slughorn explains in hbp- but it's a pretty simple law, and jkr has slug say it in over the top language to make it seem difficult. so either harry is stupid, or it was meant to seem like a scientific law of relative difficulty to understand

that being said, potions actually does sound like it will be difficult in the real world. things have to be measured, timed, stirred exactly. very easy to fuck up. memorizing a long list of ingredients, what they do, how to harvest them, how they react under different circumstances etc. is a lot to know. not to mention knowing what's going on with a potion by looking at/smelling it

** You might as well ask, indeed, "how hard is cooking?". The facts of the matter is that it's incredibly difficult to become a Potionneer --- to understand Potions on a deep enough level to create new Potions and to intuitively known when to stir, when to add the ingredients, etc., rather than strictly follow a detailed list of instructions without understanding them. Most people can do fried eggs or boil water using the latter approach; if they're good at memorizing long lists of instructions and carrying them out with precision, they might even be very good at making soufflés or roast beef or other more "advanced" dishes. But you need a special gift, and lots of experience, to do /without/ the cookbook and invent a new dish, or a new way to prepare a dish.

*** But cooking is fairly easy because your objective is to create a meal. You can throw together most vegetables in a pan with bacon and onions and the result will be edible as long as you don't burn it. The exact ratios do not matter much because it will taste decent in most cases. Throw in some herbs and spices and you are done. But potion making aims to accomplish a way more complicated goal. You don't want to brew a potion, you want a potion which does X. Chemistry or Pharmacy would be way better comparisons.

Cooking must be an odd thing, then, because some recipes for cakes specifically say to add oil. And it's not really the point, the point is that while getting /some kind of effect/ may be considered a success by some, to people who want a specific result it may not be, just like starting out with a plan for a chocolate cake and ending up with a fudge sludge may not be considered a success by anyone with culinary ambitions.

Yes, to a certain degree you are free to add whatever. But a lot of it is only because even if you don't cook you have a lot of knowledge about what stuff is edible and what isn't and how it tastes from just eating it and from seeing how it's used in various recipes. I guess one could claim that you could get the same from imbibing potions ingredients, The-Elder-Scrolls--style, and it could make for a fun AU thing, but if we are talking about stuff that's canon to Harry Potter then there's an implication that you won't and that instead it's a long list of stuff to memorise, possibly with some help from some rules like the one talked about by Slughorn.

**** Cooking basic and simple things is easy, very much like first year potions is also easy. But creating more complex dishes that require a well developed palette, advanced cooking techniques, time management, knowledge of your ingredients, etc. is not simple at all. And for complex potions where the smallest of mistakes or imperfections can cause your potion to fail (or worse explode) the consequences are also more dire.

Look at cooking where most people are able to make dishes well enough, some are good amateur cooks, some can get by with a career in food, but only a select few are star chefs. For potions most people can make basic potions, some have a little more talent, but only a few are true potions masters.

Neville melted his cauldron during his first lesson. If it eats through a cauldron, it might eat through the floor as well. And that was the introduction to the subject. Try doing the same with basic pasta.

Boiling pasta for too long will make the pasta dish not as good as it could have been, but will not make it inedible. While cooking a potion for too long can have potentially disastrous effects. That doesn't make the brewing of the potion more difficult though.

********** Objection, Your Honor, this is pure conjecture.

Who's to say there aren't simple potions that involve boiling one ingredient for 10 to 12 minutes in a bunch of water with a teaspoon or so of a second ingredient added in.

If I was Snape, you can bet your ass I would tell those first-years it has to be exactly 11.5 minutes, exactly a teaspoon of eye-of-newt, and don't forget to stir clockwise three times so your noodles don't clump together. If only so they'd get used to following directions before getting to the more complicated potions where that stuff really is important. And it's canon that you can sometimes get a passing grade even if your portion is a little off-color from the ideal, which implies that it would still work even if you were less than exact in some of the steps.

We never actually got that much information about what exactly is involved in most of the potions in the book, so I don't think we can say that /most potions can fail at any steps where you add ingredients/.

I do agree that cooking is probably not a very good metaphor, though. I would say it's more like baking, specifically the kind that comes with a panel of judges, and you fail if your bread is too much like a country French loaf and not enough like ciabatta, or the custard layer in your cake is too runny.

** A neat headcanon can be found in linkffn(Applied Cultural Anthropology by jacobk), which has the following scene:

#+begin_quote
  As Ron and Harry prepared their workstation, Hermione started asking Neville a few questions about the Blister Reduction Potion. She wanted to make sure he had done the reading before starting his brewing--Neville was usually pretty good about that sort of thing now, but she felt it was better to be safe than sorry. She had also recently started using this question and answer session to focus Neville on potential trouble spots in the brewing potion. Doing the reading wasn't enough if you didn't understand what the book was trying to tell you.

  She smiled when Neville correctly identified the signs of too much heat being applied during the reduction stage of the potion, and then blinked in surprise when she glanced over at the other two. They were both staring at Neville, jaws agape. Harry recovered his voice first.

  "Where'd you learn all that, Nev?" Harry asked.

  "It's in the book," Neville mumbled, blushing.

  "What? Where?" Harry asked.

  "What do you mean, where?" Hermione asked. "It's right after the brewing instructions."

  "We're supposed to read that?" Harry asked, then recoiled at the glare Hermione turned on him. "I mean, I know we're supposed to read that stuff when Snape gives us essays to write, but otherwise I didn't think we needed to."

  "Yeah," Ron said, jumping in. "We follow the directions, so we ought to get the right potion. We wanted you to tell us why it's not working."

  "I don't believe this," Hermione said, pinching the bridge of her nose. "You've been treating your potions text like a cookbook."

  "Well," Harry said, sounding genuinely puzzled, "it has a list of recipes describing how to combine ingredients to get the proper result, so yeah."

  "Ok," Hermione said, "the last step of the Boil Cure Potion is to stir five times clockwise. How fast do you stir it?"

  "Kind of a normal stirring speed?" Harry said.

  "How do you know if you're going too fast or too slow? How do you fix it if you do?" Hermione asked. "You're not scrambling eggs here. You're creating a precise combination of magical ingredients to produce a result that violates the laws of nature! There are any number of tiny variations in how people will interpret the same directions, you have to know how to account for those things."

  The "just like cooking" explanation
#+end_quote

This is BS and is used by imbeciles. Potions has you adding seemingly toxic ingredients to get radically different products - from a muggle perspective, that clearly denotes that chemical reactions take place. Cooking cannot do that - turn toxic ingredients into edible food (normally).

Potions is just as difficult as Snape says it is - first years have a big book of 1000 ingredients (which they use throughout the seven years) they need to know everything about. Just having so much to memorise alone makes it a lot more difficult than chemistry. It's also a very exact process - adding one extra teaspoonful of hellebore causes Harry's Draught of Peace to be ruined completely. Each step involved in the brewing is more or less timed, and there's theory behind even the direction of stirring.

In short, it is nothing like cooking.

#+begin_quote
  just using Snape's notes Harry becomes the best brewer of his year.
#+end_quote

Harry does not become the best brewer in his year - he becomes the best at following instructions. When Slughorn tests his students on something that involves knowledge of theory, Harry fails miserably.

Harry gets those potions right following Snape's modifications, but he doesn't understand the reason behind those modifications and why they make the potion superior to the text book. Why inserting one counterclockwise stir every 3-4 clockwise stirs, or why crushing the ingredients instead of chopping them yields superior results - he doesn't know any of that.

Since he doesn't understand the differences, his successes in the Potions classroom during his sixth year is more or less equivalent to labour - it's like the difference between a student who knows not to throw sodium into water because of the explosion it will cause, and a student who doesn't throw sodium into water because someone wrote it in their textbook. The one lesson where Potions concepts are tested, the lesson with Gopalott's law or whatever it's called, Harry fails miserably.

That's basically Harry in a nutshell. As a character, and a wizard, he's basically impossible to respect or take seriously. Rowling can TELL us over and over how good a wizard Harry is, how much he's grown, but she sure fucking sucks ass at showing it.

I mean, Harry is supposed to be some sort of Defense prodigy. But do we ever see him show an ounce of independent study (Minus the patronus of course)? I mean...just imagine, instead of sitting through stupid fucking boring dumbass retarded Wizard soccer (Seriously...fuck Quidditch till the end of time) we actually saw Harry inventing his own defense spells or something. Something he is working on in say, book 3, and then it pays off in book 5.

But no...because Rowling just doesn't think it's important.

#+end_quote

On the contrary, it's extremely common for cooking to turn an indigestible ingredient into a nutritious one.

For example, raw potatoes are primarily composed of a type of starch that the human digestive tract cannot fully process. Cooking changes the starch to a different form that can be broken down in the digestive system and used for energy by the body.

Raw beans contain a toxic compound called lectin. If you consumed a meal of raw beans you would poison yourself. Raw kidney beans are especially toxic. Soaking & cooking breaks the lectin down into a different compound that is not harmful.

There are just as many (in reality probably more) compounds and precise chemical reactions that could be memorized in chemistry. The only difference is that chemists use tools, such as computers, to keep track of all of that information for them.

And maybe Neville's just dyslexic? And being a wizard, they don't know how to diagnose that?

** I would also argue that Harry is good at potions in sixth year because he's following improved directions exactly. I recently read a fic that had the issue described pretty well. It said they follow directions but Harry doesn't know why he can crush the beans instead of cutting them or if you can do this for all potions or just living death. How it works for cooking is most people don't care why certain ingredients/times are what they are because if they follow directions exactly they'll get it right. I live in North Carolina and have had jobs in restaurants and the number of times I've been making stuff and the experienced cooks don't know how much stuff they put in but estimate what they need, taste it and keep doing it like that is astounding. One place there was no set recipe so everyone did it slightly their own way with a bit of different tastes. In potions experienced brewers would add it stuff based off knowledge/instinct to make the potion more effective, last longer, taste better or whatever.

In other words could, for example, Hermione reverse engineer the better instructions in order to understand why they are better?

Well, you teach a train driver how to drive a train and not how to build one. Or a racecar driver. Or the crew of a warship. And while builders know how to build buildings, they are not the ones producing the base material.

You are generally taught what you need and the Potions course does just that.
