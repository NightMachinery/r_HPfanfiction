We all know that there are certain things- characterisations, descriptions, adjective usages, etc- that we could do well without (looking at you, Avada Kedavra orbs). But what about things we don't see enough of? Unique AU world buildings, unique characterisations away from all the clichés we usual see? Have you guys read a story so different in certain aspects that it inspired you, that you thought "why isn't there more of this", that you searched for similar stories but came up empty? For me personally it has got to be the Jen Black Saga, from Silently Watches. The world building, the way magic is described and used, I loved it. Sadly, I have yet to find other real quality HP fics like that.

In case you haven't read the story yet, here's the link to the first (sry, I'm on mobile): [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8233291/1/Princess-of-the-Blacks]]

So, let the discussion commence!


** There should be more mystery style fics. The whole Harry Potter series has had each book have a underlying mystery for Harry to figure out and solve, and JKR drops in hints and clues throughout the book that lead up to a grand reveal at the end. This is very satisfying as a reader.

I think writers should branch out of tropes with predefined expectations and have more original ideas. Or if a story is based on a common theme, like fem!Harry, make it so different and unpredictable so that it is enjoyable to read.

** Fast Pacing. Pacing and concision is one of the most often mangled things in long-form fanfics which otherwise have potential.

Consider the following facts, which might be sort of mindblowing if you've been reading HP fanfic for a while:

- Philsopher's Stone is 76,944 words long.\\
- Chamber of Secrets is 85,141 words long.
- Prisoner of Azkaban is 107,253 words long.

I don't think I've seen a 100k words fanfic that had even /half/ as much shit happen as a Philosopher's Stone in terms of plot points covered, characters introduced, setting explored, etc. Most fics that hit /200k/ words, get to that wordcount without having half as much happen as any /single one/ of those three books.

The last four HP books were comparatively bloated and slow (possibly because Rowling was at that point capable of bossing around any editor), but /even then/ they /averaged/ only just over 200k words. I'm /not sure/ I've /ever/ seen a fic in the ~200k words range have as much sheer /stuff/ happen as, say, Goblet of Fire (190k words).

It's like the fandom looked at the last four books by Rowling, and said as one: "/No,/ we must go /even slower than that/! Rowling wasn't slow /enough/ in the later books, compared to the first ones!"

*** When I first looked up word counts, I was astounded! JKR's published work is so much more concise than a lot of the fanfic I enjoy to read. I'd have to say that OotP is the most bloated book, something JKR has said in the past, and that's 257,045 words. I've read 300k+ word fics that have had much less happen!

Editing to publish a book cuts down on a lot of excess in a book. Everything in Philosopher's Stone is very much linked to the plot, or necessary world building/character development/foreshadowing for future books.

I personally like fanfic that meanders a bit, especially if the author is talented at writing action and dialogue. Sometimes length can't be helped, especially if it's supposed to be a seven book fanfic series. On the other hand, slower writing can becomes a chore to read if I deem boring and just hit the back button.

Pacing is also important for the sustainability of the fic. If the author takes forever to get to the next plot point, the likelihood of the story finishing dramatically decreases. I recently read a 1.1 million plus word fanfic series that's still ongoing and I wonder if authors don't get burnt out by writing so much

*** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Summer of Change) is over 300k words, and literally is just the summer between 5th and 6th year. Like, that's longer than the first three books combined.

Personally I never felt that the pacing was bad in that story (granted it does cover basically every day during the summer, and it has enough going on each day to make it feel like the story is advancing despite the short time frame) so I think longer fics can still do pacing well, especially if they go into more detail/have more things happen than the original stories do. It's just not always done well.

** One of the first fanfictions I read, in fact. It only had a few thousand words, and I don't even remember its name, but it made me search for more. To no avail, though. It was a fanfiction about Grindelwald and Dumbledore having a discussion. The discussion was in fact about nothing at all, and yet managed to convey what 'Greater Good' truly means. It is a concept so misunderstood and abused in Harry Potter fanfictions because people were unable to comprehend where it stems from, that I always find myself remembered of that little fanfic, when I read about 'the Greater Good' or some scheming Dumbledore doing this or that.

I wish people would /think/ and give us more depth to a character. /How/ and /Why/ do they act? What morals drive them? What is their motive? I am quite tired of 'suddenly he's dark', without explaining what 'dark' is, and how the character came to be 'dark'. Was he good before? And what is the good he was before? [...]

Since I haven't found yet anything of the sort, I have gotten started on writing something along the lines myself. It is interesting, to say the least, because the more I dive into the idea, the more I learn myself, and the more I want to write.

When I found linkffn(Latet Anguis In Herba) my response was, "This is amazing!! First of all, why have I never heard of this story before, and second of all, why aren't there more stories like this??"

*** I love good OC stories. They are a great way to expand on the world. The problem is that a lot of the times OCs are created for other purposes, it serns. As love interest for canon characters of as super-powerful "helper" ( more like spotlight stealer, but nominally, in many of those stories, Harry still is the main hero). - Thus, many people are weary of OCs.

The second issue is that more people simply are attached to our main characters and want to read more about them. Thus, less interest in fics not about them exists.

** General:

- Originality. You'd think, given the large quantity of HP fanfiction out there, that there would be a lot of variety. But when there's literally 5000 completely interchangeable indy!Harry bashing fics out there, and similar numbers for other popular tropes, the fandom very quickly shrinks.

Specific:

- Talented Harry who retains his core canon character. Most talented Harry fics will do a character transplant. But PoA already laid down a path for Harry to be talented in his own learn-by-doing way.

- Genuinely magical magic. Almost all fics treat magic as a physical force. Even those that explicitly denounce magic as energy will tend to still have it as an energy analogue.

- Non-harem, M-rated Harry/Susan.

- The trio. Almost all fanfic ditches at least one member as soon as possible. It's a very rare fic that keeps them together and expands on their dynamic (see: Forging the Sword). Given that their friendship is one of the key draws of the series, this is unfortunate.

To expand a bit on that, I'd love to see more stories willing to just ditch the stations of canon. Most fics seem to adhere to them to a degree that's downright contrived. I'm seriously sick of seeing stuff like:

- Fake Moody gets caught but Voldemort still places Harry in the tournament somehow.

- Harry strikes a close friendship with Ginny in CoS but the chamber plot continues in exactly the same fashion.

- Pettigrew is caught and questioned just long enough to prove Sirius innocence but then miraculously escapes from ministry custody so he can fulfil his part in the graveyard plot.

- The graveyard in general. I'm just sick of it because it always seems to happen the exact same way. Even if Harry is rediculously powerful and/or competent or even rediscovered some ancient method of unblockable instant teleportation he somehow always manages to be incapacitated by Wormtail of all people for long enough to complete the ritual. For fuck's sake, just come up with an original way to revive Voldemort for once.

- Same thing applies to a lesser degree to the Ministry trap in OotP and the Hogwarts raid in HbP, though thankfully there's usually a bit more creativity there.

**** The thing is, unless you are at Dumbledore's/Voldemort's level, your best choice for combat magic are area-of-effect spells like blasting curses. Using anything else is just hindering yourself. Why disarm with magic when you can quite literally disarm your enemy? Why stun fascist thugs trying to purge an entire race when you can put them down for good? They will just be revived by their comrades.

Obviously, transfiguring field fortifications or otherwise creating cover is valid if you have time, but by the time you have turned that bookshelf behind the Death Eater into a lion, you took a blood boiling curse and are slowly and painfully dying while the DE can deal with the lion unmolested.

Of course, things like +magical mortar rounds+ mandrakes have their uses, but only in certain situations.

And I know that it takes some of the "magic" away to turn duels into gunfights, but there is a reason armies drop bombs on the enemy instead of beer.

You also only have a finite amount of space to fill, and more than three characters make scenes very confusing (dialogue tags everywhere). If you want to include a new character, someone else has to go, or you need to be a really, really skilled writer to pull the narrative off (I certainly am not).

Also, not every character fits every plot. Say for whatever reason Harry gets into underground street racing/tuning (eg Sirius left him an R-33 Skyline and Harry needs something to take his mind off from Voldemort). How do you shoehorn Ron into a story about superchargers, compression ratios and the like if he cannot even use a telephone? Harry might have read a lot of books about cars while at Privet Drive and he has a clear-cut motivation, but someone raised with magic?

*** Can you expand a bit on the idea of Harry learning by doing as opposed to having a personality transplant? I'll agree that most fics that power up Harry/make him more talented do so by turning him into a bookworm, but the only alternative I can think of is having him learn from a succession of powerful tutors (and then that raises the question of where they were/what they were doing during the whole First/Second war). I'm wondering if there's a way to have him learn by doing that's still mostly self-driven or if the only route that doesn't involve others is the book-learning route that most authors choose.

** Character impact: I've read stories where either OCs are introduced, or one character makes a critical game-changing decision...only for the plot to follow exactly as canon. What the fuck, how can the plot not change if massive decisions that are apparently game changing happen? Also, why introduce a damn OC if all the OC ever does is be an additional name in the story without changing the events of the story?

Duelling: To many authors, duelling ends at fucking shit like Expelliarmus and Stupefy. A second year charm, and a fourth year spell respectively. For Dark wizards, it ends with the unforgivables. FFS people, include some kickass scenes, like the battle between Dumbledore and Voldemort! That scene had real power, where the two combatants shaped the battlefield according to their will, that's what I'd really like to see more of. Some elemental spells, transfiguration, inventive uses of charms - these things can make duels amazing, and is what Dumbledore essentially uses in that fight. But nope, instead we're left with veteran Aurors shouting Expelliarmus and Stupefy at the top of their voices.

I also read another post Hogwarts fic where the whole controlled Ice Queen thing is thrown by the wayside and she's portrayed as an average student with a penchant to use explicit language, also a very unique portrayal. I love Daphne fics in any form and even the standard fanon iteration of her I enjoy, but for such a blank slate I just wish for more variation.

On another note I would also like way more fics exploring Lilly and Harry's relationship. There are plenty of fics where his parents are alive or time travel or dimension travel happens, but those fics so rarely have a good portrayal of Lily. I want her to be prominent and Harry finally getting a mother to be an important part of the story.

  When Voldemort's assassins find him Harry flees seeking a place to prepare for the battle. Bloodmagic, wandlessmagic, necromancy, fae, a thunderbird, demons, vampires. Harry finds the strength & allies to win a war. Singularly unique fic.

** More fics like Alexandra Quick, with settings outside Britain and magical schools that still feel believable.

** I've yet to read a fanfic that is as interesting and exciting as the canon books in terms of plot. There's a lot that are objectively well written in terms of language ( maybe even better than JK rowling) but almost none that are fast paced with a tightly written plot. There's almost always too much padding, or the story will lose it's plot halfway, the ending won't be good etc A lot of writers also don't get JK Rowling's humorous style of writing right.

Tbh I only read fanfics if I'm in the mood for my favourite romantic tropes or clichés +or smut+. A good plot is a plus of course. But Idc much for plot heavy/non romance fanfics cause most of them are very boring and dull.
