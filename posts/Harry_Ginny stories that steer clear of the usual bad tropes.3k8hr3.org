I'm looking for Harry/Ginny stories that follow these general criteria. You can also read it as a things-to-do-and-not-to-do list if you plan to write a Harry/Ginny story:

1.  Canon-ish characterizations: Harry and Ginny should be recognizably Harry and Ginny.

2.  No bashing. This means no manipulative Dumbledore. I don't care if you think it's canon. And this means no fics written by Brennus.

3.  Stay clear of the usual indy!Harry tropes. No super-wands and super-trunks, please.

4.  Ginny shouldn't be written solely as the damsel-in-distress. If the main plot is Ginny being kidnapped and Harry having to rescue her, please don't bother.

5.  Ginny should have agency of her own. She shouldn't require Harry's protection at every turn.

6.  Hate stories that make Ginny overly weepy. Cut that shit out, it is directly stated in canon that Ginny rarely cries. Oh, and no weepy abused Harry either.

7.  Three way relationships are fine, but no Harems.

8.  No twu luv right at the start. Keep the declarations of love for later. Exception if they start off in a relationship or married (see: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4101650/1/Backward-With-Purpose-Part-I-Always-and-Always][Backward with Purpose]]), but the true love thing still shouldn't be overplayed.

9.  Ginny shouldn't blush around Harry (or anyone, for that matter) past the age of thirteen.

10. No /"I've been in love with Harry Potter since I was eleven"/. And no /"I was dating Michael and Dean but I was really waiting for you to notice me"/ either. In case you couldn't tell, those are delusions of an overzealous shipper.

11. No virgin glorification either. If Ginny's past the age of twenty and still a virgin, that's a huge red flag right there.

12. I have a strange fondness for rom-coms. If you know any good ones, don't hesitate to rec them. But don't bring rom-com elements into an otherwise serious story.

13. Huge Bonus points if the fic manages to convey Ginny's sense of humor as written in the books. People forget that her humor can be rather biting at times. It is rare to find a fanfic that gets it right.

14. No Super-Harry or Super-Ginny. Canon-ish skill levels preferred.

15. Avoid anything overly angst-y. Justified angst is fine, but if the story starts off with too much angst, odds are that it is going to be bad.

16. Fics which aren't Harry/Ginny (yet, or otherwise), but possess excellent Harry/Ginny interactions (see: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6919395/1/The-Changeling][The Changeling]]) are welcome.

17. I don't mind it if the Harry/Ginny part is underplayed, but it should be at least of some significance. I don't think Taure's /The One He Feared/ would qualify, for instance.

18. Stories with strong plots are preferred, but I don't mind simple romances, even if I might have higher standards for them. I do love well written slice-of-life fics, so any recs there are welcome.

19. Bonus points for well written smut.

20. Bonus points for interesting premises, AUs and stories where Harry or Ginny (or both) are involved in unusual professions.

21. I have read my fair share for fics set immediately post DH, but most of them are very similar. Any recs for a story with this premise should have something that makes it stand out.

22. If there's Ginny POV, no long introspection on Ginny's part about how she got over her crush on Harry Potter, and now she sees him as a friend rather than a hero etc. That should be self evident, and the long introspection routine is tired and cliched.

23. Bonus points if the story showcases some of Ginny's less noticed talents, like her skills at impersonating voices ("/Hem, Hem"/) or her ability to lie convincingly (/"That's because it's colorless, but if you want to walk through it, carry on, then we'll have your body as proof for the next idiot who didn't believe us. . . .”/).

24. Don't rec stories that have Ginny always in the right and she always has the higher moral ground. Same for Harry. Bonus points if one or both main characters make genuinely stupid mistakes and are called out for it by other characters.

25. No Soul bonds. Thank you.

I doubt there are many stories that follow /all/ these rules, but they should be followed for most part. If any rec does break one or more of the above rules, please state which ones. If you think any of the rules are stupid, please mention why. Obscure recs are welcome, and are generally the best within the pairing. Novel length preferred, but I don't mind short stories or oneshots either.


** I actually have a list of around 35 Harry/Ginny stories that follow these rules for most part. I'll publish it here soon. Let's see whether I can get some unknown story recs out of this first.

**** Ah, OK, that makes sense. I knew there was something I was missing - I don't read a ton of H/G so I'm not that familiar with all of the tropes. Although I do think that it wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing if Ginny acts that way. It would be OOC, but that's OK in certain scenarios.

*** Harry's quite the exceptional boy, who is in constant danger. He needs a very strong character as a lover, and in canon, Ginny is that. However, some authors make Ginny a very shy, stammering and blushing girl who can't speak coherently in front of Harry and /still/ have Harry falling for her.

JKR makes it quite clear that Harry only starts having feelings for her when she's able to be herself around him (as in, a strong and confident girl).

That's what OP's getting at, I think.

** linkffn(Strangers at Drakeshaugh by Northumbrian) and linkffn(Backward with Purpose by Deadwoodpecker) are the classic H/G recs. Both authors have many other stories with the same pairing that are excellent.

linkffn(The Game is Afoot by Perspicacity) is another that satisfies your requirements. He wrote a few other Harry/Ginny stories (/Hallows and Pathos/ and /A Mother in Law's Love/, e.g.), but they fail in one or more places to meet your requirements (super wand in the case of the first, soul bonds in the case of the second).

**** Sheesh, I was reading a story yesterday that was decent up to the end. In the last paragraph of the last chapter, Harry needs to get rid of the Elder Wand and before you can say /deus ex machina/ Ollivander gifts him a magically glowing unicorn horn wand with basilisk fang core. Then new wand literally does the magical equivalent of a b!tch slap to the Elder Wand and claims Harry. The end. Problem solved. *EDITL* I also recommended /Strangers at Drakeshaugh/.

linkffn(Existence after Life by Cygnus Crux) and sequels linkffn(The Mind War by Cygnus Crux), linkffn(Union by Cygnus Crux), and linkffn(Wolf's Bane by Cygnus Crux). Published in 2002. It's been several years since I read them (they were among the first stories I read in the fandom), but I recall some pretty interesting worldbuilding.

The writing's a bit iffy for this one, and it admittedly delves into SuperHarry space, but it has a couple of good scenes (at least): linkffn(Harry Potter and the Dance of the Warrior by LordDragon73).

  Existence after Life by Cygnus Crux
#+end_quote

Read this last month actually. And yeah, you're right, they are interesting stories, and the expansion of the wizarding world is interesting. The plot is mostly good too, with Harry being replaced by the mirror version of him. That said, the story has some major issues. Ron's characterization is atrocious. The story reads like a Ron bashing fic at first, and then changes to hero!Ron halfway through. I believe the author was trying to portray him as a flawed but good person, but the start reads like a bad Harmony fic. And Ginny (who is Ginny in-name-only, for obvious reasons) falls in loooove with Malfoy in less than a week, despite it being obvious to everyone except her that Malfoy was an evil git. And the lengths the author goes to leave Ginny's virginity intact is hilarious.

So a decent story, but Ginny is one of the worst parts of the fic, so I would hesitate to rec it as a Harry/Ginny story. I haven't read the sequels, though I do intend to pick them up again at some point.

And as a side note, the number of exclamation marks used by the author made my eyes bleed.

As for old school HG fics, St Margarets's stuff comes to mind as excellent, especially [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?action=printable&textsize=0&sid=4384&chapter=all][Magic Within, Magic Without]]. Truly excellent romance writing, which reminds me that I have yet to read her most recent work. There's also [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=12077][The Phoenix and the Serpent]], which I maintain to be the objectively best fic in the fandom, even if it is a virtual unknown.

Never read Dance of the Warrior, but I'll look into it. Thanks for the rec.

** I'm currently writing DH from Ginny's POV and desperately trying to avoid all the tropes you mention because they bother me too. I'm quite a weepy person myself (NO SHAME) so that's the only one I'm struggling with, but I am keeping a close eye on it. I'm not throwing my fic into the reccomendations because it's not complete yet, but I imagine people reading this thread will be good at catching that stuff so if you fancy giving me some advice that would be appreciated. [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=129999][Not From Others]]

Otherwise, the best H/G stories I find are usually on SIYE, everyone there seems to have the characterisations pretty spot on. I like Bound and The Space Between by YelloWitchGirl although they can be a bit angsty. I also /LOVE/ These Cuts I Have by melindaleo but it is your standard post-DH, albeit more well written than usual.

** You sound like you've done a lot of homework on Harry/Ginny stories. I'm presuming that you've read the major H/G writers such as Northumbrian, little0bird, hgfan1111, deadwoodpecker,melindaleo etc. Let me see if I can come up with any obscure ones. Off the top of my head:

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1181280][Compromise:A Love Story]]: A sweet little one shot that captures the character of Ginny and her relationship with Harry beautifully.

Destiny Redefined- A different time-travel fic with the H/G relationship as the centerpiece of the story. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3928184/1/Destiny-Redefined]])

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7181871/1/Foolish][Foolish]] by Tonksaholic- This is a pretty Angsty story and I found it difficult to accept the premise of the story but it's superbly written. I'm sure that it'll break some of your rules but it's worth a read. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7181871/1/Foolish]])

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?chapterid=374833][Of Teacups and Teapots]] is a light hearted funny fic featuring both H/G and R/Hr. One of those rare fics which manage to be funny without descending into Crack.

[[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?sid=128876&textsize=0&chapter=1][Win a Date with Ginny Weasley]] and [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?sid=12536&textsize=0&chapter=1][The Best Mistake of my Life]] are H/G rom-coms. I'm not a big fan of the rom-com genre and hence not the best judge but I had a good time reading both these stories.

*** Thanks for the recs.

Compromise is awesome, and one of those stories which powerfully affects your head canon. Cwarbeck was the author who made me realize that I like rom-coms, so I am certainly familiar with /Win a Date with Ginny Weasley/. Destiny Redefined had some excellent plot twists that make the story worth reading, even though the action scenes are meh. I second all three.

Haven't read the rest, but I'll give them a try. /The Best Mistake of my Life/ sounds the most interesting, so that one's next.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1277839/1/Seeking-Ginny][Seeking Ginny]] was the story that got me hooked onto the H/G pairing. I'm not sure how well it's aged since it was written over 10 years ago. It requires a little bit of patience but it's worth the while.

** I completely understand that you're tired of all those poorly written H/G fics (honestly, I feel the same), but if you hold yourself to these 25 points very strictly, you'll probably miss a couple of good fics out there.

That being said, I can't wait for your list of good Harry/Ginny stories. I hope that there's some in there I haven't read yet!

My rec would probably be [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6473434/1/Unspeakable-Things][Unspeakable Things]]. It should cover most of your requirements, although a lot of the story does involve a very, very strong Harry and Ginny. Still, 20 out of 25 points (I think, do correct me if I'm wrong) is quite alright.

** I have one that I think would do it and I've only ever seen it here once. Mrs. Granger's Summer After the War and it's sequel Winters After the War. While these two are set immediate post war, and quite canon-compliant, I feel that the sheer quality of the author more than compensates. Summer is almost entirely dedicated to Harry and Ginny's relationship with some setup for Winters' Auror plotline. They do seem to move their relationship along a bit to fast in Summer, but they absolutely pay for their haste in Winters. Winters has two major focuses to it, Harry and the Aurors trying to find and capture all the Death Eaters & lackeys that escaped the final battle while Harry simultaneously has to try and become a fully trained Auror, a task that should take 2-3 years in half that time. This sounds pretty generic except the author frames it as a grand mystery, several Death Eaters have straight up vanished and are suspected to be conspiring together to do... something. The author handles the mystery very well, dropping hints and clues as to what the DEs are doing without giving it away and keeping you interested the whole way. The Harry/Ginny side of things is just as well written with their relationship still looking to be in the 'honeymoon stage' for a little while at first, then the first cracks start to show once they both enter the adult world. As the pressure from the Auror plotline and Ginny's new job as a Quidditch player mounts you can almost see the cracks slowly widening over the course of numerous chapters until the whole thing blows up in their faces (the entire Harry/Ginny section of the story is the embodiment of your 24th rule's bonus points part). All in all I think these stories are incredibly good and I could go on for pages about the excellent OCs and how they mesh with existing characters, how the author's depiction of other European magical societies is deeply interesting, or how almost all the new magic introduced felt like a great addition, but that'd be wasting space.

Anyway, heres the link to Summer:

Sorry for the wall o' text, I just really like Winters.

** Brennus' Homecoming, linkffn(11054843), is surprisingly entertaining. It took place a few years after Voldemort's defeat, Harry never went to Hogwarts, and the plot is really nice. It features Harry, Ginny, Tonks, Bill, and Hermione as main characters, and all of them are very much in character.

**** Heh. For some reason that cracked me up. Thanks, Wordhammer. I'll definitely give your story a read.

Brennus condenses all the worst elements of H/Hr fics into HG fics, which is why I dislike him. Ron Bashing, Dumbledore bashing, stereotypical Molly characterization, Muggle weaponry, One-sided relationships with the girl dominating (at least in /The Thorny Rose/). He could just write Ginny as a lovesick gold digger and complete the damn checklist.

Ironically, Brennus hates H/Hr shippers, and makes a point to run them down on his profile page. Not being a huge fan of H/Hr myself (which is more for the ubiquitous Weasley bashing than anything else), I might have reluctantly sympathized with him if he himself didn't read like an angry Harmonian who missed his lot in life.

Though to be fair to him, I've never read Homecoming. Who knows, it might even be readable, though I've definite cause to be skeptical.

***** Homecoming didn't have any bashing really. There was a semi-realistic look at Hermione and Ron's relationship, especially if Harry wasn't at Hogwarts, but it was mostly a minor side story. The story as a whole actually focused more on Tonks and Bill having a relationship and the friendship between Harry and Tonks. Harry and Ginny were there but kind of off to the side until near the end.

The only character I can really think of that was bashed was Fleur but it was kind of forced to explain the relationship between Tonks and Bill. I think my biggest problem with Brennus is his constant attempts to make Harry and Ginny dress and act like normal muggle teenagers and incorporate muggle tech, music, and fashions.
