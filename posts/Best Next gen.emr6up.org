Hey guys , please recommend me some good completed next gen fic (no slash please )🙏🏾


** I still believe linkao3(373224) is the best nextGen I know about. I have also tendency to return to [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/47462][Roses Trilogy]] and shockingly often I refer to linkao3(674219).

  Beginning immediately after the Epilogue, this story follows Scorpius, Rose and Albus through their Hogwarts years and beyond. Childish fears and desires soon turn to more serious dilemmas as some members of the Ravenclaw trio are forced to grow up too soon. Albus wants to be remembered for being something other than Harry Potter's son. Scorpius knows his father expects him to follow in his footsteps, but how long can he keep his friends, his music and his OWL in Muggle Studies a secret? And Rose has yet to decide what she wants...

** I love the TeaTime series by frombluetored, three stories, the last is a WIP. Set after CC, canon couples, lots of great OC's, although it does feature Scorbus, nothing graphic with them. And FloreatCastellum is currently posting a JSP centric story, Wood from the Trees. Both great writers in the Hinny fandom
