How and when did 'shopping trips' in Diagon Alley become a negative thing in the HP fan fiction community? I personally feel as though JKR could've explored Diagon Alley in more detail. For example, I find it unrealistic that we never saw a magical grocery store in Diagon Alley or any other restaurants really. IIRC we only saw Florean Fortescue's ice cream shop which always I thought was strange in such a supposedly busy area. In my experience whenever there's a bank (Gringotts in this case), a grocery store isn't far away. Surely the Leaky Cauldron isn't enough...wizards need more than pub food and ice cream...they need groceries too!

There must be many more shops and magical items than what Harry saw, yet if a fanfic author were to delve deeper and expand the wizarding world in their story through Diagon Alley it'd be viewed as cliché, boring, arrogant, etc. I've noticed that 'shopping sprees' have earned quite a bad reputation on this subreddit.

Do you personally nope out of a fic if the main character (usually Harry) spends quite a lot of time browsing Diagon Alley's shops or do you keep reading?


** There's ways of doing it without a standard shopping trip where Harry buys over powered items he doesn't need though.

Through crime/mystery, meeting someone, characters going to Diagon Alley for some other reason than the back to school shop, someone living there, etc.

In my stories I have had characters interviewing shop owners that have been robbed, having a burger and chips in the pub, going for nights out, meeting for coffee - I have extended the alley to be more like the high street in a standard British town, with small alleys coming off it and flats behind the shops. It's not strictly canon but no one has ever complained and I think as long as you don't go into too much detail it makes sense.

*** Yeah, it's not the fact that people hate Diagon, it's the obnoxious shopping trip with overpowered gear. I mean, I've written two shopping sprees myself, but both were under 1k words and neither included more than clothes for Harry. But there are only so many times before you start to roll your eyes whenever apartment trunks or multicore wands make an appearance.

Diagon itself is a good location because it allows you all kinds of scenarios, from a simple lunch to shady dealers or a secret meeting place above a random store.

** Most of the complaining is about the trips which are just either a tick off a checklist, so add nothing new at all, and are actually so boring, you know it's going to be Gringotts (Oh! Griphook! With maybe a side of "You remembered my name! You're the best human to live since forever!"), Madam Malkin's with Malfoy, Ollivanders, picking up Hedwig, etc. I don't need to read that for the millionth time.

Otherwise, it's a way to make Harry OP easily. I don't have a problem with the alley itself, like with so many other cliches, it's just that it's so overdone and boring.

As for how canon described it, do you honestly believe an eleven year old is going to notice something as mundane as grocery stores when there's actual magic around? Of course the ice cream shoppe is the one he notices, and that's just how it should be. Mentioning such things which one should be able to infer by themselves unnecessarily slows the story down and adds a lot of clutter, and it pulls interest from the places you want there to be.

Good point. I do think that Diagon Alley still should have been described in more detail though, particularly as Harry got older and magic became less exotic to him. I just feel like it was a missed opportunity for Rowling to limit the number of shops to mainly school supplies. IMO the presence of Gringotts bank implies that there should be more everyday life shop items in the vicinity.

In any case the fact that there are almost certainly other shops in Diagon Alley than just the ones that Harry visits/recollects is plenty of proof to understand that "absence of evidence is not evidence of absence" is correct.

We never saw any grocery store because Harry was there for back-to-school shopping. No need to visit a grocery store for that.

**** Also, what exactly are magical groceries? For the most part, all the "sustenance"-type food we see is muggle food, and magic lets you make more food once you have some but is otherwise mostly shown in sweets. The Weasley's live in Devon and could easily do their shopping locally. I could see enchanted cakes or whatever at Diagon, but that's more specialized, i.e. a bakery, rather than a grocer.

So we're not expecting a big "store" groceries, i.e. stuff like magical herbs and whatnot are bought at the apothecary or potions store or something. And there's really not much unique stuff for street grocers to sell. The closest we have to a magical vegetable is Luna's dirigible plums, which are grown in a home garden.

The problem is that the vast majority of authors don't. Expand the magical world, I mean. Instead it's the same checklist of tired bullshit everyone's seen a billion times: Trip to the bank where Harry inevitably impresses the entire Goblin nation with his amazing ability to remember names.

** I'm ok with it. But like with everything, it really depends on how it's done, and more importantly what use it has to the story.

We don't see it on canon because of the protagonists, but these shops have to exist right?? I mean, kids go to ice cream shops and school supply shops, adults go grocery shopping and stuff. So there's probably lots of shops we might not even be aware exist.

I love it when fics at least hint that things are bigger than what we see. The Pureblood Pretense in particular is a favorite of mine in the way it deals with Knockturn Alley.

** To be honest the three main problems I have with DA trips are the following

1. Harry buying magically OP items that will never ever come up again the text. Ever. (i.e new "edgy" wands, infinite bag storage, live-in trunks, ect.) This isn't an RPG where the goal is to get as much fancy shit as possible. Maybe if Harry stumbled upon ONE interesting thing, and even then it shouldn't be something too left field, then that might make for an interesting story, as long as the object is used for longer than half a chapter.
2. The culmination of the Goblin nation (who really hate even the nice wizards) figuratively sucking the dick of Harry because he's not an asshole. Also, Griphook isn't the only goblin to exist and Ragnarok is such a generic name now for the goblin manager that I now play a game where I try to guess the name of the bank manager before he is even introduced (hint: it's always ragnarok!)
3. Goddamn barbie trips. "Oh yes I want acromantula silk robes with silver/green highlights and I want dragon leather shoes and a cape and-" blah blah blah! All these boring, dumb and overused clothing combinations mean virtually nothing to the story and only take up space. It makes me immediately click off the story.

I'll stop my bitching, but yeah, that's why I hate many DA trips.

Diagon Alley is like the children's sector of a multiplex. All the fun wonder stuff. speedy brooms and cute animals, Creepy old men selling wands.\\
Knockturn Alley... It's more "adult" oriented. They can leave their kids in the children space safely. Then shop for groceries and other adult stuff in their section. Things like magical imports, buying dangerous creatures, inns might be there in that place.

I love reading new and weird stuff that expands on canon. And I only "nope out" of the fic, when the MC enters the alley with huge amounts of galleons or acquires the "magical wallet/pouch". But there are quite a few "guilty pleasure" fics, where I'll read through it.

** Browsing the shops and expanding the universe while in Diagon alley isn't what I would look down on during a shopping trip. I would look down on is if the character shows off how much money they can afford to spend and buys a whole bunch of objects that would have broken the plot of the original books. The character would also have to be certain and sure that they want to spend such a huge amount of money on a really extravagant, and sometimes really tacky looking, object, even though they have just learned about it's existence, and the magic that makes it possible on that very day.

I've read fics in the past that are set in Diagon Alley, either part of the time or the whole time. When the alley and the allies that might branch off from it, is treated like a neighborhood of magic in the middle of the bustle of London, I find it really charming.

** I completely skipped passed the Diagon Alley trip in my story. It just doesn't enough and is so by-the-numbers at this point that it felt pointless for me to write it. Just skip to the Hogwarts Express and people can fill in the rest themselves.

** Yeah I disagree with the negative sentiment too. As long as they're not just rehashing the same places but adding new places/people to see I think its fun.

** I actually got kind of worried about that. In fact, I was so worried that I'd lose readers of linkffn(We, Harry Potter by wille179) that in an early version of one of my later chapters, I had an author's note urging people to keep reading it. I wanted to set up for something bigger, but the initial setup looked a lot like many other "Harry goes to Diagon Alley" chapters and I was worried they'd drop the story before they got to the part where Harry was slightly dumb and Murphy's law shit on him for his innocent mistake.

I deleted the note two hours later, but I still think about it.

  Down in the Chamber of Secrets, as Harry was dying from the basilisk venom, something awoke within his blood that began changing him, body, mind, and soul. The destruction of the horcrux in his head kicked that process in the metaphorical balls. Now, what are Harry, Harry, Harry, Harry, and Harry to do as a literal five-headed dragon? (some fluff, no bashing, not power wank.)

** I really wonder if the magical community has "grocery stores" in the sense that muggles do? I tend to think they're a little more behind the times and maybe would have, like, a butcher's, a baker's, the candy shop, etc. And maybe grow a lot of their own vegetables in gardens if they own a house, or trade with/pay their neighbors who do.

I know in the USA, a "general store" was the source of most drygoods in the pioneer days, but I'm not sure what the UK equivalent for those times would be.

It's also my headcanon that a great deal of Hogsmeade residents supply food to Hogwarts as their main or supplemental source of income. Gardens, chickens, pigs, beef, milk, wheat or bread, etc. We know Hagrid has a garden with a pumpkin patch but surely he can't be doing it all by himself, especially with his other duties, and the books make no mention of house elves working in a castle garden, nor do the maps show any sign of one.
