** Like linkffn(Growing Up Black) ! One of my favorite fics, sadly abandoned. Although I have to say the way they wrote their hiatus notice is the most impressive one I've read yet(referring to the author's depression by using Dementors? So creative!)

  What if Harry had been rescued from the Dursleys at age six and raised as the heir of the Noble and Most Ancient, etc.? This is the weird and wonderful story of Aries Sirius Black. AU. Part I complete. Part II complete. (Warning: Part II ends on a cliffhanger. If you dislike that fact, Part II, Chapter 35, might be a better place to stop reading.) Part III is on indefinite hiatus.
