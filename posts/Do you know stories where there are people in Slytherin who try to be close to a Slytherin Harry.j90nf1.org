Just that they don't all hate him or all love him. There should be (older, in his year and younger,) students who hate his guts or just don't care about him and also those who see the power of his influence in the world and try to become friends so they also have some influence or have protection from other people. They could also teach him how politics and the wizarding world in general works.


** I feel like linkao3(souls touch, and the future changes) and its sequel linkao3(right under their noses) may be what you're looking for?

Edit: the bot got the wrong one, here's the link [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24096307/chapters/58001593]]

  Albus Dumbledore watched two visionaries start as driven, powerful, brilliant young men, and become monsters. He has no heir, no protege of equal power to step in should another one rise, and he is old. So when he hears of a Chosen One with power the Dark Lord knows not, he thinks maybe he doesn't want this boy prophesied to defeat Lord Voldemort to grow up in the Wizarding world. He thinks of the bonds of family, and the opportunity he has to shape his world's politics, and of a corrupt magical elite who've signed on with two Dark Lords over hatred of Muggles. He thinks Harry Potter should grow up loved by his family, and Voldemort be destroyed so there is no need for Harry to ever realize his power, and he acts to make both of those things happen. Because he's Dumbledore and what he wants, he gets. Usually. When you dabble with improvised ritual magic, you should be aware there might be unforeseen consequences. For example: souls touch.
