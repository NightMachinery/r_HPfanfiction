I often wonder what the nature of Dark Magic is according to canon. In fanfics it's often addictive or gives the wizard a rush or wizards and witches are born as either dark or light. Obviously all of this is not canon.

I haven't read the books back to back in quite some time, but I tried to put together a few quotes on the Dark Arts that could show what JKR intended them to be.

Fake Moody's DADA lesson on the Unforgivables, GoF, Ch 14:

#+begin_quote
  He [Moody] gave a harsh laugh, and then clapped his gnarled hands together.

  "So - straight into it. Curses. They come in many strengths and forms. Now, according to the Ministry of Magic, I'm supposed to teach you *countercurses* and leave it at that.

  [...]

  Moody was speaking again, from a great distance, it seemed to Harry. With a massive effort, he pulled himself back to the present and listened to what Moody was saying.

  "Avada Kedavra's a curse that *needs a powerful bit of magic behind it - you could all get your wands out now and point them at me and say the words, and I doubt I'd get so much as a nosebleed.* But that doesn't matter. I'm not here to teach you how to do it."
#+end_quote

Bellatrix's often quoted remark, OotP, Ch 36:

#+begin_quote
  'Come out, come out, little Harry!' she called in her mock baby voice, which echoed off the polished wooden floors. 'What did you come after me for, then? I thought you were here to avenge my dear cousin!'

  'I am!' shouted Harry, and a score of ghostly Harry's seemed to chorus I am! I am! I am! all around the room.

  'Aaaaaah . . . did you love him, little baby Potter?

  Hatred rose in Harry such as he had never known before; he flung himself out from behind the fountain and bellowed, 'Crucio!'

  Bellatrix screamed: the spell had knocked her off her feet, but she did not writhe and shriek with pain as Neville had - she was already back on her feet, breathless, no longer laughing. Harry dodged behind the golden fountain again. Her counter-spell hit the head of the handsome wizard, which was blown off and landed twenty feet away, gouging long scratches into the wooden floor.

  'Never used an Unforgivable Curse before, have you, boy?' she yelled. She had abandoned her baby voice now. *'You need to mean them, Potter! You need to really want to cause pain - to enjoy it - righteous anger won't hurt me for long* - I'll show you how it is done, shall I? I'll give you a lesson - '
#+end_quote

Snape's famous speech as newly appointed DADA teacher, HBP, Ch 9:

#+begin_quote
  Snape set off around the edge of the room, speaking now in a lower voice; the class craned their necks to keep him in view. The Dark Arts," said Snape, "are many, varied, ever-changing, and eternal. Fighting them is like fighting a many-headed monster, which, each time a neck is severed, sprouts a head even fiercer and cleverer than before. You are fighting that which is unfixed, mutating, indestructible."

  Harry stared at Snape. It was surely one thing to respect the Dark Arts as a dangerous enemy, another to speak of them, as Snape was doing, with a loving caress in his voice?

  "Your defenses," said Snape, a little louder, "must therefore be as flexible and inventive as the arts you seek to undo.[...]"
#+end_quote

Confrontation between Harry and Malfoy, HBP, Ch 24:

#+begin_quote
  "No! No! Stop it!" squealed Moaning Myrtle, her voice echoing loudly around the tiled room. "Stop! STOP!" There was a loud bang and the bin behind Harry exploded; Harry attempted a Leg-Locker Curse that backfired off the wall be-hind Malfoy's ear and smashed the cistern beneath Moaning Myr-tle, who screamed loudly; water poured everywhere and Harry slipped as Malfoy, his face contorted, cried, "Cruci ---"

  "SECTUMSEMPRA!" bellowed Harry from the floor, waving his wand wildly.

  Blood spurted from Malfoy's face and chest as though he had been slashed with an invisible sword. He staggered backward and collapsed onto the waterlogged floor with a great splash, his wand falling from his limp right hand.

  "No ---" gasped Harry.

  Slipping and staggering, Harry got to his feet and plunged toward Malfoy, whose face was now shining scarlet, his white hands scrabbling at his blood-soaked chest.

  "No --- I didn't ---"

  Harry did not know what he was saying; he fell to his knees beside Malfoy, who was shaking uncontrollably in a pool of his own blood. Moaning Myrtle let out a deafening scream: "MURDER! MURDER IN THE BATHROOM! MURDER!"

  The door banged open behind Harry and he looked up, terrified: Snape had burst into the room, his face livid. Pushing Harry roughly aside, he knelt over Malfoy, drew his wand, and traced it over the deep wounds Harry's curse had made, muttering an incantation that sounded almost like song. The flow of blood seemed to ease; Snape wiped the residue from Malfoy's face and repeated his spell. Now the *wounds seemed to be knitting.* Harry was still watching, horrified by what he had done, barely aware that he too was soaked in blood and water. Moaning Myrtle was still sobbing and wailing overhead. When Snape had performed his countercurse for the third time, he half-lifted Malfoy into a standing position.

  "You need the hospital wing. There may be a *certain amount of scarring,* but if you take dittany immediately we might avoid even that.. . . Come...."

  [...]

  Snape returned ten minutes later. He stepped into the bathroom and closed the door behind him. "Go," he said to Myrtle, and she swooped back into her toilet at once, leaving a ringing silence behind her. *"I didn't mean it to happen,"* said Harry at once. His voice echoed in the cold, watery space. "I didn't know what that spell did." But Snape ignored this. "Apparently I underestimated you, Potter," he said quietly. "Who would have thought you knew such Dark Magic? Who taught you that spell?"

A few quotes from DH:

Harry leaves Privet Drive, Fred loses his ear, Ch 5:

#+begin_quote
  Harry, give us a hand!" called Hagrid hoarsely from the door, in which he was stuck again. Glad of something to do, Harry pulled him free, the headed through the empty kitchen and back into the sitting room, where Mrs. Weasley and Ginny were still tending to George. Mrs. Weasley had staunched his bleeding now, and by the lamplight Harry saw a clean gaping hole where George's ear had been.

  "How is he?"

  Mrs. Weasley looked around and said, "I can't make it grow back, not when it's been removed by Dark Magic. But it could've been so much worse.... He's alive."

  "Yeah," said Harry. "Thank God."
#+end_quote

Harry using the Imperius Curse for the first time when they steal the cup from Gringotts, in Ch 26:

#+begin_quote
  "Act now, act now," whispered Griphook in Harry's ear, "the Imperious Curse!"

  Harry raised the hawthorn wand beneath the cloak, pointed it at the old goblin, and whispered, for the first time in his life, "Imperio!"

  A *curious sensation shot down Harry's arm, a feeling of tingling, warmth that seemed to flow from his mind, down the sinews and veins connecting him to the wand and the curse it had just cast.* The goblin took Bellatrix's wand, examined it closely, and then said, "Ah, you have had a new wand made, Madam Lestrange!"

  "What?" said Hermione, "No, no, that's mine¨--"

  "A new wand?" said Travers, approaching the counter again; still the goblins all around were watching. "But how could you have done, which wandmaker did you use?"

  Harry acted without thinking. Pointing his wand at Travers, he muttered, "Imperio!" once more.

  "Oh yes, I see," said Travers, looking down at Bellatrix's wand, "yes, very handsome. and is it working well? I always think wands require a little breaking in, don't you?"

  [...]

  "We're in trouble; they suspect," said Harry as the door slammed behind them and he pulled off the Invisibility Cloak. Griphook jumped down from his shoulders: neither Travers nor Bogrod showed the slightest surprise at the sudden appearance of Harry Potter in their midst. "They're Imperiused," he added, in response to Hermione and Ron's confused queries about Travers and Bogrod, who were both now standing there looking blank. *"I don't think I did it strongly enough, I don't know ..."*

  And another memory darted through his mind, of the real Bellatrix Lestrange shrieking at him when he had first tried to use an Unforgivable Curse: *"You need to mean them, Potter!"*

  "What do we do?" asked Ron. "Shall we get out now, while we can?"

  "If we can," said Hermione, looking back toward the door into the main hall, beyond which who knew what was >happening.

  "We've got this far, I say we go on," said Harry.

  "Good!" said Griphook. "So, we need Bogrod to control the cart; I no long have the authority. But there will not be room for the wizard."

  Harry pointed his wand at Travers.

  "Imperio!"

  The wizard turned and set off along the dark track at a smart pace.

  "What are you making him do?"

  "Hide," said Harry as he pointed his wand at Bogrod, who whistled to summon a little cart that came trundling along the tracks toward them out of the darkness."
#+end_quote

Ch 30, Harry back at Hogwarts, when Amycus Carrow spat at McGonagall:

#+begin_quote
  "It's not a case of what you'll permit, Minerva McGonagall. Your time's over. It's us what's in charge here now, and you'll back me up or you'll pay the price."

  And he spat in her face.

  Harry pulled the Cloak off himself, raised his wand, and said, "You shouldn't have done that."

  As Amycus spun around, Harry shouted, "Crucio!"

  The Death Eater was lifted off his feet. He writhed through the air like a drowning man, thrashing and howling in pain, and then, with a crunch and a shattering of glass, he smashed into the front of a bookcase and crumpled, insensible, to the floor. *"I see what Bellatrix meant," said Harry, the blood thundering through his brain, "you need to really mean it."*

  "Potter!" whispered Professor McGonagall, clutching her heart. "Potter -- you're here! What--? How--?" She struggled to pull herself together. "Potter, that was foolish!"

  "He spat at you," said Harry.

  "Potter, I ¨-- that was very ¨-- gallant of you ¨-- but don't you realize ¨--?"

  "Yeah, I do," Harry assured her. Somehow her panic steadied him. "Professor McGonagall, Voldemort's on the way."
#+end_quote

So, that's all the quotes I could come up with, maybe you know more?

Because of these quotes to me it seems that:

- for the Cruciatus to work you indeed have to "want to cause pain". (After successfully casting the Cruciatus for the first time, Harry said he knew what Bellatrix meant)

- you need power to cast the Killing Curse. JKR rarely talks about magic as measurably in power, it's more about knowledge and skill, so how do you interpret this quote?

- Harry thinks his Imperius is weak. Is this because he didn't "mean it" strongly enough? What do you make of this scene?

- Harry using Sectumsempra shows us, that you don't always have to *"mean it"* for Dark Magic to work. He had no idea what this curse would do, so he couldn't really want the result. Or do you think his anger at Malfoy counts as "meaning it"?

- Certain Dark Curses are difficult to heal and leave scars if not treated immediately (Malfoy)

- Molly can't regrow Fred's ear because it has been removed with Dark Magic.

Can you come up with more quotes? What do you think is Dark Magic according to canon? What defines it?

Edit: After reading redarrow420's and Liazas' answers, I have two more questions:

- Do you think Harry's Sectumsempra worked on Malfoy as intended, or do you think it was weaker because Harry didn't "mean it"? Personally I always thought it worked as intended. IMO healing was possible because no extremities were severed (as opposed to Fred's ear). I think no extremities were severed not because the curse was weaker, but because Harry's curse caught Malfoy's upper body, which is not as easily severed as an ear. They could close Fred's wound, just like Snape closed Malfoy's. Only regrowing the lost ear was impossible.

- Is there a difference between "normal" magic and dark magic? Do you need to "mean" a levitating charm on the same level as you need to mean the Cruciatus?


** Out of them, the Sectumsempra seems not to fit, as the rest of the time, the casters frame of mind, their "really meaning it" is emphasised, but there Harry casts the spell without knowing what it did. Perhaps Snape is over exaggerating how Dark that spell is? Or perhaps the intent component is specific only to the Unforgiveables?

As an aside, I've never liked that scene from DH where Harry uses the Cruciatus Curse on Carrow, both Harry and McGonagall felt quite OOC in it. I mean, I can almost excuse Harry's liberal use of the Imperius curse earlier in the book as being tactically necessary, but throwing out the torture curse like that, /and apparently really meaning it/, just because McGonagall got spat on is way out of order. McGonagall's reaction, along with everyone else's, seems totally blasé and not in line with how we are supposed to feel about the use of the torture curse. Harry's use of Sectumsempra is narratively justified by the fact that Draco was about to use the torture curse on Harry, for example.

*** I think Harry could have "meant it" because right before this scene Neville told him how the Carrows tortured him and other students and even made students practice the Cruciatus on other students who got detention. So I guess he was already quite angry before seeing this scene.

I agree that it seems as if "meaning it" only applied to the unforgivables, or possibly only the Cruciatus as there is no mention of Harry "meaning it" when he used the Imperius (although his speculation that his Imperius was weak because he didn't "mean it" casts doubt on that assumption)

** I don't think there's really a difference between Dark Magic and any other type from the information we have. I belive that all magic must be "meant", it's just usually easier to want to levitate a feather than to provoke pain to a sentient creature. The Sectumsempra Harry used didn't work as intended because he didn't know the effects: I think that he just wanted to "attack" and not to "sever" so the spell was weakened by that.

** In terms of sectumsempra you could state that "meaning it" did mitigate the spell, since we know that dark magic can be irreparable (George's ear), yet Snape is able to quickly save Malfoy, and suggests that even scarring (from a large wound across the torso) could be avoided. Therefore it could be argued that the lack of "meaning" behind Harry's curse lead to a less severe result.

*** Thanks for the answer! About Fawkes, is it canon that phoenixes don't like dark wizards? Or just something that was mentioned so often in fanfics that it almost seems like canon? (Like the tempus charm, for some time I thought it was canon because it's mentioned in so many fics...) I also want to explore dark magic, but I wanted to have an idea of its nature in canon and go from there to make my personal headcanon of it as close to canon as possible.

I'm also not sure if it really has an effect on the soul, as in corrupting it just because a wizard uses it. Does killing/torturing through dark magic corrupt a person more than doing the same things through non-magical means?

Voldemort's appearance is explained as being the result of his corruption through dark magic, if I remember correctly, but then it could only be the result of splitting his soul and not the effect dark magic generally has on people. (does that make sense?)

It makes sense that dark magic can be addictive because it's powerful, the same way any feeling power can be addictive, I just have issue with those fics that make the addiction seem like a drug addiction or something, where the wizard needs to cast dark magic or suffer withdrawals.

I like your explanation about dark wizards, because you attribute it to a frame of mind and not an inclination to certain magics. I think this also fits well with the "mean it" part of the cruciatus - you need to be in a certain frame of mind to be able to want people to suffer that much.

As far as I know there is only one shield charm in canon - protego - and then there a varieties of this one charm. If we assume that the nature of dark magic isn't any different than that of normal magic - all of it is driven by knowledge, skill, wand movements, incantations and intent - then there's also no need for a dark shield charm. Dark would then only describe the malevolent kind of magic, just be one part of the bigger picture.

I think Snape's quote fits the way dark magic is used in canon perfectly, actually. The word "monster" indicates that it is something dangerous and malicious that only seeks to destroy and hurt - just the way we saw it applied in canon. and the /"each time a neck is severed, sprouts a head even fiercer and cleverer than before"/ part sounds just what Voldemort did with dark magic. Pushing it's boundaries, discovering things (multiple horcruxes) that were believed impossible before, that make him even more wicked and harder to destroy.

** I think that "Dark Magic" in canon was simply the prejudiced view of the ignorant wizard-kind equating Dark to mean Evil. The entirety of Hogwarts's studentry was convinced that Harry was evil due to his Parseltongue ability, which was notoriously regarded as a "dark" skill.

Pertaining to the unhealable nature of "dark magic": I think it is merely that wizarding healing is unable to regrow body parts, nothing to do with the nature of spell that removed them. Moody had a replacement leg and eye, and George's ear was never replaced. Pettigrew on the other hand (ha!), had his hand replaced with a conjured silver one, and he lost his hand from a simple knife, no magic involved.

*** I always thought Moody's eye and leg were probably the result of a dark curse during the first war or his Auror duty and couldn't be regrown because of that. I think Molly's statement strongly suggests that principally it is possible, otherwise it just wouldn't make much sense for Molly to say what she said, but she explicitly adds that the ear can't be regrown because it severed by dark magic. I think that means something.

About wormtail: Seeing as I think that body parts can be regrown, my theory is that Voldemort could have given Wormtail his normal hand, but wanted a means to control him, after all his silver hand did kill him the moment his loyalty to Voldemort was at risk.

I don't think there's a canon answer to this, so you're kind of diving into fanon and headcanon.

In my worldbuilding, yes, you have to "mean" a levitating charm. More accurately for a simple charm like that, you have to /believe/ in it. The real key is the unhesitating knowledge that when you wave your wand around and say the words the feather will float.

I like this as an idea, but it is directly contradicted by canon multiple times, e.g. Harry using Sectumsempra without knowing what it did, or Flitwick's warning to the kids in the first book about the story of the wizard Baruffio:

#+begin_quote
  "Swish and flick, remember, swish and flick. And saying the magic words properly is very important, too --- never forget Wizard Baruffio, who said 's' instead of 'f' and found himself on the floor with a buffalo on his chest."

In fact for me that story, and what it implies about magical theory, is one the least used but most fascinating bits of canon.

**** Well, mine is very AU, so it doesn't really matter, but I don't think it /has/ to be a contradiction. In my version of magic the incantations and specific wand movements are like... teaching aids. Young witches and wizards are taught to associate magical effects with a fixed set of actions as it's an easier way to start teaching them magic. The majority of adults in this setting never progress much beyond that either, except for some non-verbal casting.

And for common spells, the wand motions and words actually are important because my version of magic is... "malleable" in a way. The repeated association of actions with effects over the course of centuries has caused magic to respond to them as much as to intent. Intent plays a much bigger role in spell creation and the kind of free form casting the likes of Dumbledore or Voldemort might do but is beyond the average witch or wizard.

***** I think I've seen this kind of interpretation before, where repeated castings sort of cause the magic to run down certain channels, like how a river will wear away at rock over time, causing the rivers route to become more fixed. I really like it as it neatly ties together both wanded, incantation based magic and accidental magic nicely.

Is it your intent that the more popular a spell is, the easier it get to cast/ the less power it takes/ the more likely it is to have the intended effect or something similar? It seems like something like this should be the natural consequence of magic working in this particular way.

******* Interesting - one common trope in magical fantasy is that of the old, lost, super powerful magic, but this regime almost seems to suggest that if a spell gets lost then it will fall behind (in terms of usage, and therefore power?) other spells. Hence the most powerful spells should be the ones that everyone knows and uses.

This is true for the average person. For those who grok magic, like Dumbledore or Voldemort, they become unnecessary as they're mostly able to cast based on pure intent. There are still limits to what they can accomplish, though. Their own imagination, the amount of power they can put into a spell without exhausting or killing themselves, etc.
