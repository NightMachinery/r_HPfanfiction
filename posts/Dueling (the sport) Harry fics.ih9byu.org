Fics where Harry duels, preferably w lots of OCs as I imagine most of the competition is foreign, although that isn't a requirement. Long fics preferred but all welcome


** This fic might interest you, it has Harry training Daphne for some international tournament. Harry also has duels with some OCs. linkffn(13191213)

  GoF AU. Harry was raised by the Flamel's and brought up to grow to his fullest potential. That means legendary dueling skills, and an immense amount of knowledge to make him a proud Ravenclaw when his name is entered into the Goblet of Fire and draws him out of hiding. Pairing Harry/Daphne. Neville plays the best friend and a major role in the story. Powerful Harry, but not OP.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12863363/1/Path-to-Power]] - this is rarely recommended but there is a focus on duelling in this story. It's a great fanfic as well.
