I know this is a really cliché ask, but I have a huge golden trio itch centred around time travel/alternate universe. I've looked for some fics myself, but couldn't find any good ones, so I was wondering if anyone has recommendations.

I don't care about the fic in general, whether it's crack, dark, gen, slash, femslash, het - it doesn't matter. I feel like the majority of these fics are incomplete, so I'm not bothered if it's abandoned or completed.

I don't really mind the era's, however I've always stayed clear of the Founder's Era, because authors sometimes don't portray them well, but if anyone has any great Founder's fics, I'm up to try them.

I also don't mind if the golden trio is accompanied by others (a couple have Ginny, Luna and even sometimes Draco). Thanks for helping.


** There's one where the trio ends up time traveling (with baby Rose in tow) to their first year of Hogwarts. It gets weird though but it was a fun read. I'll see if I can find it

  Rose is just born and Al is due. But after finding an ancient mirror, Harry, Ron, Hermione and baby Rose are sent back into their 11-year-old bodies the night before they first met. Trapped in the past and wary of the Wizarding World, they seek to kill Voldemort as soon as possible. Together Harry, Ron and Hermione shall show the past who the Golden Trio really are.

Absolutely amazing portrayal of founders, really shows how Slytherin and Gryffindor were best friends and gives a Canon compliant(ish up to book 6 anyways) explanation of Salazar leaving, only downside is that it was published in 2012 and chapter 28 was uploaded in February and I can already tell that the end in chapter 31(or the projected end anyways) will leave me hungry to start the sequel (which the author has already confirmed is in the works)

/Something happened in the hours after the final battle, after the evacuation of the living and the dead. As the last of the survivors left the castle, and as the castle itself turned its wounded back on them all. The loss of Hogwarts has been felt by their entire community. And it's something that needs to be put right./

Harry knows there's nothing he can do to stop Hermione (war hero, historian, author of the reissued “Hogwarts: A History”) once she sets her mind to something. Even an extremely risky last-ditch effort to restore the ancient castle and lay its newest ghosts to rest. What he wasn't counting on was her insistence that Draco Malfoy be part of the plan.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter decides he is not happy with his lot after the war has ended. He decides he needs to go back in time to fix it. Only, he neglects to tell Ron and Hermione.It seemed like a good idea at the time.Ron, Hermione, and Harry go back to the Marauders' fifth year to help change the outcome of the war.They didn't think it through very well.

What Souls are Made Of by Emeralds_and_lilies

It's a current favorite of mine. It is Tomarry and their relationship is written very believable. Not completed but still updates pretty regularly.

Summary:

A mysterious object in Bellatrix's vault sends Harry, Ron and Hermione spinning into the past and to a Hogwarts like none they know.

Posing as students, Harry catches the eye of the Head Boy, Tom Riddle, who is nothing like the Voldemort of the future. He's charming and sly and manipulative; both brillant and deadly. He has the entire school wrapped around his finger.

Only Harry has no plans to save him. In fact, he's going to kill him.
