Maybe for like, safety have it so hogwarts starts later so he is 18. And for extra comedic value make it so he is just, huge if you catch my drift to the point that noone is talking about if he cheated anymore.


** McGonagall spends the entire tournament frantically transfiguring and animating elaborate displays to tastefully cover Harry's junk, after trying to get him to see reason after the Weighing of the Wands and realizing she has no leverage.

No, that'll make him an adult exhibitionist, and more liable for prosecution. If he's underage, then his guardian would be responsible for his behaviour. And that's Sirius Black, a Marauder and outside the reach of the law.

Screw "safety", it's no worse than time-traveling adults having relationships with underage children.

*** Is Sirius Black actually his guardian? I would have assumed that after being put in Azkaban it would have been stripped from him. The Dursleys are his official guardian's anyway.

In any case since they are at a boarding school, and anyway from any normal guardian, the responsibility would probably fall to Professor Mcgonagall, his house head.

Not sure how she'd handle it, apart from being extremely disappointed

******* in fanfiction there are different categories. some are strict canon where events dont deviate like if you were to write a story about a scene between events or from another point of view than the usual (like if you wrote the story of how Barty Jr and his mom traded places in detail and wrote out the thoughts and feelings of Barty's mom in her last days...it's estabished what happened but Rowling doesn't give details, you could write those details and stay in canon). then there are those that try to follow the basic rules of the universe and follow what some call "in characterness" but deviate from established events which is what i'm guessing is what youre imagining...but strictly speaking these stories are not canon because events are already moving off track. then there are whole hosts of concepts of alternate universe where, if you're careful, you can move pretty far from canon and "in character" behavior to explore different possibilities. marvel comics famously did it with their own stuff with a series of comics called "what if..." which itself was hit or miss in quality. this story could go either way. it depends on how far reaching you think Harry's choice to do this would be. I can see the value of strictly in canon fanfiction, but the best stories i've read in fanfiction haven't been afraid to ask, hey! what if...

** There was one that I can't find right now, a one shot or part of a series of one shots, in which Harry deliberately breaks the deep or fundamental rules of Hogwarts, to escape being in the Tournament (IIRC). McGonagall realizes what he's doing and begs Dumbledore to stop him before he went below number 10...at which point he did, as rule 2 or 3 is not going skyclad. She moans something along the lines of "now that they've all seen him" the girls will be chasing him and causing disruption. He is finally excused from whatever and therefore resumes normal behavior. Thought it was by Clell, but can't seem to find it.
