** This happens in my story (please forgive the shameless self-promotion). I love Neville AND Ron, so they're both part of Harry's circle of friends.

#+begin_quote
  Harry's 4th year at Hogwarts ended in tragedy. Now, as he faces a world darkened by Voldemort's return, he must cling to those he loves more than ever. Struggling with his guilt, Harry resolves to work harder so that he can protect others from Cedric's fate. Follow a slightly sadder Harry through a different fifth year at Hogwarts as he deals with an evil pink-clad professor, a mysterious connection to Voldemort, and the very real trauma of his past.
