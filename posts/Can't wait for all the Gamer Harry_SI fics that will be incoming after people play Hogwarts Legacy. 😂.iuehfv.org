2021 is gonna be crazy with new fics (not just gamer ones hopefully though) when people play the game and refresh their interest in the Series. Well, unless the game sucks...but my hype won't allow for such sacrilege 😂✌️

*** I can't stand that genre because for some reason the authors always choose to use the worst aspects from video games, namely grinding, for their stories. I get that you want to show that a character gets stronger, but IMO a Mass Effect like approach where you get XP for completed quests/levels rather than on enemy kill would be way smoother to read.

****** Most games have different enemy types early and late though, which is an issue if your plot has the same enemy all the time. If Harry can deal with Death Eaters in chapter 3, meeting them in chapter 40 is honestly a waste of words. And there are not many Death Eaters who'd make a good boss. I certainly can't see Lucius play the part (outside of a tutorial level at least).

********* Never said we had to make up OC bosses. You could just raise the competency of the top Death Eaters and other main antagonists. Take what Taure did to Lockhart in Victoria Potter. He's more competent and would make a great boss, while still being recognisably himself. As for the death count, you could make the mechanics of the game encourage mostly defeating threats non-lethally or stop them before they're killed (because they're arrested or something else). If they get arrested it also allows them to power-up later too for rematches. As for the usual fodder enemies in games, you could expand the population of Magical Britain. Instead of just like 40 students per year, increase it greatly. Have millions of witches and wizards. And then the canon characters can be made more important for some reason or another. It doesn't have to feel cheap.

*********** You can raise the competency of the good guys too. And you can still have Harry facing off against enemies with little help due to circumstances. A good author could make this all work excellently. There's nothing impossible about this idea, just need an author skilled and clever enough to think things through and make it work.

And not everyone is interested in a gore-fest. If you want to kill a bunch of people you could set up the rules of the game differently and tweak the setting too. Make the setting darker, with much more lingering problems. Force Harry into more life-or-death situations.

***** The reason they die is because they trivialize literally everything. Not just the difficulty of beating opponents or antagonists, but the entire concept of the story itself.

The problem is not the numbers, it's that ALL gamer stories have the protagonist be the only person who experiences the game. The very, very few stories I have read where at least one other character than the MC have the gamer abilities, or where the MC doesn't keep this ability secret, are often interesting regardless.

**** Or a Fallout style to system where everything counts. You could even have skill sections for charms, DADA and the like. Have each year based off of a 10 point block and everything over 70 would be mastery level things not taught in Hogwarts. Basically if you meet both a stat and/or skill point number you learn the spell or potion and earn exp.

With a fallout RP system most stats are static for each person but perks and skill point spread is the biggest thing for PC and NPC people. For example Snape might have a higher skill level in potions then voldemort but be behind him in the dark arts skill. Lucius malfoy could be a charisma based person with a high speech skill. Maybe his skillet is not fighting directly (could be the reason he was beat by mostly fifth years in OtoP.

*** Gamer fics are where characters suddenly find themselves with the power to use game mechanics to themselves. They find themselves with Health bars, stamina bars, magic bars able to gain buffs from eating foods or resting etc. They also gain the power to "Lv up" by doing tasks, thus making their rate of growth explosive. i.e, doing a certain task like completing Homework gives you experience points. Passing the experience threshold gives you points to add to your attributes. So your strength, intelligence, charisma grow up magically overnight whereas a Normal person would have to train themselves up and study to do this

Si is short for self insert. It's basically mega wish fulfillment in which you write yourself or a character based on yourself or someone you know into your favourite story/fic and he goes through life in the story, perhaps saving characters, changing plots, discovering new things or growing stronger etc....or suffering through mega loads of shit depending on the fic writer and fandom. (I have no idea why someone would want to be dropped into Warhammer 40k. That universe is just a hellhole on its last legs and where disaster is just another Monday.)

But that's basically it.

Wherein the MC wakes up one day with a game-like interface and has most of the abilities traditionally seen in gamer fanfictions.

Her new book is actually harming the already negative image trans people have by making the killer a guy in woman's clothing. That is everything but being an ally.

And that is why I really don't even want to play the game at all (not even if I managed to get it free) because I am quite scared that it might use stereotypes or allegories that will piss me off.
