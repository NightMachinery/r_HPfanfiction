Gosh it's been a long time since I've posted here!

Anyway, I was wondering if anyone had come across a fic following Dobby during Prisoner of Azkaban. He vanishes from the series the entire year... I'm sure he got up to some ridiculous adventures in that time :')

If you decide this sounds like a great prompt, feel free to use the post name as the title if you like it. I'm hoping there are already fics In The Wild covering this, though.


** I've never seen one, but here's my pitch.

Shortly after the great Harry Potter tricked Lucius Malfoy into providing him his freedom, Dobby set out to explore the world. From the moment he was a little Elfling he had been in servitude to the Malfoy family, most of his life confined to the foreboding halls of Malfoy Manor. But now, now he was free.

He started off by heading south, he had never left the shores of England, and was determined to see more of the world. First he hopped the chanel to France, visiting Paris and moving south to Spain. There he enjoyed the sun as he travelled across the country, before reaching the Strait of Gibraltar, which he quickly crossed, arriving in Morocco.

For several weeks Dobby travelled from one country to another, hopping all over Africa. In Egypt he was overjoyed to see the little Weasley girl happily spending time with her family, free of that terrible item his former Master had planted on her. He often thought of reaching out, they seemed like such a friendly family who could maybe use the help. But still, he wasn't sure if he was ready for new masters just yet.

Soon the Weasleys left back for England, leaving the eldest child behind. He must work here Dobby thought as he watched him exploring the Pyramids, dismantling the various curses as he went. Dobby thought it seemed like such a fantastic job.

He had planned on leaving soon, to head further south along the River Nile and see more of what Africa had to offer. But he found himself stalling, was that going to be his life now, just going from one place to another? It had been great to start with, but he couldn't keep doing it forever. As he sat on top of the Great Pyramid watching the sunset, he thought about the Weasley boy, day after day he did something he found great enjoyment in, and was rewarded for his efforts with pay. Could he do that? Could he find a job of his own? But what did he enjoy?

And that it hit him, his work as a House Elf, the cooking, the cleaning, that was never the problem. It was the family, the Malfoys and the cruelty he received from them, that was always the problem. He loved work, he always had, it was his one solace from the treatment he received.

His mind made up, Dobby set off. He would head back to England, he would find a family, and he would ask for payment. Of course, he took his time, he had a goal and he would reach it eventually, but why not enjoy himself on the way home. He made his way north and back into Europe, visiting country after country over the next few months as he made his way back to England.

By the time he reached there he found troubling news, a man had escaped from Azkaban and was after the great Harry Potter. Should he help? He could, but Harry Potter had explicitly told him not to save his life again, he had been very clear about that. Dobby decided that he should focus on finding work instead.

Over the next few months he visited family after family. It was always the same, they would welcome him in, they would seem happy about the thought of having a House Elf, and then Dobby would say that he wanted to be paid. Some would be nice, they would tell him that's not what they were looking for and allow him to leave on his own. Others, would not be so nice, and Dobby would find himself being told quite rudely to leave.

After months of rejection Dobby was feeling lost, and then as he was walking down Diagon Alley, looking for someone he could approach, he saw a familiar face. It was Winky, he remembered her, the House Elf for Mr Crouch, what was she doing out here by herself? Dobby approached her, to find out she had been set free as well, she was not as overjoyed as he had been.

It was then Dobby had an idea, while no one he had approached so far had liked the idea of paying an Elf, there was one who might. So Dobby told Winky his idea, they would go to Hogwarts, they would talk to Albus Dumbledore, and they would ask him for a job.

** I know what he did. Chundered /everywhere/

I presume he would send updates on his chunderings to Harry throughout the year or, better, Draco?
