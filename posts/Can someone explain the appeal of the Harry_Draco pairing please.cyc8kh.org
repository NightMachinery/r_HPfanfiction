** Harry: rough-and-tumble poor kid, jet-black hair, expansive.

Draco: aristocratic prat, light blonde hair, conceals his emotions from everyone.

Both prime targets for angst; both cute boys; canonically have a childish rivalry of the sort usually developed into a romance by bad novelists.

It's basically All The Gay Pairing Tropes in one /Harry Potter/-themed bundle. You need only look at the shameless invocation of all these tropes by /Good Omens/ to see what I mean. Draco and Harry couldn't have been more suited to slashing if Rowling had been aiming for it.

Again, at this point, the handiest roadmap for non-slash-readers wanting to guess how slashable a pair of characters is is how much they look like Crowley and Aziraphale. It's not by far the only way a gay relationship can work, in fiction or otherwise, but it's definitely what slash is most interested in: "opposites attract" stories where both participants are cute boys.

What is slash-fic /but/ wishful thinking and fandom tropes? We're trying to understand the mindset of slashfic writerers, here, not actually discussing the canonical plausibility of a Draco/Harry relationship.

As for hair color, it's a matter of aesthetic. A blonde and a brunette look good kissing. You should not underestimate those sorts of concerns when dealing with shipping; you would, in much the same way, be at a complete loss for why people ship Hermione so much if you didn't take into account that by most standards Emma Watson is an extremely beautiful woman.

** Maybe consider if Draco had been written as a girl. A platinum blonde girl with grey eyes and delicate features who comes from an aristocratic background. She's so mean-spirited and manipulative and she just CANNOT leave our hero alone. She hates losing out to him for anything. Then one year she stops paying attention to our hero, and our hero starts following her everywhere, desperate to know what's going on with her. She's on the wrong side of the war, but only because she was born into it. Is she really an enemy, or can she be redeemed?

If it isn't clear enough: if Draco had been written as a girl, she would have been called a femme fatale and Drarry would have been the top het ship in the fandom.

** It took me years to actually watch the movie's after they were out, but if you look closely enough (and based on interpretation, really) you'll find Rowling leaving little breadcrumbs that has us questioning Harry's sexuality.

Harry repeatedly pays close attention to the appearance of the men he interacts with. Realistically, I don't care either way... But it's also fun to think of Harry/Draco being a drastic, closeted gay/bi/pan who breaks out of his shell when he sheds the duties and expectations everyone has of him.

To be honest, Harry and Draco are two sides of the same coin. I know a lot of people who think of Draco as a coward or a "wuss", but he has never known strife. His life was never endangered, nor has he had to learn how to fight to survive. Arguably, Malfoy wasn't outright abused unless he displeased his Father (who was an evil son'vabitch imo).

He grew up spoiled, believing the lies his parents told him. Unlike Black, who hated his parents, Draco held respect but learned - and this is speculation here - that the love from his Father wasn't as unconditional as it should have been. When people seek out acceptance, a large majority will do /*whatever*/ it takes...when you want to be accepted by your /own parents/, it's a done deal.

Malfoy is spoiled, an only child and believes in all that Pureblood horseshite because he wants to feel /special/. Because he believes Purebloods *are* special. But he's also loyal to his family in the end doing whatever he can to save his mother. Draco has layers. Even if Rowling never deemed it worthy to explore them, for any writer who isn't creating an OC, he's an angsty mound of clay for us to build, mould and break as we see fit.

Harry is literally the opposite of his pointy faced peer. The way he grew up, was a sure way to make sure he didn't turn out the way Draco did. Being _/"neglected"/ and at the very *least* verbally abused by family who are supposed to care and nourish you, could have easily sent him in the same direction that Moldywort had...Except for the fact that Harry never *wanted* power, or fame. He wanted to blend in and just /be/. (Unlike Draco who often tries to force the spotlight on himself.)

... Point is, I ship Drarry for many different reasons. Yes, they are different, but they also have similarities between them. They're Yin and Yang. One couldn't be without the other. Besides, Draco literally only antagonised Harry because Harry (and occasionally Hermione though I don't really ship those two, I can respect them as a pairing) always gave him as good as he got.

A lot of people like to ignore it, but Harry also had a darkness within him that could have easily been cultivated into something petty and malicious.

Both have interesting dynamics and I enjoy speculating on what wonders/horrors I can put them through when I drop them into a universe where they can be more than just /"Malfoy and Potter"/.

** They are /obsessed/ with each other, in the books. Not in a sexual way, obviously, but Draco is constantly trying to get Harry's attention with various weird stunts, like the trophy room duel and the dragon in the first book, telling harry he'd be pissed if he knew sirius ahd escaped in book 3, pretending to be dementors in the same book, the badges in book 4, or how he comments on being "dogged" in the fifth book, etc. He is always delivering kinda useful information to the main cast under the guise of being an uppity know-it-all, and a lot of his mean tricks require a lot of thought. Like, "Weasley is Our King"?" -- the kid wrote a pretty elaborate song about Ron, making sure he hit on all of Ron's insecurities. Draco sure is mean, but he is also incredibly attentive and dedicated in the pursuit of getting Harry's goat. I think it is pretty easy to read all of this as him being like that ten year old boy in your English class who kicks you because he thinks that's how you flirt.

However, for the first five books, Harry & the gang mostly ignore him, Harry most of all. He says he doesn't want to be friends when they first meet, and pretty much follows through. Other than in CoS where they think he's the heir of Slytherin, Draco mostly just enters into the plot because he's chasing Harry, not because Harry has any interest in him. This of course changes in HBP, when suddenly, Harry is /just as obsessed with Draco/ as Draco has been with him for the start of the series. He stalks him, wonders about him constantly, listens to him cry, etc., even though Ron and Hermione tell him that it's weird and that he should knock it off. They obviously don't have a healthy interest in each other, or if they do have a healthy interest they aren't expressing it in healthy ways, but the two of them are canonically very interested in what the other is doing.

Then, from a thematic level, Draco and Harry makes sense because one of Harry's primary goals throughout the series is to recreate the family that was taken from him in the prologue. This is why the Weasley's are so important and why JK saw her epilogue as a suitable way to wrap things up, when he is explicitly shown to have a wife and family and all is well. Well guess what? The only redeeming feature of the Malfoy family is shown again and again to be their love for each other. In fact, it's Narcissa's love for Draco which saves Harry near the end of DH, when she notices he's still alive and proceeds not to turn him in, thus allowing the whole dramatic conclusion against Voldemort. A Draco/Harry relationship would end up healing Harry's primary loss, giving him a family that both loves him and is alive.

There's also the fact that Draco really just never does anything that deplorable. He's a bully, of course, but he's also pretty pathetic. He goes up against Harry and the gang over and over, and is embarrassed every single time. The worst things he does are failing to kill people and failing to torture people -- things that Harry ultimately does both of, and the latter with some joy. Draco's whiny and spoiled. He's also pretty funny -- his ongoing commentary during Hagrid's class is pretty much what any sane person, /including Harry/, is thinking. Harry is a snarky lad who seems to value humor in his relationships to a pretty large degree, and if he were able to get over his hatred of Draco, I'd put that as a point towards the success of their relationship.

I'm not a huge fan of super-sexy fanon!Draco, and I also don't think it's a necessary change to make to the text to allow for a relationship between them. If you allow Draco and Harry to veer from their canon sexual orientations, there's a pretty strong canonical foundation for a relationship. Certainly a stronger one than there is for Daphne/Luna/Tonks/whatever, and arguably a stronger one than there is for Hermione. In addition to this foundation, you have a built in interesting narrative arc: how are they possibly going to get over the years of mutual dislike?

idk. There are a lot of really bad drarry stories out there, and most of them aren't in this mold. But this is the reason why I think it can be an interesting dynamic to explore. Post-war Drarry that features a gawky, trying to self-reform, theatre-kid!Draco and a kinda aloof, emotionally scarred, prejudiced Harry is just something I like.

Surprising how that never picked up as much as Harry/Draco or Harry/Hermione, maybe because of lack of interaction or chemistry between Draco and Ginny in rest of the books published after 2001.. ? Or maybe because of popularity of HD ship.

Draco Dormiens came out between PoA and GoF actually, though the latter parts of the trilogy took book 4 into account a little bit - mostly to bring in Fleur, who is apparently distantly related to Draco. Oh god...she might be responsible for the Veela!Draco trope too.

But I'm not willing to give her credit for a H/D "win" as such. She was openly friends with Rhysenn at the time - even named a character in the trilogy after her, so H/D wasn't unknown territory at the time. I think hers was just more an early case of queerbaiting. It's not as if she really had any compunctions about what was considered socially acceptable to write about: the first iteration of a "Mortal Instruments" story she wrote was a detailed smut one-shot between an underage Ron and Ginny. Openly writing H/D would have been pretty tame by comparison.

Cassie Claire didn't get flak just because she wrote Draco out of character - loads of fanfics do that, and there's nothing inherently immoral about it - she got into flak because she plagiarised a lot of her work from famous TV shows and such. There are articles about it all over the web.

I've only read the first Mortal Instruments novel and seen the Shadowhunter TV show (which by the way I'd actually recommend for the Malec pairing), but from that alone it's pretty clear that Cassie has a kink for incest.

*** I do not subscribe to simplified viewpoint that Tom Felton is hot, hence HPDM fics are popular. If that's the argument, I do not find Daniel Radcliffe hot, but still I read Harryxany fics with UST.

I think it goes back to how Fanon!Draco is written consistently, with sort of bad boy, anti-hero personality.

** Basically a lot of people mainly young girls and teens want to read a spicy romance between two main characters in a story. If its a pairing between frenemies, enemies, or rivals then the want is heightened as its seen as a forbidden romance or something like that along the lines. Ever heard of yaoi? Look it up because it'll explain a lot. Lastly some people just love to pair up rivals in a story like Batman and Superman, Naruto and Sasuke, Bakugou and Midoriya aka Deku, Spiderman and Venom, Captain America and Iron Man, Magneto and Professor X, Loki and Thor. These are all legit pairings that people have made and are all fairly popular. Many of these might sound weird AF but people just eat it up on Archive of Our Own (a huge fandom website).

*** Batman and Superman are best friends in the GOOD DC properties. I don't mind slash with them but I prefer Batman to be with Wonder Woman

** A lot of people get Draco confused with Spike from Buffy who is kinda cool and dominant with a wussy side, as opposed to Draco who is more of a sad whiny wuss.

That said, the one Drarry I liked used his canon awfulness to lure me into reading about his being broken down horribly and then built back up into someone I liked in a way that wouldn't have worked if it had happened to a character I liked. I can't find it rn but it involved a necromantic torture maze in the department of mysteries.
