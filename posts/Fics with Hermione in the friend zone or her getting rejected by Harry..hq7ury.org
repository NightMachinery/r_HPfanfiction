I know it is very specific, but I am so bored and i am suddenly craving for it. I also think that Harry and Hermione pairing would never work and I have read some H/HR stories but they always spew the same noncense how Harry is selfless and he has saved Hermione's life before etc. I can go on and on but i just request you to give some stories like these if you know them. They can be one shots, short stories or long stories with a million words. I don't care.

As an HHr shipper I was upset to have it turn out that way while marked Harry/Hermione but hopefully my loss can be your gain.

  Blood magic was supposed to keep Harry safe, but his relatives are expendable. Blood magic was supposed to keep Harry looking like his adoptive father, but it's wearing off. Blood is a bond, but so is the memory of hate -- or love.

  For years she had plotted her revenge, conspiring against everyone who tried to keep her from the crown. Finally, everything now seems to go ahead according to plan, but all she truly wants is Igraine on her knees. Then, suddenly, Morgan realizes that hers isn't hatred at all. [FemSlash: Morgan x Igraine]

  She was never really his. Dean's perspective of his romance (and break up) with Ginny Weasley. Canon compliant. From the start of his sixth year to just before Malfoy let the Death Eaters enter Hogwarts.
