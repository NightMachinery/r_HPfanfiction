Hypothetically, You accidentally summon a demon while smashed, And in a panic seal it inside your cat, tapping it in a Devil's trap in your bathtub, what do you do after that?


** "Who was the floo from; Harry?" Hermione asked from where she was entertaining Teddy as he returned from the floo room.

"Ron. He said that he was in trouble and needed my help with something. He wasn't very clear though. Something about being drunk and summoning something he was not supposed to and the bathroom. He just asked me to hurry up and get my ehm to get to you two's apartment immediately. Would you mind keeping an eye on Teddy while I go check on him?" he asked her. She narrowed her eyes and after a brief pause replied. "Why don't I go check on him while you entertain Teddy. He seems to be getting bored of me and missing you."

He held back a snort. He knew all too well that Hermione was looking for an excuse to leave before she had to watch Teddy eat or worse try to feed him as Teddy always makes her do when she came to visit. She hated how messy it was. He was sure that Teddy had only a few years left before Hermione starts getting on his case about proper table manners. He was surprised she did not try to get his toddler godson to behave for all the good it would do her as it is.

"Sure." he answered and watched Hermione wave goodbye to Teddy before quickly turning her head to avoid looking at Teddy's now Brown eyes looking imploringly at her. She never could resist the doe eyes if she got caught in them. As Hermione left he briefly wondered why Ron asked him for help when he knew Hermione would be here helping him take care of Teddy when Mrs Tonks was out for the weekends but quickly put it out of his mind as he leaned down to pick Teddy up. Teddy had changed his eyes to match his own green eyes and he felt his affection for his godson grow stronger. He hopes Remus and Tonks approve of how he is raising Teddy. He had been hesitant about moving in with Mrs Tonks to help her raise Teddy but he feels he made the right decision.

** I mean, I'm pretty sure that's the prologue of this ([[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHccClTAdzc]]) music video, but I'll give the prose a go. Needs a lot of editing (I did none, this was one draft and I just wrote 'til I ran out of write), but it was a fun start - I might turn it into a proper story someday. :D

Why do these people insist on sending owls with parchment (real parchment! the mind boggles, really) at such mad hours? Don't the buggers sleep? Or use email? He tossed another book, this one about an inch thick and a deep red leather that made him think of dried blood. He looked back at the shelves and made to pull out another book. He stopped. A flash of brown curls and accusing eyes popped into his head.

He sighed, then turned to pick up the book. He gave it a little dustoff then placed it at the top of one of the piles of various other tomes, treatises, volumes, and publications that now filled every damn square inch of his daughter's bedroom.

He turned back to the shelves again and paused once more. He gulped. Gave the book another pat down, just to be sure. It was a lucky thing she was off at school. Very, very lucky.

It's not like it was his fault he couldn't find the damn book. It was the wizards! Why don't any of the wankers ever label things properly? They emboss their bloody doors in gold filigree ink, but they can't put the names of their bloody books on their bloody spines and- He sighed. Shit. He'd have to ask.

He walked back, nearly knocking over several stacks, but managing not to - yes! He knew he'd still got it - and opened the door, calling out "Darling?"

His beloved wife appeared from... somewhere, probably the other library on the second floor, and stopped at the foot of the stairs up there, resting her hand gently on the wooden panelling that ran across the entire hallway. Her pleasant expression took on a decidedly confused bent. "Yes, Richard?"

The family cat, dear Mrs Godswine herself, prowled through, gave him a cursory glance and sniff, then continued on its divinely-mandated way.

Richard, Emma is looking at you like you're an idiot again. Actually say something, won't you? He coughed, and- "Hermione put the owl books on the blue shelf, right?"

"No, dear." Her expression perfectly conveyed what a stupid question that was. Right, of course. How silly of him. "The blue shelf are the Transfiguration books she got from her professor. The owl books are on the cornflower shelf."

He blinked. "Isn't cornflower just... blue?"

"No, dear." That expression again. Question, stupid. Richard, idiot. Right.

He just nodded before she could continue. "Right. I'll check the cornflower shelf, I suppose." He ducked back into Hermione's bedroom and surveyed all the light touched. Which wasn't much - the books blocked most of it. Huh. Why aren't transparent books a thing?

He shook his head. Focus, Richard. Some idiot sent an owl halfway through your evening snifter and now you've got to work out how to get the blasted thing to hand over the bloody letter, which is what they're supposed to do in the first place, you don't know why it isn't.

Another deep breath. He stepped forward, ignoring the meowing and scratches at the door. There's no way he was going to help Godswine with the bloody mouse again. Infernal creature could get it herself and stop bothering him. Was it too much to ask that he be left alone to finish his brandy and his book?

He made his stumbly, bumbling way to the bookshelves again and started. Had that cornflower bookshelf always been there? He could've sworn it wasn't... Brandy and Book, Richard, Brandy and Book. He hurried over and scoured the shelves for something on owls. And he found it. It was a small book, thank God, about 3 inches across and five inches down, and maybe half a centimetre thick at most. The binding was old, and a pleasantly oil-slick-like rainbow colour.

He pulled it open and scanned the contents page - "Letters, letters, letters... oh! Receiving messages from Them! That's got to be it, right?" He flicked to the page and, noticing the letters were beginning to blur, ever so slightly, he placed his finger on the page. The book steadied and the letters refocused, thankfully, and he began to read the instructions.

And he uttered words that hadn't been uttered on this Earth for a very, very long time.

"𝖕𝖍'𝖓𝖌𝖑𝖚𝖎 𝖒𝖌𝖑𝖜'𝖓𝖆𝖋𝖍 𝖜𝖌𝖆𝖍'𝖓𝖆𝖌𝖑 𝖋𝖍𝖙𝖆𝖌𝖓

A thunderous ripple spreads as he speaks, and the walls themselves seem to shake with every word. An ethereal wind swept his hair back. Innumerable stars glowed in his vision, glittering like diamonds as he gazed into the endless scope of black and dust that was the cosmos.

The shadows danced and the light wailed, the books - egad, the books! He darted over just in time to snatch a tome out of the air, as it tried to join its fellows in the vast swirling whirlpool of words and paper that had grown, guzzled most of the wall that had once been bookshelves. It pulled everything in, time and matter and mind and the bloody books, oh Hermione was going to kill him!

Something squirming and squamous and wriggling writhed within the whirlpool and grew into an emerald orb, an infinite eye of knowledge that saw nothing but knew all as it pushed through the tattered walls of reality that bent and warped around the walls of the bedroom. The green threatened to devour him, watching everything he was, everything he is, and everything he could ever be in the span of a moment.

As it loomed, the form extended from the whirlpool and the eye became evidently only the hint of something more, something far, far bigger than the world the man it was looking at lived upon. His mind boggled at the possibility of something bigger than a fucking planet looking him over.

And the eye reached in, little hands extended out from the vitreous and grabbed for him, languid gropes with long, bony fingers that moved like spider legs. He just stood and watched, unable to even think of doing anything, as it loomed closer and closer until-

A yowl, a screech, and a ball of orange fur and sharp claws launched itself into the eye. It landed, claws tearing and scratching at the sclera and the hands and the green pupil of the eye started to deflate like an aardvark and crumpled like a nebula and the cat - blessed Mrs Godswine! - clawed harder until the thing squirmed and retreated back into the whirlpool.

The moment it vanished, the whirlpool just... dropped. And the tide of words washed past him, swirling around him as it swept everything but him up in its wake. He could hear the cat, still shrieking, but that was all aside from the rampaging thunder of the words coursing through his daughter's bedroom.

Then suddenly, it all just... stopped, and Richard Granger looked around the now limpid husk of his daughter's room, empty of any and all books except the one that'd started this, then said, in a terrible tone. "Well, shit."

After a beat, the cat looked up too, with yellow-green eyes that were disturbingly human and said, in the same terrible tone. "Well, shit."

...Harry Potter crossover Garfield Origin Story anyone? :D

I like to imagine the entity he summoned kind of went native after this. Still alien, but it got a little used to being spoiled by the Grangers (and yes, Hermione left an Eldritch Summoning Tome in her room - that's such a Hermione thing to do). A little bit cat, a little bit Cthulhu to create the dread entity we know only as... Cathulu!
