Hi! So recently I've been diving deeper into the world of slash and I noticed a pretty big gap between M/M and F/F and it's almost downright impossible to find a good femslash fic which is such a shame. I was wondering if anyone on here knew of any good ones they'd be willing to share? Any pairing is fine as long as its f/f. Please and Thank you!


** All of my completed stories are FemHarry. Some are crossovers, but the primary series (Yule Ball Panic, The Power of Love, and Heart and Soul) takes place entirely within the Harry Potter universe.

Harrie's experience with dragons has been much worse than hers, but Harrie's a different kind of Gryffindor. The utterly ridiculous, daredevil kind. "Go back to sleep, Harrie.""But the dragon."

  “The first group I sent over made the Avengers uncomfortable by thanking them constantly and asking for autographs. The next group stole things to sell on ebay. The group after that didn't even get through the front door because Stark's security system found something in their background that we missed. The fourth group left traumatized after cleaning out Thor's room, apparently the god had some beheaded poultry dripping blood into a bowl in there. Then after that every group I've left hasn't lasted more than three days because of some problem or another. I'm pretty sure one of those assholes has made it a game to scare my workers away.”“I don't think you're supposed to call the heroes of New York assholes.”Or, cleaning up after the Avengers involves more than just getting blood stains out of the carpet and most of them can't take the heat. Thankfully the Savior of the Wizarding has spent the last decade cleaning up after Death Eaters, so she's up to the task. Nothing, not pranks, bird corpses, or unidentified slime will keep her from cleaning up. This Fic is now complete!

  At this very moment, Hermione Granger is a tiny muggleborn child who's tried half a dozen spells. No one is scared of her. No one knows to expect her."We're really doing this," Pansy eventually says, breaking the silence. "We must be insane.""We're saving the country." Hermione tears her gaze from the sunrise across the treetops of the Forbidden Forest to find that Pansy is already looking her way, something resolute in her gaze. It's too solemn of an expression for a child, but Hermione's probably isn't better.

  “I don't have to justify my place here to you.” Millicent's voice is like ice, and Hermione can't help herself from flinching, pulling back in her seat to put more distance between them. She's faced down dark wizards, but this feels different. Hermione feels her cheeks warm and thinks about trying to apologise, to take back her words or say something to take away the sting of them, but before she can say anything Millicent snaps, “Why are you here?” After the war Hermione tries to make up for her wartime by working in the Department of Magical Accidents. She's not expecting to end up working at a desk opposite one Millicent Bulstrode, but she'll put up with whatever she has to, if it gives her a chance at getting her parents' memories back.

** I don't like Slash much but I would suggest Iris Potter and the Goblet's Surprise, Harriet Eilhart: The Sorceress, Her Mother's Love, A Witch and an Amazon Walk into a Bar, The Chosen One has Knockers. The last one is half smut.

A Butterfly Effect, Lily Potter and the Witches of Salem, Crazy Little Things, and Bound with Silver Threads. I've been recommended the fanfics from A Butterfly Effect to Bound with Silver Threads. The first part is just copy and pasted from a reddit post.

** It is a shame, but I actually dislike just genderswapped characters with no explanations or apparent differences in the story. I'd love to see more trans girl fics myself.
