are there Fics that have a Born Female Harry whos story follows (mostly) Canon, especially the 4th Year and Harry is...like the "others" under the Veelas charm? So Harry is heavily attracted by her and Fleur finds Fem!Harry cute. Their Relationship would blossom in the passing time.

I can imagine, that in "Book 6" when Fleur is delivering Harry with the Breakfast and kisses him/her cheeks, she performs a deep and passionate one on the Lips, that leaves Harry dreamily. Although i would like this to happen, i doubt that something as this exist. Rons reaction would be priceless, i guess.


** Linkffn(mistakes and Second chances) is a Peggy sue fic where Harry goes back in time and finds that dumbledore made her male, she dismisses the enchantment and hooks up with fleur in 4th year

  I took a flying leap through the Veil of Death. Gonna' be honest, not the smartest thing I've ever done. OOC, fem!Harry, dark!Harry. Elemental and Black Magics. Femslash. Rated M for language, violence, and mature topics.
