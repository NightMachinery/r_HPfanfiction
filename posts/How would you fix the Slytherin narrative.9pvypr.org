So while many people feel like there is an anti-Slytherin bias, there is an argument to be made that it is not unjustified since pretty much the only decent person to canonically come from there is Andromeda Tonks, who ditched her "Slytherin family" and ran away with Edward. With the exception of Pettigrew, all Death Eaters we know the house of came from Slytherin.

So, how would one fix that disparity without whitewashing the issue the issues Slytherin had? Namely a significant population who sympathised with or outright joined the Death Eaters and a biased head of house who used to be a terrorist and abuses his power to bully children.

Token gestures ("Not ALL Slytherins, I have a Slytherin friend who was decent...") seem like a very cheap way to do this, there has to be more.

Not /just quite/. Quirrell was a Ravenclaw. (I mean, he wasn't /formally/ a Death Eater but having Voldemort literally attached to your head is as good as a Dark Mark, I think.)

** I don't think there's an easy fix, everything that I would consider a decent fix would be completely AU:

- put more DEs into other houses. Draco doesn't fit in Slytherin, put him in Gryffindor, but he remains just as evil. Maybe Snape was a Ravenclaw?

- The DEs recruit for their bigoted cult equally from all houses... maybe Slytherin is still slightly dominant, but not to an extreme

- DEs basically inspired by real terrorist organizations, where you truly don't know who the enemies are (JKR tried to do this, but failed hard, everyone is being an idiot for not catching on; sidenote: IMHO it wouldn't be an overreaction to disband Slytherin House in canon, since it's such a breeding ground)

- have named characters that are good (and/or neutral) in Slytherin who exemplify the positive qualities of their house in a non-evil way: clever, ambitious, cunning, foresight, sneaky

- get rid of all the "this is House-Evil"-symbolism. They don't live in the dungeons and everyone doesn't behave like gorillas. Most Slytherins are charming and nice, because they want to get ahead. Making enemies and openly being evil is stupid

- have racist/pure-blooded bigots from Slytherin who do not want to see the world burn and therefore still oppose Voldemort (any self respecting Slytherin won't bow down to him and getting tortured all day is not a great ambition)

- show examples of how the other House qualities can also be used to corrupt (Gryffindor and Ravenclaw are easy, Hufflepuff more difficult). On that note: Why does Pettigrew have to be a coward? "Oh, he wasn't a true Gryffindor, that's the only reason he was bad" -> way too easy. JKR clearly wanted Gryffindor to be the good house, because she can't commit.

The thing is, fair-play and chivalry kinda prohibit the motion of hunting down defenceless people and kill them for fun. And intelligence and wit rule out the belief in pureblood supremacy. There might be the odd few Hufflepuffs who believe that they are doing the right thing or Ravenclaws who think that Voldemort will help them discover hidden knowledge, but the way the sorting is done it will always be rigged towards Slytherin.

She modeled them after the Third Reich during the war (or very close to the war). The Nazis were much more subtle and didn't gain public acclaim by immediately calling for the genocide of the jews and total war. I think I don't have to explain to you about the Hitlerjugend, Bund Deutscher Mädchen, improving conditions for workers, etc. There's good reasons why there was so little resistance to the Nazis and why the populace was generally enthusiastic about Hitler. The analogy IMHO falls very flat in that regard.

That's true, but I think "Machiavellian" is a bit too grand. I've seen a few young people who were very ambitious, knew what they want and had a plan on how to get there. I don't think it's too hard to portray that as long as you let them still be kids to a degree - just more self-aware.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

I'd focus more on prideful, brash, self-righteous and short-tempered here. Even "fair-play" could be corrupted into trying to help the underdog (pure bloods) who don't get what they deserve. It seems pretty easy to transfer modern alt-right talking points ("prevent white genocide") towards Gryffs.

** Well the first step would be breaking the 'One Slytherin' ideal of the house where Slytherin is a monolith and doing so with a ousting of Malfoy and or Snape, Malfoy is by far the most vocal Slytherin character in probably one of the most plugged in and promising years in Hogwarts with Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, Susan Bones, a Weasley kid (his family has fingers in Dragons and Dragon Goods, Curse breaking, the Ministry and twin brothers who seemingly run Hogwarts black market) and that's just known plugs and those with major promise. By removing Malfoy as the Figure head of the students or removing Snape and his protection. We see a few times Snape manipulate Malfoy's aggressive bullying nature into detentions for Harry (which to me speaks more that Snape himself was a bit of a bully even in Hogwarts rather than just the victim Fanon portrays him).

** Well, first let's nix the idea that the Sorting actually means anything in the long run. It should be a way to sort the children equally into four houses for logistics purposes, nothing more. The houses are based on the four founders who themselves may have stood for certain ideals, but the actual houses are not the be-all end-all of your personality. The Sorting Hat might put you in Gryffindor to bolster your confidence a bit, or in Hufflepuff to socialize more, but beyond that it means nothing. It's not a personality test. You can be brave and righteous and still be a dick. You can be loyal and hardworking and still make nasty comments about people behind their back. You can be cunning and ambitious and still be a nice person. You can read all the books in the world and still be ignorant and self centered. Your house does not determine what kind of person you are.

Second let's dismiss the notion that you can't be non-Slytherin and racist against muggleborns at the same time. This is purely a cultural issue, not an indicator of your personality. You can be an overall pleasant person and still think muggleborn are the scum of the earth if that's what you've been taught growing up. Slytherin will have a greater concentration because that's where a lot of purebloods flock to, but they are by no means alone in their views.

Third, and back to the personality thing, /being in Slytherin House does not mean you're a bad person/. Ambition and cunning are not inherently bad traits. Want to be the best at literally anything? You have to be ambitious if you want to get anywhere. Have a natural inclination to wheedling favors out of your parents and friends? Well, that's quite cunning of you! Neither of those things mean you're going to drop everything and go lynch a muggleborn in their own home. Purebloods flock to Slytherin house for a lot of things: Legacy, tradition, expectations to succeed, and so on. If you've been groomed to inherit the family business, something many purebloods no doubt have, you're a shoe-in for Slytherin because succeeding at such requires both ambition and cunning in large amounts. But while there is a concentration of purebloods in Slytherin, I doubt it's even half the people in there. The rest are people who are simply naturally cunning and/or have a drive to succeed, and you don't get far in life if you're mean and nasty to other people. Pureblood Slytherin children are just the vocal minority, so they get the most attention.

I also like to imagine that Slytherin has a friendly rivalry with Ravenclaw due to both houses' need for good grades.

Now, I freely admit that I have no real idea of how to frame this in a realistic way. Accurate socioeconomic and political world building is beyond me right now, which I think is actually the problem: Rowling's portrayal of Slytherin house is not representative of reality. There's no room in it, narratively speaking, for people who aren't evil. I think to actually have a chance at fixing it, you need to disassociate Slytherin house from Voldemort and the Pureblood ideology. It's a societal issue, not a House issue.

And if what I said doesn't make sense, there is a very real chance you are correct and I'm just spewing jargon.

  Andromeda Tonks, who ditched her "Slytherin family" and ran away with Edward
#+end_quote

This is kind of the first thing that suggests that they're not as evil as canon portrays them to be - If Slytherins (and Blacks) are so evil and mad about blood purity, why was Andromeda allowed to live so long? Going on by how Sirius describes them, they seem like the kind of characters who would find honour killing acceptable - but they don't do it, even when it could have been done and the blame placed at Voldemort's feet.

And during the second war, Bellatrix and Narcissa, being the evil Slytherins that they are, didn't attack Andromeda and Ted - they just let them be. Ted was killed by Snatchers, not by either Bellatrix or Narcissa.

Nymphadora also had a child with a werewolf, of all things, and neither she, nor her mother or child or husband were killed for that - in spite of Voldemort himself talking about culling the unwanted branches from the pure trees (or something similar).

#+begin_quote
  With the exception of Pettigrew, all Death Eaters we know the house of came from Slytherin
#+end_quote

One of the things that is said about the first war was that no one knew who to trust - this is a suggestion that literally anyone could be a Death Eater, and the mistrust probably came from people who were revealed as Death Eaters themselves. People who no one would have guessed becoming Death Eaters could have been what fueled such a deep seated feeling of mistrust in the populace. That is more than enough to say that there were Death Eaters from all four houses.

Later on once he has Fudge's ear, he wouldn't care about Sirius (probably forgot about his existence after 10+ years) considering how he was sentenced for life and nobody would ever hear from "Voldemort's right hand man" again. Nobody had ever escaped from Azkaban before Sirius, so Lucius had no reason to think he would ever be a problem again.

Also, with basic sanitation and physical activity, you're assuming a lot about what wizards need in order to survive. Humans, we definitely would need that, but in Harry Potter the wizards tend to be much more resistant than muggles. Just look at how Mad-Eye spent almost an entire school year stuck in a trunk. I'm pretty sure he didn't receive physical recreation or any showers, and he still managed to survive. In all fairness his stint being locked up is much shorter than Sirius', but it gives some sort of indication of a magical person's resistance.

I'm going to go out on a limb and say that the Imperius defence is actually a more solid defence than fanon authors would like to think. In HP's class of 40, only 1 student (HP himself) can stand up to the curse when performed by a legit Death Eater. 1 in 40. When you look at it that way, Lucius' Imperius defense is quite solid, and he might not have told her the truth about it.

After the resurrection, she didn't bother because there was a Dark Lord in the house. Between her life, the lives of her son and husband, and the lives of random strangers, I'm not surprised she chose the former.

  After the events of the second wizarding war, Lucius found his son as affectionate as ever, but *refusing to follow the same old pure-blood line.*

  *Draco married the younger sister of a fellow Slytherin. Astoria Greengrass, who had gone through a similar (though less violent and frightening) conversion from pure-blood ideals to a more tolerant life view, was felt by Narcissa and Lucius to be something of a disappointment as a daughter-in-law. They had had high hopes of a girl whose family featured on the ‘Sacred Twenty-Eight', but as Astoria refused to raise their grandson Scorpius in the belief that Muggles were scum, family gatherings were often fraught with tension.*

*** I think the problem is that a lot of people had their perception of Slytherin House and Death Eaters skewed by Hagrid in Book 1 (in much the same way as Harry had his view skewed) when he said that 'there's not a witch or wizard who went bad who wasn't in Slytherin.' which is...a very Hagrid thing to say, but not entirely accurate, since we've got Sirius Black (according to what Hagrid knew when he said it) who was Voldemorts most loyal blah blah blah and a Griffindor, and in reality Peter Pettigrew.

So we already knew that Hagrid was exaggerating on at least one count - he personally knew of at least one Gryffindor who joined the Death Eaters, while we also know of one - but that doesn't mean that there weren't others.

#+begin_quote
  Pretty much the only decent person to canonically come from there is Andromeda Tonks...
#+end_quote

Horace Slughorn, Merlin, Alphard Black, even (to some degree) Severus Snape--all were largely praiseworthy in canon. It's not clear from canon that there wasn't representation of Death Eaters from other Hogwarts houses. We only know a handful of Death Eaters' Hogwarts houses definitively and we do know there were non-Hogwarts Death Eaters (Karkaroff) and sympathizers (Greyback). Hagrid's comments in Book 1 were from a biased, unreliable source: recall at the time that he believed Sirius Black, a Gryffindor, to be Voldemort's right-hand man.

Setting that aside, supposing that indeed nearly all Death Eaters came from Slytherin, a way to handle this would be to draw parallels between the First Wizarding War and the American Civil War. Most who fought for the Confederacy were not themselves slave owners and benefited little from the practice of slavery. In fact, were slavery abolished, the demand for poor, white labor would have increased markedly and improved their lots in life. But they were enticed into fighting for their collective identity, honor, and culture, which they felt were being compromised by the North at the time. They also fought for their brothers and for charismatic leaders. And they fought because they thought they were fighting on the right side. In terms of the values and norms of the day, there really wasn't an obvious "good" side to the conflict, at least at first. Lincoln famously stated in his first inaugural address that he had "...no purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere with the institution of slavery in the States where it exists. I believe I have no lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do so." This was hardly the stern denouncement of a practice we look back upon today as morally despicable and establishing a moral delineation of sides in the conflict.

Similarly, the House of Slytherin could be rehabilitated in fanfiction by portraying the first war in morally ambiguous terms, at least at the outset. Perhaps the depravity of Tom Riddle and his movement only became evident late in the war and was embellished in the telling, history being defined by the winners. Recall from canon that there was plenty of blood on both sides' hands. Dumbledore, despite holding high political offices and, presumably, having a means of effecting an official resistance, instead led an extralegal guerilla force. Moody was a terror. The Aurors in the first war had license to use the Unforgivables. Barty Crouch abused his office and imprisoned people in Azkaban without trial or testimony.

Also not.clear about Slughorn. All indications seem to be that he did think it was an academic discussion. I don't think he realized Voldemort actually did it until either when his body was destroyed (Crouch Sr. makes it clear to his son at the trial that the Ministry knew Voldemort survived his body's destruction) or when his return became public.

You know, I hate Snape, but your idea that he fucked up an entire generation by starving them of potions knowledge is a complete fanon idea. There's no evidence from canon to support any of that. Canon is how HP perceives things - if he perceives Snape to be a bad teacher, then that is how it will be shown. If you want to talk about him only accepting students with an O into higher classes, well, a lot of professors in university do the same as well - it is their right to set their standards.

#+end_quote

I'm going to say that Slughorn had no idea if Voldemort was still alive or not after 1981 - no one did. HP's shenanigans at school weren't really a thing that was advertised to the general public - which was why the Ministry had to send Hagrid away in the first place in 2nd year - so Slughorn didn't know Voldemort was around in the first place.

And secondly, even if he did tell AD about the Horcruxes, what would they do? Where would they begin to search? AD only confirmed that LV made horcruxes upon seeing the diary, and even then, it took him 3-4 years before he found the next one. Without the diary, he wouldn't have made any progress at all.

Thirdly, and this is something I wrote as a comment before, imagine Slughorn telling AD about the horcruxes and AD finding the ring immediately after 4th year. He gets cursed and is killed at the end of fifth year. The Ministry falls into disarray during 1996. LV also identifies the reason for Dumbledore's blackened hand, and kills Slughorn to clean up a loose end. LV then reigns supreme. Would you say that all of that is Slughorn's fault, because he didn't tell anyone at the "right moment"? Because your statement that LV surviving or learning how to make Horcruxes is somehow Slughorn's fault.

Get real. If TMR didn't find out about them from Slughorn, he would have found out from somewhere else.

Your last line about the discussion not being academic is also untrue. TMR was always described as a charismatic and charming boy by all accounts. No one, and I mean no one, would think that the bright, intelligent and talented 15-16 year old prodigy is going to become a megalomaniac.

No, I meant the part where Voldemort recognises the dis-figuration on Dumbledore's hand as a result of the curse on his ring and takes steps to ensure that his horcruxes are better protected. Because, you know it, AD is getting cursed by the ring no matter what - the temptation of the Stone is too much for him, given his history. After Voldemort figures this out, he would likely torture Slughorn and interrogate him about the people he's told it to. He'll then hunt them down and kill them. Then, he'd just move his horcruxes to another location. And maybe, since the Ring and possibly the Locket are destroyed, he'll do the smart thing and chuck one of his horcruxes into the bottom of the ocean.

And Dumbledore was never going to get the Diadem (because it was hidden inside a room packed with stuff, not to mention the fact that it was a pretty ballsy move hiding a piece of his soul right under Dumbledore's nose) or the Diary or the Cup, because ironically enough, Dumbledore would never think that Voldemort would entrust his followers with pieces of his soul, even if they are ignorant of what he's giving them.

Not as odd as you would think to be honest. '81 Dumbledore just came out of a war. If he finds the resurrection stone, there is a significant chance he would want to use it for more than just seeing his sister.

  You know, I hate Snape, but your idea that he fucked up an entire generation by starving them of potions knowledge is a complete fanon idea. There's no evidence from canon to support any of that. Canon is how HP perceives things - if he perceives Snape to be a bad teacher, then that is how it will be shown.
#+end_quote

He was a bad teacher. Pointing at instructions and saying "Do it or you're an idiot" is shitty teaching. Bullying Harry and worse, Neville, is something you cannot dispute as just being Harry's viewpoint. It was bad enough Hermione had to do Snape's job for him and assist Neville.

Calling it a fanon idea is ludicrous.

Also, I've had bad teachers, and compared to them Snape is pretty mediocre. I've had bad teachers several times. Including in my Masters degree. You wanna know what I did when I had bad teachers? I sucked it up, studied the subjects by myself and passed with good marks.

You're also assuming that only the top 10 percent of all students get the O grade, instead of all students who score above a cut-off, like 90 percent score in the exam.

Besides, the students who want to become aurors and healers know what the limits are - they need to work for it. You have these things in the real world as well, like your chances of getting into the university with a full scholarship would be much higher if your grades were A+ compared to a B.

Also, it is the Ministry that conducts the standardised exams, not the school. Studemts can just as easily take the exams by studying by themselves and applying to the Healers and Aurors with a passing grade in the NEWTs.

**** Well, you did ask how /I/ would fix the Slytherin narrative. Given the prompt, I took the time frame for the rehabilitation to be "At the start of the series." Given the sub, I took the prompt to mean, "How would I do it plausibly, while staying largely faithful to canon?"

I offered two ways: The first, the cop-out many writers use, is to basically pepper Death Eaters among all the Hogwarts houses. Boring, but not implausible.

The second (to me) is the more interesting choice: remove the moral impetus from the first war and make it a Hatfield vs. McCoy thing instead of good vs. evil, at least at its outset. This would have the benefit of allowing more interesting conflict among characters. It would also present Slytherin as less a cesspool of evil than simply a bunch of people who hold different values, proclivities, and cultural norms.

I treated it as a thought experiment, though I sense from the tone of your response that I've somehow missed the mark. For that I apologize.

​

Slytherin might have been created as the antagonists, but this is a childrens book. When we look at it from an adult perspective, it doesn't work that way. Slytherins value ambition, cunning, leadership, and resourcefulness. Blood purity wasn't a criteria. Half bloods and the occasional muggleborns do get sorted there. If the Sorting Hat never actually bothered with peoples choices while sorting, I'm sure many sortings would go differently.

​

Say Slytherin house was abolished, would that actually solve the problem? The concept of blood purity would still exist. Abolishing a house to solve the Death Eater menace is like cutting off a leg after a snakebite rather than administering antivenin.

That's one of those Hogwarts dorms, yeah? Who gives a shit where schoolchildren slept at night?" and then another adult laughs, "Yeah I was a Hoggy kid, too, sorted into Ravenclaw. Can't say as I kept in touch with any of those egg-heads I dormed with, and the most effective hit-wizards I work with now are guys educated abroad."

or some such.

** Hm, my favorite way would actual to get rid of Slytherin and put the students in other houses. Every noteworthy Slytherin has some other strong house trait.

Voldemort, Snape -> thirst for knowledge -> Ravenclaw

Slughorn, Draco, Crabbe and Goyle -> get their validation out of their social standing and group connection -> Hufflepuff

Bellatrix, Crouch Jr. -> are reckless and ready to take huge risks to fulfill Voldemort's plans -> Gryffindor

It would not create that one bad house and it would give all the other houses a more balanced way of dealing with their traits and would create a dark side to their traits.

But if we want to keep Slytherin there are two ways. Either pull the other houses down closer to Slytherin, be giving more death eater characters to those houses and please some that are terrible in their house way (not Pettigrew that became a death eater because he was the opposite of Gryffindor by being a coward).

You know a Gryffindor battlefield commander that lives for the thrill of fighting. A Ravenclaw that gives up all morals in their search for knowledge. A Hufflepuff that is just so loyal to their friends that they don't care about anybody else and refuse to see the wrongs of their own side.

Or you could uplift Slytherin. Show how the house itself struggles with that kind of ideology and Voldemort's war. Show Slytherin as a split house that fights in itself. Show characters that for different reasons didn't follow that kind of thinking or even fight against it.

A hlaf-blood that sees the warning signs and comes to the conclusion that a regime like that would always need a scapegoat to work and they don't want to be around when all muggleborns are gone and people start to look at half-bloods.

A pureblood that is now at the very top of things and that doesn't want to risk it in a war, where they have everything to lose and little to gain.

Someone so convinced of themselves that refuse to say that their ancestors are what defines their worth, but their own abilities.

A shop owner that fights, because war is always bad for business.

But that does not make Slytherin less shit. I like the idea, and it makes for a good narrative, but that does little to improve the overall image of Slytherin.

That one is the best suggestion so far.

**** Like I said, you can lift Slytherin up to be closer to the rest or bring the rest down, to be closer to Slytherin.

But like I said I would prefer a dismantled Slytherin. You can still have Slytherin around as the 'lost house' and the heir of Slytherin, that has to be in another house (making it more logical for people to suspect Harry) and you could really make Slytherin the evil house, because if it gets disband because of it racist believes then people that choose to call themselves Slytherins would choose to, because they identify with those beliefs, like neo-nazis

** About the Snape thing. That's ALL on Dumbledore. He hired Snape as a teacher. He could have given Snape any post. He made him a teacher. He overlooked all of Snape's actions. You mean to say that not one student tried to complain about Snape in his career? Snape as an ex-terrorrist didn't have any pull whatsoever.

Personally, I think it was deliberate. By making the 3 houses hate Slytherin, Voldemort can't recruit from them as easily.

*** While Dumbledore was to blame for tolerating Snape, his deeds are still his own. Also, I don't think that the average student ever met one on one with the headmaster.

**** Students complain to their parents. Or to other students, who then form a group and then complain to another teacher/their Head of House/Headmaster. I doubt even Dumbledore can ignore 40 students standing outside the gargoyle. Parents can come to discuss the issue, send howlers or regular mail, send complaints to the media?

​

Harry doesn't like asking for help and tries to deal with Snape's bullying himself, but all the others don't suffer from that. You can argue that muggleborns can't complain to their parents (assuming they don't get a say, since we never see them involved in school affairs), but the others sure can and will.

​

If this didn't happen, it wasn't as bad as we make it out to be(i.e Harry's presence made Snape worse than he usually is) or Dumbledore has complete dictatorship of the school or some influential people other than Dumbledore or controlled by Dumbledore(Hogwarts does have a Board of Governors) really wanted Snape in the school.

** If you want to fix house Slytherin, you need to show its members slapping down Draco - hard. Whenever Draco says something bigoted or does something supporting Blood purity, he needs to be publically stomped by others of his house. None of that "House Unity" shit. "House Unity" means, even though the Slytherin/pureblood fanboys don't realise it, that you indoctrinate future Death Eaters because everyone will see you as bigots for not opposing Draco in public - and rightfully so.

So, you can't fix Slytherin without changing canon massively. As long as Draco can act as in canon, Slytherin won't be fixed. The only way he can get away with his antics is if he's got the support of the rest of his house. (Or if everyone in his house is an idiot who doesn't realise what Draco means for their image - which pretty much means the whole cunning and ambitious part is non-existent.)
