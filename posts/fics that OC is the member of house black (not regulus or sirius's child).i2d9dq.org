** Does it have to be an OC, or a lesser-known canon member of the House of Black?

**** I don't have much for you then, I'm afraid! I find there's so many members of the family already it's difficult to squeeze any more in, hopefully someone else will come along with some better suggestions!

****** Sure! [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/thewhitebirds/pseuds/thewhitebirds/works?fandom_id=136512][thewhitebirds]] has lots of ficlets around the wider Black family, there's the holiday holly bears a berry linkao3(13034625) and other works by those authors (I generally prefer their shorter fics to their longer ones, but ymmv!) and [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/TheDivineComedian/pseuds/TheDivineComedian/works?fandom_id=136512][TheDivineComedian]] touches on the wider Black family in their works although they're mainly focused on Sirius or Regulus. Actually, if you haven't already read it I'd recommended Blackpool linkao3(14760663), it's my favourite Black family-centric story! I also have a ficlet linkao3(22579573) about Orion and Walburga when Sirius was a baby, if you were interested in that.

  "We don't drown. We float. That's how Muggles used to tell, isn't it?"-When Regulus is five, he nearly drowns in the sea off Blackpool. When Regulus is eleven, his brother befriends a ghost.It's not until Regulus is eighteen and ready to die that the Black family's darkest secret finally unravels. It might, perhaps, change everything.(A coming-of-age story with mind magic, star charting, pink petit-fours, two diaries, and a ghost.)[Edit: SPOILERS in the comments.]
