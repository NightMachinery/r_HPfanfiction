Obviously they couldn't call him Lord Voldemort or the taboo would be useless. So did they just sit around saying 'my Lord', 'our Lord', and 'the Dark Lord'?

I'm writing a fic that takes place a year before Regulus Black joins the Death Eaters, and I just can't see him, Avery, and Snape saying,

'Oh, have you seen Our Lord's shoes tonight?'

'Why, no. The Dark Lord has a new hair style, I was rather distracted.'

'My Lord's pendant is gaudy.'

Edited to include: I'm also thinking internal dialogue, not only conversation.


** The Dark Lord. They don't call him anything else. I believe Draco might have have said "/Him/."

** I'm not going to search the entire series to find every example of how they refer to him, but I'm pretty sure it's almost always "the Dark Lord." The best example of this is probably the chapter in the beginning of HBP where Narcissa and Bellatrix confront Snape. All three of them call him "the Dark Lord" a few dozen times, and as far as I can tell, they don't use any other name.

Also, the taboo wasn't a thing in the first war.

** I think he's elevated beyond ordinary men, so they would likely would not even entertain frivolous thoughts towards him. Especially after he has seemingly returned from the dead. Rather, I think any thoughts of His Lordship / Our Lord / The Dark Lord would always be in reference to how one could /serve/ him or improve their standing in /his/ eyes. Essentially like praying for the good favour of a deity -- except this one has no nose and can rip you apart with a thought.

Imagine you follow a man who has captured the minds of hundreds, orchestrated a take-over of a Ministry of Magic, brought Dark Creatures to his cause, and can communicate with Dementors, of all things. This man has more magical power than you thought a man could even wield, and he has a dominating intellect giving him mastery of most subjects known to man -- particularly the Dark Arts, where he excels and has no equal. He had boasted of magical accomplishments that none before him have performed, and you have seen him perform feats of magic that you never believed any human capable of.

He is, quite literally, the greatest Dark Wizard of your age. And men of such stature are historically referred to as Dark Lords or having some kind of Lordship bestowed upon them. How that occurs is not really explored in canon -- I think I read a fanfic where there are /literally/ Dark and Light magical sources, and the Lord of Dark or Light was essentially the person who captured the "source" of that magic -- I forget the name though.

Anyway, so you're following this guy, who essentially almost single-handedly dominated the magical Government, and just on the precipice of total victory, he gets destroyed by a child in perplexing circumstances and everything unravels because all his power made it all happen, and "your side" was nothing without him.

And then, what, fifteen years later this man returns from the dead after you had all given up on him. And essentially has elevated himself to Godhood in your eyes. He is without equal except for that weirdo Potter who keeps escaping his death by a hairs-breadth for no good reason.

I have had the great displeasure of being in the company of dangerous men when they are incredibly angry. And it's rather like being in a cage with a lion. If you don't appreciate this comparison then you probably haven't met dangerous men who can actually hurt you very easily if they so wished. Even if you are a dangerous man yourself -- there's usually always a bigger fish. And ol' voldy was a titanic-sized shark.

I imagine it's the same for Death Eaters -- /don't look at him, don't speak about him, don't even think about him/.

Like the Madagascar penguins meme -- just smile and wave boys, and hope his Lordship looks favourably upon your die-hard servitude.

*** Very good, I like this. Thank you.

Where I am in the story, yes, the main characters are very respectful and submissive. I can't help but think, if Regulus has a conscious thought before being pulled under by the inferi, he might think of his Lord as a monster. My head canon is the soul is a person's 'magical core' as some writers call it. The spark of life itself is magic, everyone and everything has it, but Muggles and squibs can't access it for some reason. To tear the soul asunder is so heinous, even a young adult raised to be the perfect Black scion is appalled enough to turn against the man he was also raised to adore. I also think simple murder isn't enough to chip a person's soul, fray it a bit, sure, but not fragment it.

Reggie is also gone before that weirdo Potter brat was born and all of that came to be.

I also think the DEs feared Riddle and respected him, but I don't think the older ones, as in older than Regulus, necessarily liked him. I think Lucius Malfoy was just as relieved as the Order when Riddle was gone for those years, otherwise he would have looked for his master himself. Lucius doesn't feature much in my story past him being Cousin Cissa's fiancee and his hair making him stand out like a sore thumb though.

I think Riddle was a suave, silver tongued, charismatic actor to the nth degree and hoodwinked many of his 'friends' into following him until they were in too deep to dig themselves back out of the pit of hell they had merrily followed along into. Right now Regulus and his friends still adore Riddle and are happy to call him Lord, I'm merely thinking ahead.

I very much appreciate the comparison to being caged with a lion, that's part of the reason I'm writing this fic. The path to Hell is paved with good intentions. Even someone who may be a bigger fish, may get snagged in a net and brought down to the size of a minnow. Even Moody's paranoia wasn't enough to keep him safe from BCJ, and I don't imagine Moody being a small fish.

Do you have any stories posted? I think I would enjoy your writing.

**** I haven't got anything posted yet. I expect to start posting some work in the coming weeks when I've finished polishing some of my drafts (beginning chapters and isolated one-shots etc.).

In canon, Hagrid referenced You-Know-Who when saying that he "Didn't have enough human left in him to die" -- directly referring to the Horcrux he created and his imperviousness to death (directly foreshadowing the Horcrux, essentially). You can infer from that that the soul was the source of your humanity / morality. And any Dark Arts you performed in some way damaged the "sanctity" or purity of that thing.

I prefer to think of a damaged soul as volatile, more than anything, which in turn could manifest itself in uncontrollable emotions (and therefore stronger spellcasting?). If you make a like-for-like comparison of soul :-> magical core, then you run into the issue of "what happens to the magic inside a Horcrux when it is destroyed?" and other annoying questions. Is Voldemort less powerful with each one? Does it return to him? These are, I guess, the "unknown unknowns" so you'll have to define it yourself.

Here's an interesting bit from J.K. Rowling's worldbuilding.

#+begin_quote
  "Those who entered to investigate refused afterwards to talk of what they had found inside, but the least frightening part of it was that the place was infested with dementors." ---J. K. Rowling on the early history of Azkaban

  The island in the North Sea on which the wizard prison is built has never appeared on any map, wizard or Muggle. Perhaps its first resident, or even creator, Ekrizdis, practised the worst kinds of Dark magic and constructed a fortress on the island, luring Muggle sailors there to torture and murder them. After his death, the various concealment charms placed on the island faded, and the Ministry became aware of the mysterious site's existence.
#+end_quote

One thing to note: Regulus comes from an /old Wizarding family/, he will undoubtedly have had access to a richer source of Dark Arts material / knowledge than I imagine Tom Riddle would have. Riddle came to Hogwarts having deep familiarity with his own magic, but no knowledge of his lineage/ancestry. He likely had to prove himself worthy to his classmates even with the power he possessed as a kid, my headcannon is he looked up the blackest of the Dark Arts to prove he could learn Darker magic than they could (perhaps in self-defence too) and discovered references to Horcrux, which he would dearly want to know as he was afraid of death. He then asked Slughorn about it all and that's where it all kicks off. Did he know the ramifications of creating a Horcrux? Perhaps, perhaps not. If he did, and risked his life or his soul (or something /worse/ than both of those), then you might consider creating that first Horcrux to be the most courageous thing that Voldemort ever did. He put everything on the line; after the first one, what's one more? He doesn't have enough human left in him to care about the ramifications after that.

Considering these things, it might be useful to use Regulus as a means to explore your own wizardly Dark Arts. Create scrolls and scripture and nearly illegible diary entries making reference to people who tried to create a Horcrux and failed. Or perhaps, in knowing that Dark Arts tend to require something be sacrificed (i.e. your innocence, your morals, blood or flesh of the living or the dead), you can then have regulus ask the question -- what does a person sacrifice when they meddle with their soul itself? It is essentially the blackest of the Dark Arts.

One route to take might be: a long-dead relative of Regulus' worked for the Department of Mysteries, or maybe he was one of those who first explored Azkaban before it was "made habitable" for prisoners. This relative could have left behind bits and pieces of the "Deeper magicks" (or some such). Through which all Blacks that lived thereafter were ingrained with the idea that "You don't ever, ever, ever meddle with your soul. Woe unto anyone who does (and so forth)."

You get the gist. In short: there's some Dark Arts that a Dark Wizard wouldn't ever touch. Regulus grew up knowing this, which makes the Dark Lord's actions deeply offensive to him once he discovered the truth.

Anyway, it's fun material to play around in. Good luck with your story.

***** Thank you, and please let me know when you post.

I don't equate the soul as being like-for-like to a magical core because that would be something /only/ wizards have and I see life itself as a type of magic. I see it as the soul is where the magic originates from, but magic itself is just energy like qi that can be manipulated with physics... quantum physics, but still physics and focus. Different foci makes the magic different. I highly doubt I'll be able to explain it well right now, as it's 2:30 and I've been wanting to sleep for over 2 hours, but I can't, so I write.

** I don't think they ever refer to him as "Voldemort" or even "Lord Voldemort". When speaking directly to him, it's often just "My Lord", i.e.:

#+begin_quote
  ‘There is a little more in the bottle, my Lord, if you are still hungry.'
#+end_quote

-Wormtail in /Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire/, chapter 1.

Then there's the extravagant, brown-nosing way Wormtail also referred to Voldemort in that chapter:

#+begin_quote
  ‘Your Lordship is still determined, then?' Wormtail said quietly.
#+end_quote

When referring to Voldemort while speaking to others, the Death Eaters and supporters often end up using "the Dark Lord", e.g.:

#+begin_quote
  ‘Cissy, you must not do this, you can't trust him --'

  ‘The Dark Lord trusts him, doesn't he?'

  ‘The Dark Lord is ... I believe ... mistaken,' Bella panted, and her eyes gleamed momentarily under her hood as she looked around to check that they were indeed alone. ‘In any case, we were told not to speak of the plan to anyone. This is a betrayal of the Dark Lord's --'
#+end_quote

-/Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince/, chapter 2.

Or they might just use a pronoun, i.e.:

#+begin_quote
  ‘Thought I might be late,' said Yaxley, his blunt features sliding in and out of sight as the branches of overhanging trees broke the moonlight. ‘It was a little trickier than I expected. But I hope he will be satisfied. You sound confident that your reception will be good?'
#+end_quote

-/Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows/, chapter 1. (The 'he' refers to Voldemort.)

There are other examples as well, such as Draco using a pronoun ("him") in book six.

*** Look at you, going above and beyond for me! Thank you! The rest of us has been going based on our memory of canon. I've been capitalising He and Him when Regulus speaks about him, but I may stop now. Why would Reggie turn it into a proper noun if Yaxely doesn't? Still, I think when Reg realises about the Horcrux, he'll /mentally/ refer to Him as something a little less... respectful.
