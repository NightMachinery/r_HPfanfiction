I think [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4152930/1/Dagger-and-Rose][Dagger and Rose]] was good too, but I can't actually remember reading it all too well.

  The Mirror of Erised is supposed to show your heart's desire - so why does Harry Potter see only vague, blurry darkness? Aberforth is Headmaster, Ariana is alive, Albus is in exile, and Harry must uncover his past if he's to survive his future.
