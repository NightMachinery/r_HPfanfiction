You know those fics that are about Harry realizing how manipulative Dumbledore is and wanting to be independent from him? I think that is an interesting concept, but nine times out of ten, those types of fics leave me rather annoyed and disappointed. So much potential and so often wasted.

They frequently turn out to be heavy on the bashing and low on good characterization. Dumbledore? Worse than Voldemort and a conniving muahahaha villain, who schemes to ruin Harry's life and make him as downtrodden as possible. The justification for doing it is often weak and forgets important points. Like the fact that Dumbledore put off telling Harry about something for YEARS because he cared about Harry. Also ....some of the schemes to make him downtrodden and abused just so he can be in love with the wizard world and dependent on him are lacking in logic. Like a fic where Dumbledore told the Durselys to abuse him horribly, so much so that they were hesitant. Ridiculous and stupid. Hey , evil DD, did you ever consider they might accidentally kill him if they took you at your word?

Also Weasley bashing /Hermione bashing. I always wonder why fanfic writers don't consider that The Weasleys and Hermione could be just as much victims of his manipulations as Harry. Do they really expected a sinister manipulator to share his brilliant plan with teenagers (Ron and Hermione). Also why do the Weasleys who have shown genuine concern and care for him in canon wind up being cartoonishly sinister. The only reason I can think of is because the author "HAAAAATES" them. and when that happens I roll my eyes to the ceiling and back-button the hell out of that hot mess.

Here's a thing about writing fanfiction, one often cited when people bring up OCs, but it still fits OOC canons as well. When someone is reading fanfic they are interested in reading more about the characters they love. Not the canon as you think it ought to be with your favorite characters ascended to godhood and your least favorites demonized. (General you here not attacking any people personally). Too many people I feel don't get this. I see so many fanfics where people say "this is my story so ___ will be a jerk if I want them to" and I just think "with that attitude you're not going to get anywhere". You may hate the character but others love them and you're alienating them.

Here's an idea, for this plot. Think beyond black and white. Think about making all the people Manipulative Dumbledore messes with affected, and showing how they're hurt or helped. Harry is not the only person who matters. Also delve into Dumbledore himself and think about why he's doing this. If you have him make a scheme to say manipulate the Durselys to treat him a certain way so he'll do this, think about all the possibilities of that choice and how it could go wrong. Because you know those are the things a scheming manipulator is going to consider. Don't do things just for the sake of drama, then it comes out as melodrama. Which readers will groan and roll their eyes at. Try delving into Dumbledore's backstory and making him into something other than an evil bastard. Maybe even a character who's sympathetic in their own right.

As for Harry, he doesn't have to turn against everyone he ever liked. Those stories where everyone has "betrayed him" or done him wrong and he's all on his own maybe be deep and tragic, but even when decently written they tend to be depressing as hell. And even if a fic is beautiful to you, to the reader, slogging through twenty chapters of misery and angst sometimes it just turns them off. I love angst as much as the next person but it really helps to control how much angst. It'd be like eating a chocolate cake with chocolate frosting and chocolate chips with chocolate chunk chocolate ice cream. MODERATION PLEASE! Even if you have him fall out with his friends, do it believably. Consider Ron and Hermione's side of the story. Remember how Harry feels about them. I'm so sick of "Harry's tired of his friends" fics. Harry doesn't seem the type to just decide, "Okay I'm sick of you shcmucks, get lost" one day.

To be honest I used to dismiss this idea offhand and just hate it. But I've recently realized that it can be good, if done well and with a writer who cares to make it work. I had an idea for a fic like this swimming in my head, where Harry, during book five has a loss off faith and he escapes and ends up in the clutches of someone who is revealed to be worse, and have a him wind up trapped between a manipulator and an even worse manipulator. But, I have too many ideas already. Still, this type of story can be good. Anybody else have any thoughts or ideas about these fics?


** The problem with /most/ fanfiction is that the writers are amateurs. Characters are two-dimensional (at best), clichés are more numerous than Tribbles, and spelling and grammar is apparently optional.

I managed to stumble across a very good one, though.

** You're spot on. People don't understand how to write characters, and tend to write them based on their own personal feelings on the character. Nuances in plot are a lot harder to write than dynamic plot (i.e. Dumbledore is a little good, a little bad vs. Dumbledore is totally evil).

** These fics drive me crazy, too. Harry always demands complete respect from everyone around him, but is a total dickwad in turn. I don't mind reading OOC, even dramatically OOC, fics, but I hate when the story /starts out/ as identical to canon, and Harry is canon-Harry, but then has a complete personality transplant over the course of one summer. It's just unrealistic.

** I found [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8163784/1/The-Well-Groomed-Mind][The Well Groomed Mind]] earlier in the week. Here's the summary:

"On Halloween 1994, Harry learns his mind isn't his own. On Samhain morn, he vows to question everything. Armed with logic and an unlikely ally, Harry makes a last ditch bid to reclaim his life. The goal: survive at all costs. On Hiatus."

I spent two days reading it. I want more. The author projected a 3-4 month hiatus. That was in April. I normally don't read unfinished work because of this, but this one's worth it.

** I actually recently became enamoured of this premise, and I agree - it's promising, it just remains to be done in a believable way. Perhaps, it doesn't hold much of a draw to write because it actually requires very little divergence from the canon texts? (Honestly, this sort of began as a challenge to create an AU in which Remus still dies, but I would have been able to accept his death as justified, as opposed to narratively, thematically, and structurally insulting in it's emptiness)

Because, like, WTF Canon!Dumbledore? WTF everybody else? What is going on with you, and taking baby Harry away from it all, only to bring him back at YOUR convenience?

Yes, he had no living relatives connected through blood, but he had a hell of a lot of friends who were probably very invested in his continued existence, or should have been. In order to explain this inconsistency...my mum and I came up with an elaborate subplot but like, I've never written because...I'm lazy as fuck.

Basically, the subplot takes a few canon details, my own issues with some things, and runs with it. The most important thing being that Sirius Black was Harry's legal guardian in case anything happened to James and Lily. On these grounds, we extrapolated to form an overarching storyline that solves some problems.

October 31, 1981. Godric's Hollow lies muffled beneath a thin blanket of mist. Owls fly this way and that, delivering late night epistles of cheer, and good will. Unbeknownst to anyone, nestled in the very heart of the village, lies the tiny home of the Potters. James, and Lily are awake, having finally put their son to bed for the night. More than once this evening, they contemplated breaking the spell that bound them in secrecy in order to send greetings to their loved ones: Sirius, Peter, Remus, etc.. Halloween has often been a time of great joy, and James fondly remembers several tour de force pranks executed in past years in celebration of this night. But common sense prevails, and the Potters are just getting ready for another solitary night's sleep when the stillness of the evening is broken by footsteps coming up the drive.

James immediately realizes something's gone wrong. They've been compromised. Peter. Something must have happened to Peter. Voldemort has come for them. He tells Lily to grab Harry, and run, while he goes to the front door, to head the villain off. Thrice defiant, perhaps, but his luck has finally run out.

Lily backs herself against the door, as she realizes that James is gone. She has to get Harry out. She'll do anything.

With no escape left to her, she faces Voldemort, head on, as the bedroom door swings open to reveal the cloaked figure. She squares her slight shoulders, and sets her jaw, firmly. If she has to beg, she will. There is nothing humiliating about kneeling for the life of your child.

"Stand aside, you foolish girl!"

But she doesn't. In a flash of green light, she's gone. In another, so is the Dark Lord. Leaving the boy Potter sitting silently in his crib, quite alone, but quite alive.

Across the country, in a small block of flats, Sirius Black bangs his fists enthusiastically against the small wooden door than separates Peter Pettigrew's flat from the outside world.

"Oi, Pettigrew! Open up! Just you and me tonight, mate. Thought you could use a drink, and a toast to the old days," he cries.

When no frantic skittering of feet race to open the door, he becomes worried. If Peter's been captured...Hurriedly, Sirius pulls his wand from the folds of his Muggle riding leathers. "Alohomora."

The door swings open to reveal a deserted flat. There are no signs of obstructed merriment, or an interrupted meal, or anything at all to indicate a struggle. Only the gaping absence of his friend. Of James' friend. Of their Secret Keeper.

He needs to see James. Right now. If he goes to the Hollow, and can't find them, then all is well, but if Peter's...Sirius drops the bottle of Firewhiskey, and mounts his motorbike.

In the end, their house is impossible to miss. It's a charred, smoldering ruin. Everything is lost. And it's all his fault. He should have seen it, he should have known. Pettigrew had been jumpy for weeks, and Remus...Remus...

A short, sharp snap brings his focus back to the blackened heap of tinder before him. A great lumbering shadow picks its way through the wreckage, and for a moment, Sirius is outraged that looters have already begun trampling over the sacred ground. But then, a piercing wail reaches his ears. Harry.

Hagrid approaches Sirius cautiously, sadness, and pity writ large across his features. "Ah, Sirius," he begins, but can't quite seem to finish.

Sirius' eyes are fixed to the poorly swaddled figure in his arms. "C-can I hold him? Can I have him? I'm his godfather."

Hagrid looks hesitant. "Professor Dumbledore sen' me, an' well...I'm ter bring tha lad back, righ o'way, he says."

"I'm his godfather," Sirius repeats. "I'm his godfather."

"S'only, well, s'not my place ter be questioning Dumbledore, yeh know? Great man, Dumbledore. He says it's fer tha best. I'm to meet him there, now."

"Meet him where?"

"I can' say, lad, I can' say."

"Oh, for Merlin's sake, he's MY godson! I'm going to kill him. I'll kill him."

"Now, now, I expect Dumbledore'll be wantin' ter make sure he's safe, is all. You'll see him, soon."

"You mean to Apparate? With a child? Not this young. T-take my bike. Take it." He thrusts the keys into Hagrid's hands, and storms off into the night. He has some hunting to do.

A few days later, Pettigrew is dead, Sirius is in custody, and Remus Lupin is paralysed with grief somewhere on the outskirts of Falmouth. Dumbledore sits in his office, fingering the Cloak that was brought to him, along with a few other minor articles belonging to the Potters that were rescued from the debris, and strikes upon a marvelous thought. It had seemed impossible, but now, now it's practically begging to be realized...

Now, to me, Dumbledore has always seemed somewhat two-dimensional. Sure, he has a horrible past, and he's got some entertaining quirks, but other than that, he's remarkably benign, except for the moments when he does something ridiculous, or, more often than not, really quite manipulative when you look at it. And yet, none of the characters within the diogesis of the story seem to notice, or mind. But what if...

*** What if, on the night the Potters were murdered, Dumbledore saw his opportunity, and took it? Sirius was the boy's legal guardian, and a quick interrogation of him through Legilimancy, or Veritaserum, or a Pensieve would have quickly cleared him of all wrong doing. But that's not what Dumbledore did. Before the smoke had even cleared from the ashes, he sent Hagrid to take Harry Potter away from there, cutting Sirius off from the one thing that would likely have stymied his crazed plan for revenge, the one thing that would have stopped three more lives from spiraling out of control. If Sirius had been met by Dumbledore at the scene, and cleared, and given Harry, do you think he would have run off after Pettigrew? If he'd still wanted to, do you think a Remus Lupin with friends left to live and fight for would have let him? No. So Peter is captured, or else, a high profile fugitive, and Harry gets a stable home life.

We can argue all day about the power of his mother's love, and the need for blood relations to continue it, but how would it NOT have been better for Harry to grow up at Grimmauld Place, secure, and Unplottable, under the care and guidance of two of the most powerful young wizards in the world, with access to his past, his inheritance, and knowledge, all of which which could be tailored to help him prepare for the inevitable return of Voldemort? Besides, if he only really needs two months of Dursley time a year, wouldn't ten with Sirius, and Remus still be better? (Aside from the fact that a book which spends most of it's time talking about choosing family, and loved ones relies on its hero being stuck in an abusive home because of some tenuous bloodline connection? I thought the point of HP was that blood DIDN'T matter?)

But no. Dumbledore, high handedly, and with questionable legality, deposits Harry with his aunt and uncle, and leaves Sirius to fester in prison. The question is: why?

Because Dumbledore is no better than Lord Voldemort.

What is Dumbledore's greatest regret in life? I'd hedge my bets on The death of his sister, and the loss of his love. But, if he were to become the Master of Death, he could bring Arianna back. He could control Grindelwald, and he could live the life he dreamed of on his terms. Too bad Voldemort has a similar plan.

Luckily for Dumbledore, he has two big advantages. One, the Boy Who Lived, and two, the invisibility cloak, and elder wand. All HE needs, is the stone. In the books, he already admitted to a thirst for power being his weakness - what if he never truly gave up collecting all the Hallows? Unfortunately, the Potters are the problem. But they're also the solution.

By keeping Harry with his aunt and uncle, Dumbledore makes him totally dependent on his whims, and generosity in reintegrating him into the wizarding world. Of course, Dumbledore can exert a more complete control over the boy if Hogwarts is the major in, and he, his main advisor. By bestowing the gift of acceptance upon Harry, and teaching him some wonderful (but relatively harmless skills), Dumbledore gains a lieutenant - one destined to face, and in the meantime, utterly preoccupy, the only other threat to the Hallows, leaving Dumbledore free to get the to the Stone.

However, the Blacks, with their fingers in every pie, and their fearless, strong-willed women, will be his undoing. Sirius escapes from Azkaban, reunites with Harry, and threatens to usurp Dumbledore's position of trust, and high regard in the boy's life. So what does Dumbledore do with the astounding revelation of Sirius' innocence? Does he use his not insignificant influence to reopen the case? To push for the clearing of Sirius' name? Sirius, who could be a valuable asset to the reestablished Order? No. He lets him languish in Grimmauld Place, a prison worse than Azkaban. He limits Harry's contact with his godfather, and he fails to provide any sort of remuneration for Sirius' troubles, instead letting the infamous Black madness drive Sirius into reckless behavior. His death was murder, but who is the guiltiest party?

Then, this is where we diverge from canon. Ultimately, I wanted to come up with a way to kill off the characters JK did, but in a way that I felt was more justified, and complex. I've spoken before of how I believe Remus, and all the Marauders, to have been very powerful wizards who wouldn't have gone down as easily as they did without mitigating circumstances - which a young child, and erratic sleeping patterns are not. So, what if...

In the wake of Sirius' death, Remus and Harry gravitate toward each other. At first, just for comfort, but eventually, Harry begins to view Remus as another father figure - incidentally one wiser, and more grounded than Sirius. Whereas Sirius still related to the world, and more importantly Dumbledore, as a boy, Remus has lived a full, and hard, but exceptionally independent life in the interim. He is still willing to please, and desperate to be liked, but he knows his own mind, and he's quick to caution Harry against rash actions, and snap judgements. In fact, he begins to become a bit of a problem when his rational, level-headed advice comes into conflict with the actions Dumbledore urges Harry to take, and the terrible circumstances he continues to thrust the boy into in order to distract Voldemort, and pursue his own ends.

Now, Harry is not as quick to just take Dumbledore's word as gospel. This is a problem that needs a permanent solution.

So he sends Remus off to rendezvous with the werewolves. Why? Precisely because it is hopeless. He knows this man, he knows his weaknesses, and he knows that a task like this will be one Remus is unable to refuse, but also unable to succeed in. Instead, he knows (as he should have done in the books), that Remus will pursue the cause to his own detriment. He will gradually lose sight of himself, and see only the terror of the wolf, he will pull away from his loved ones, and become desolate.

But this war, he is not the bereaved. He has loved ones to miss him, and Tonks, pregnant with his child, and a Black woman in her own right, approaches Harry with vague, but pointed questions regarding Dumbledore's motives. Mentions he should KNOW what this is doing to Remus, and asking why he would do it to a man so close to the Chosen One, so talented, and capable, and yet so vulnerable, and quite evidently not suited to life as a spy.

Harry begins to doubt Dumbledore.

But for Remus, who feels indebted to the man, it's too late, and in the end, he works himself into what he feels, is a grave fully earned, but what is actually one of Dumbledore's own choosing.

Now Harry is uncomfortably aware of Dumbledore's influence, but he doesn't really see its destructiveness until Snape kills Dumbledore. In this scenario, it's assumed that Dumbledore was unaware that Narcissa, another Black woman, would approach Snape, and hound him into performing the Unbreakable Vow (because, really, how did that conversation come up?). Snape, who was as manipulated, and deceived as anyone, accepted the Vow as part of his obligation to Dumbledore to "maintain his cover, no matter the cost." Surely, the greatest wizard in the world could find his way round this tiny predicament when it came to it. But, blinded by his own quest to Master Death, he doesn't, and Snape kills him.

As before, all Dumbledore's history comes out. Instead of spending the seventh book camping, and searching for the Hallows, Harry spends it searching for himself. How much of him is what Dumbledore told him to be? How much is manipulation, and lies, and twisted prophecies, and how much is Harry? Can he trust himself, knowing he's been influenced by someone of such dark, and hidden motives? Someone who systematically destroyed his family for his own gains, and for the furtherance of his control over Harry? How can he justify his worth in the face of that? Does this fight mean anything, if it was just an orchestration of power between two tyrants?

Luckily, Harry has Ron, and Hermione. He may be without his parental figures, or mentor, but he's not without help. He's surrounded himself with peers he can trust, and depend on. And they tell him that it DOES mean something, that his intentions change everything, and that it's up to him to create meaning, and rectify the mistakes of the past, with the revelations of the present. That just because he's been manipulated, doesn't mean he's worthless. That people have lived, and died for HIM, not for Dumbledore, and that Harry is capable of ending all of this. He is still The Chosen One.

Thus, the Harry who recalls the Marauders with the Resurrection Stone is one who performs the actions of Dumbledore (recalling lost loved ones), but with the purity of intentions foreign to DD AND VT. He simply wants their forgiveness. And, more Christian themes, he gets his deathbed confessional, and absolution.

In a moment of final Temptation, Harry realizes that with Dumbledore gone, and the Hallows in his hands, he can achieve what the old man never did. He can Master Death, and he can permanently bring back those that Dumbledore wronged, for surely, their deaths are different than others - they shouldn't have died. They were murdered, they were hunted, and they were cornered by someone they trusted.

But the ghostly family members before him talk him out of it. They tell him that what's past is past. They are gone, but even knowing all they know now, they would die for him again, regardless of whether or not they were defying Voldemort, or Dumbledore.

Harry begs for their forgiveness. They tell him there's nothing to forgive. With their understanding, reassurances, courage, and love, Harry is finally at peace with himself. He is an adult, and he's willing to make the final sacrifice. Of course, we know how that pans out.

**** (Additionally, because I really dislike the 'Molly-kills-Bellatrix-with-sass' thing, there's this:

All along, the Black women fuck up the plans of the powerful men around them. Bellatrix vs. Sirius, and basically everyone, Narcissa vs. Voldemort, and Dumbledore, Andromeda vs. her whole goddamn family, etc., etc.. And in this AU, Tonks is the one who initially puts Harry on alert regarding Dumbledore.

Now, Tonks, who was bested by Bella at the Ministry, and lost her cousin to her, and her husband to Bella's colleagues, among others, REEEEEALLY has a bone to pick with this lady.

Tonks also has recently experienced a Patronus shift. Now, as far as I understand it, Patronii are typically the forms of animals best representing the inherent traits of the caster, so in essence, the caster (and their happy memories) are their own protector. Snape's, which was the animal representation of Lily, is an exception, and Snape is possibly the only DE to be able to form a Patronus.

Enter Tonks, whose new Patronus is likewise, a representation of her LOVE. In his absence, her Patronus takes the form of her husband. Not a werewolf, just a regular, loyal, wolf - Remus' probable form, even had he not been a werewolf. So in essence, unlike the vast majority of anyone else's Patronus, and even unlike Snape's, Tonks' Patronus is a physical manifestation of the overwhelming, abiding, and unbreakable LOVE that exists between her and her husband. A love that not even death can conquer.

Bellatrix, on the other hand, has spent years in Azkaban, in the presence of creatures utterly debilitated by even the most basic corporeal Patronii. She has gone mad, bad, and is Black to her soul.

So what would happen if, in the midst of battle, as she cuts down her enemies left and right, Bella comes upon the mousy, lonely little Auror? She steps forward to confront the girl, and end the shameful line of blood traitors once, and for all.

Tonks is no slouch. She's the youngest Auror to have been admitted to the department in ages, and Mad-Eye's own protégée. Whether or not he was all there in the end, he was hugely respected, and a skilled Auror. Fighting probably broke out in the corridors to gain his tutelage. She's also a Black herself, extremely powerful, and wife to another highly skilled, competent, and powerful wizard.

But she's tired. She's lost so much this war, and has been fighting for so long.

What if, in the heat of battle, after Bella has thrown curse after curse at the young witch, Tonks, in a moment of unthinking desperation, calls out to the one person who always protected her. In a burst of pure, barely controlled magic, Tonks summons a Patronus to run her Aunt down. The wolf springs up, and races at Voldemort's right-hand, ghostly jaws tearing at her clothes, claws swiping at her face, and while no physical marks are left by the apparition, the unmitigated flow of love, happiness, security, and bliss overwhelm her. In a way not dissimilar to the destruction of a Dementor, the Patronus decimates Bellatrix's soul, leaving her completely overwhelmed, overwrought, and utterly incapable of carrying on.

Because no one but a Black woman can take down a Black woman.)

Anyway...that's just...all I have to say about manipulative Dumbledore. Basically, I dig it.

***** I'm not sure if I agree with your Harry masters Death idea. I don't think that characters should ever be given the opportunity to reset things or reverse the damage that has been done. It makes the struggle feel strangely pointless and there really is no reason for the main character not to resurrect his loved ones.

Tonks versus Bellatrix is awesome. It's like the ultimate battle between sanity and the crazy bullshit of the Black family. I don't think it should decimate her soul, just leave her catatonic like the Longbottoms by giving her some perspective on just how evil and disgusting she really is. But frankly speaking, it's a lot better than Molly Weasley killing Bellatrix because that was just ridiculous. Ten years as a housewife with weekend yoga classes isn't going to allow me to beat a US Marine up, so why should Molly Weasley be able to kill a trained Death Eater assassin? Sure, it makes her look good, but it also makes the Death Eaters look /stupid/.

The thing about Manipulative!Dumbledore is that it's very easy to turn him into an incompetent asshole just by using canon plot events. For your idea to work, I think that he would have to be fixated on doing this for the greater good. Give him a /cause/ to rally to, to allow him to slip beyond the moral event horizon.

Ariana Dumbledore's resurrection is not enough of a temptation. What if, in the middle of the first war with Voldemort, Dumbledore cracks from the strain of losing half his friends, the stress of politics and the pressure of protecting Hogwarts. He needs to put too many people at risk, to send children who have just graduated from Hogwarts to fight, and he desperately, desperately wants to find a way to fix all of this when he is done, especially the mistakes that he made. He fought Grindelwald back in 1945, but he did not learn how to fight a war, and so he has never learned to pay the price for opposing a Dark Lord.

Under these stressful conditions, his mind wanders back to the Deathly Hallows. When the prophecy is made by Sybill Trelawney and Snape the traitor begs him, he decides to sacrifice the Potters for /the greater good/, to obtain the cloak and raise Harry as a martyr.

The important thing is to ensure that Voldemort feels like a proper threat. He has to be something like an uber-terrorist, with spies everywhere, mind-controlled minions everywhere and assassins lurking in the shadows. He should never come out and cackle maniacally in the middle of the street. Like his name, he needs to be /known/ but not /seen/.

****** Thanks for the response! I'm amazed you made it through all that text, and I think you made some really great points, should I ever get off my arse, and expand on this.

But just to clarify, I didn't mean Harry masters death so much that he can control it. Only that in possessing all three Hallows he gains the title that VT and DD were racing for. Of course, the Hallows are not as great as they seem to be on the surface, and Harry could never truly reset anything. Just as the brother's love could only return as a wasting ghost, so too would the Marauders, should Harry decide to pursue this course. The idea, I think, is, that the Hallows are the temptation that can never truly be achieved. It's a massive red herring, that should act as a warning against peoples' own folly, and the desire to play god. Ultimately, deciding to "master" death will lead to your own eventual downfall. And that's the course that Dumbledore, and Voldemort pursued, and the one that the recalled forms of Harry's family, and his living friends, steer him away from.

I'm glad you like the Tonks vs. Bellatrix - I think it's SO much more interesting as well! Polar opposites, but cut from the same cloth. It was a battle that was set up by JK in OotP, and never consummated. (Just like the werewolf subplot). As for "decimate her soul" - yeah, I think I got a little carried away with the imagery. I agree with you, it should just cripple her mentally, and emotionally. Leave her incapable, the same way she left others! Nice - poetic justice. Adds another layer!

(But yeah, NEVER Molly. SO many imbalanced pairings apparently had results in canon...like, Dolohov vs. Remus. REALLY? Neville ACCIDENTALLY beat him in the DoM.)

As for Dumbledore, you're right. He can't just be incompetent. But at the same time, he can't just be evil. I agree it's much more interesting if it's something that he began with good intentions.

While I'm not sure political strain would be the straw that broke the camel's back (he did, after all, consistently wield his influence with considerable, and practiced dexterity), I can TOTALLY see the pressure of so many young lives being lost in the war with Grindelwald, as well as the First war with Voldemort, really eating away at him.

Perhaps you're right - with so many young lives being needed to sacrifice, with apparently no effect being had on the strength of the DE's (it's mentioned the Order was just being picked off, one by one, at the end), perhaps Dumbledore slips further and further towards desperate measures.

When he discovers James has the cloak...well, James' background is everything that Dumbledore's isn't. That, coupled with Dumbledore's high-handedness would probably be enough motivation to make it possible that he realizes the possibilities of the Hallows, but doesn't think James responsible enough to be the one to collect them. However, he cannot simply rob James of an heirloom that technically belongs to him. Unlike the Elder Wand, that is passed along through violence and theft, the cloak is a peaceful object, and the only Hallow meant for protection, as opposed to attack, or personal gain. So, when James dies...BOOM. Opportunity. It's not that he intended the Potters to die, but when Voldemort makes this move, it just happens to illuminate the actual possibility of uniting the Hallows to Dumbledore.

If he can just get the stone, then the war will end, and the lives, and loves he feels responsible for losing, can be replaced.

I do think, ultimately, that Dumbledore's motivation has to be selfish, at the heart of it, because that's what links him to Voldemort, and separates him from Harry. Among other things.

But yes, Voldemort as an ACTUAL threat - especially during the first war. This is one of the major problems I have with canon. We're CONSTANTLY told someone is EVIL! or SERIOUS! or COMPETENT! but we're very seldom SHOWN this. Actually, the number of times that what we're told contradicts the events we see is kind of...really annoying.

******* Heheh, no problem. It wasn't difficult to read, I think you explained yourself quite well and you had some really cool ideas.

If you look at the timeline, Dumbledore defeated Grindelwald in 1945. Prior to that event, he seemed to be nothing more than the Deputy Headmaster of Hogwarts and the Transfiguration Professor. Even if he had a Time-Turner, I don't think he would have had time to direct a war or get involved in politics between all the home visits for new students, detentions and Tom Riddle stalking. The home front in Britain for WWII was also never as bad as it was on the continent, and it was said that Grindelwald avoided Britain because he feared Dumbledore.

So in 1945, he duels Grindelwald and defeats him, instantly shooting to stardom and gaining his Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards title. So while he managed to end the war, he's never had to actually /fight/ one. (Which could also explain why Tom Riddle was so contemptuous of him, since he sees the loophole in the Dumbledore worship).

So in the 1970s, Voldemort rises to power. Dumbledore meets the challenge with a capable hand, working with the likes of Amelia Bones and Alastor Moody to combat the threat. But he's never actually had to send people into danger, or decide which targets to protect and which to sacrifice. When he fought Grindelwald, he only had to face his own mortality, but this time, there's too much blood on his hands.

The Ministry of Magic won't work with him properly. Bartemius Crouch authorises the use of Unforgivables, but Dumbledore cannot condone that and has to resort to recruiting from Hogwarts for his Order since there are only so many Aurors he can take from the Ministry. Children are dying and it's his fault, since he's not perfect and he can make mistakes. Voldemort's curse on the Defense job also makes everything harder, since he cannot guarantee that his students will be able to defend themselves outside of Hogwarts.

To make things worse, the Death Eaters are recruiting in Hogwarts. Snape, Lucius Malfoy, Bellatrix and Regulus Black are among these people. He cannot expel them from Hogwarts because it will just send them into the arms of the enemy, but if they remain, they'll continue to spread their poison. He also has to deal with the knowledge that this means that there are going to be /children/ under the masks of the Death Eaters, and that they'll be sent up against their old classmates and teachers.

The Imperius Curse is everywhere. For a man like Dumbledore, who believes in giving people the benefit of the doubt, this costs him dearly. His friends might not really be his friends, and there's no way he can tell. Voldemort is everywhere, and yet nowhere at once. Some people even commit suicide from the stress of betrayal. People are going crazy, and he can't afford to show any weakness.

These conditions should be enough to make anyone crack, and would go a long way to explaining Dumbledore's actions in canon.

******** I fully agree that Dumbledore probably wasn't too involved in the whole rise of Grindelwald, but I do think he had at least some degree of notoriety, purely based on the fact that Grindelwald so obviously feared, and avoided a single person. So yeah, I think you're right about him not actually having fought a war before, and that his main contribution was the duel, but I think it makes sense that he was possibly involved in strategic, and political meetings with leaders from the continent. (As a side note, it'd be totally interesting to get a historical perspective from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang in on this!)

But I think Tom's contempt for Voldemort largely stems from the same place that Harry's does (or should have), and that's his high-handed manipulation, bullying, and commandeering of people and resources, which, yeah, for sure, he totally would have been handed after Grindelwald.

I also have a problem with Dumbledore, and the good guys in general, being against the Unforgivables in a time of war. First of all, sorry, but EVERYONE has to compromise their morals. War is the choosing between two evils. No one can come out of that clean, and it's cheap to not demand that sacrifice of the characters.

However...now that I think about it, it'd be interesting if that was a big hang-up for Dumbledore, and that he recruited from Hogwarts to operate against it. I still think what I said before about Dumbledore's political strength is valid. He's good at maneuvering and manipulating, but, you're right - he's NOT in the Ministry, and he does have to push against politicians who do not revere him, and/or have their own agendas.

Ironically, going to Hogwarts to recruit his army makes him seem more conniving and evil, because seriously, you recruit CHILDREN because the adults whose jobs are much more politically relevant than yours won't listen to you? That's cold, and totally irrational, and presumptuous of you.

I like this theory more and more.

It may be that each sacrifice, and each death weighed on his conscience, but...I'm not sure those deaths would be enough. I mean, recruiting from his own school shows he's quite willing to put his own in the line of fire, a fire that he was quite sure would not be extinguished easily, or through proper channels. So, it's gotta be something else. It might be in there.

I still really feel that his own desire to control, dictate, and direct is what toppled him. The first war wasn't running his way, and he stepped on a lot of toes to organize his own offensive movement. I just don't think he cared about the children that much.

Partially evidenced by his subsequent treatment of James, Sirius, and Remus. He did nothing to alleviate that situation.

He was very open, and generous when it suited him, and when he got adoration for it, but when push came to shove, it was his way or the highway. And in that may lie the key. He DID want a good, peaceful world, and he was sincere in that. He just wanted it his way. And who wouldn't be frustrated with people like Fudge. He sees chaos and darkness breeding, and he KNOWS how to fix it, but no one will listen.

At the same time that his sense of superiority is being encouraged, he develops the belief that he is more capable than anyone else. Why shouldn't they do as he says? He's the smartest, most capable man in the room!

And he doesn't like that being threatened.

Tom was arguably a wizard that could rival Dumbledore, but DD abandoned him. Tom was for sure twisted, and damaged, but he came to DD at 11. He could have been sought out before (his name would have gone on the register at birth), he could have been tutored privately, helped, and guided with more effect. But nope.

Then the Marauders. Three wizards who once again, could rival Dumbledore. What does he do? Stunts their growth at the first opportunity.

I mean, Remus is already beholden to him, and Sirius too. James was the wild-card. With him gone, knock the other two off, and bam.

Look how he treats Hagrid. No offense, but Hagrid is too dim to ever rival DD, but his name is CLEARED after the second book. They should have fought to make that public, give Hagrid some remedial education, at least give him a blasted wand! But nope. It's allowed to remain as is, because Hagrid is more useful to Dumbledore as a lap dog.

I agree that Dumbledore may have cracked during the first war, but I think it's more likely that it was his own sense of power and almost divine right that lead him into chaos, as opposed to the desolation of war, and the loss of life. I don't think he had the capacity to care about anyone that much...

(But I'm really enjoying hashing this out!)

********* The impression I get from Dumbledore is that of a man who's more comfortable with the contents of the Department of Mysteries than the everyday events of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. I think he probably had a reputation in certain duelling circles, and he had probably already started doing research with Nicholas Flamel, but he would have had little political power (unlike Horace Slughorn, whose area of expertise was networking and creating social connections).

I could see him getting called in as a consultant on the magical activities of Grindelwald (such as the construction of the Nurmengard prison, or any particularly nasty spell techniques his soldiers used), but not on troop deployment or anything like that.

--------------

Dumbledore was definitely recruiting children for his side of the war, if the timeline is any indication. Lily and James died at the age of 21 in 1981, and graduated from Hogwarts in 1978. They went under the Fidelius Charm in 1980, and Lily was pregnant, so that leaves a bare margin of two years for their involvement with the Order of the Phoenix.

Voldemort cursed the DADA position in 1956 or so, which means that although the Marauder generation probably suffered less from insufficient DADA education than Harry's generation, they would still have been absolutely /pants/ at Defence.

I know that JKR tends to slam the Death Eaters over the head with the Stupid Ball when they go up against Harry and his friends, but there's no indication that the Marauder generation had that kind of plot armour. It's a bit of a stretch to believe that James and Lily managed to train well enough to keep up with trained Aurors and become sufficiently trusted with missions that were dangerous enough to allow them to cross paths with Voldemort thrice (as per the requirements of the prophecy) within a period of TWO YEARS unless Albus Dumbledore had been up to something in Hogwarts.

One only has to look at Severus Snape to see a parallel. You don't become second to Lucius Malfoy and Bellatrix Lestrange as a dirty common half-blood in the Dark Lord's inner circle within the short period of two years unless you've been cultivating your contacts beforehand.

Is it any wonder why Fudge freaked the fuck out over the Dumbledore's Army suspicion as opposed to any number of paranoid theories that he could have entertained?

--------------

I think Dumbledore did care about people, but he had very primitive and controlling ideas of what it meant to keep them safe.

Look at the parallels between Harry, Sirius, the Potters and Ariana. In each case, Dumbledore's methods of ensuring their safety means hiding them away or locking them up, regardless of whether it was at the Dursleys, in Godric's Hollow, the Fidelius Charm, or 12 Grimmauld Place. Even during the years of the war, the people of Magical Britain prided themselves on the safety of Hogwarts, where their children are literally locked away under the care of Albus Dumbledore in a giant castle (who, by the way, appears to be completely unfamiliar with the concept of psychological damage or ideological dangers).

Voldemort and the Ministry must have hit him hard on both counts. It hurts him emotionally to watch people that he cares about get hurt, and it must frustrate his sense of control to see that he can't just keep them out of the way of danger and other factors beyond his control.

--------------

I don't think the Marauders were ever on the level of Tom Riddle and Dumbledore. But it's possible that the instinctive dislike that Dumbledore had for Tom might have been rooted in issues of control. Tom Riddle appears to have disregarded Dumbledore's authority in every way that he could, and maybe even sought to challenge it. It must have been insulting to be disregarded by a prodigy of his own kind, especially after Grindelwald recognised him as an equal. I don't think it's right to say that Dumbledore was responsible for Voldemort's madness, but it seems like there must have been more to their relationship than mere suspicion, since Voldemort appears to have barely controlled anger issues and an almost instinctive hatred of Dumbledore.

The struggle between the two at Hogwarts never went beyond passive social displays, of course. But it's clear that Dumbledore's dislike might have caused him to damage some of Riddle's plans even when it might have been better to give way. I can't help but be drawn back to the claim that Tom Riddle once made, that he had once asked Headmaster Dippet to let him stay at Hogwarts over the summer.

At the age of 15, Tom Riddle was sufficiently independent to enable him to travel to Little Hangleton on his own. He had already established his gang of followers, and it does not seem unlikely that Nott, Avery or Rosier would invite Riddle to stay with them over the summer to gain his favour. He had already discovered the Chamber of Secrets, and found out about his relation to the Gaunt family and Salazar Slytherin (probably even before he was 15). Just because he appeared to have been sent back to the orphanage does not mean that he /remained/ there.

Therefore, I think it would make more sense if his request to stay in Hogwarts occurred before his fourth year. The reasons that Dumbledore gave were probably true, Tom Riddle did want to remain behind to discover more of Hogwart's secrets, but the historical context of the era showed that there might be something more.

In 25 August 1940 to 16 May 1941, the London Blitz occurred. Germany dropped bombs all over London and killed tens of thousands of people. The bombing occurred while Riddle was in his third year at Hogwarts, but he had no guarantee that the bombing would not continue once he was sent back to the orphanage. We know that Riddle fears death, from his perspective, Dumbledore's interference with his request must seemed like he was sending Riddle to his death, regardless of whether it was due to mere ignorance on his part about the Muggle side of the war, or a complete lack of concern.

That summer must have been agony for Tom Riddle, and it could be a plausible cause for his distrust to flare into outright hatred.

********** It's great to see Riddle in context - I mean, the fact that WWII was happening seems to have had little effect on the wizarding population, with the exception that it overlaps with Grindelwald, which would have obviously been more preoccupying to wizards than some ordinary Muggle war. But I think your observation of Tom believing that Dumbledore was sending him to his death is spot on! A child who'd grown up in a Muggle orphanage, living in one throughout the Blitz, would surely have seen it that way.

And it's that sort of action that makes me believe that Dumbledore fundamentally didn't care about people, that he was much more selfish, than selfless. Because, for a man so wise, and so powerful, it should be a mere assumption that a child of 13 would be able to be protected from such brutal reality, that he would not be sent back into the fray, and a reasonable request (such as staying at Hogwarts) would be seriously considered, no matter the underlying goals of the child. But Dumbledore didn't step in to do that. Of course, with Dippet as Headmaster, it may not have been his place, but his dismissal of Tom, after his initial contact, seems very cold.

Presumably, he was, at times, involved in the Grindelwald situation, though, I agree, not necessarily deploying troops. I do think he would have been consulted on occasion, due to his reputation though, in the way you suggested. But if he was not, as I think we agree, on the front lines, so to speak, then he should have retained some responsibility for the goings on in his school. Hogwarts seems pretty liberal in its application of rules, punishment, and teacher interference - it's just they more often choose to look the other way. But if you have a known troubled student, actively recruiting some other dangerous students, looking into things that should be far beyond his ken, then you should probably pay attention. At the time, though, he didn't seem to be of any particular boon or bane to Dumbledore, and so he was passed over.

I like the idea of Tom challenging Dumbledore more and more openly while at school, and it only further convinces me that DD simply took exception to, as you said, a prodigy in his own vein that refused to be controlled or directed by him. While Tom took it the complete opposite direction, and rose up as the Dark Lord, it still stands as a testament to the power DD held over him.

And though, admittedly, it's my own extrapolation that the Marauders were, or could have been on par, I think there's plenty of textual evidence to support this. But there are some key differences in their relationship to Dumbledore that effectively renders them more or less impotent.

For Remus, it's his lycanthropy. By the time DD approaches his family to admit him to Hogwarts, he's already given up hope. Suddenly, one of the most renowned wizards tells him he can have everything he dreamed of...on conditions. So of course, Remus is entirely beholden to Dumbledore. And we see the ramifications of this in the books: He returns to Hogwarts, after 13 years of solitude, at DD's bidding; he goes underground with the werewolves (though it's the thing he's, ironically, LEAST suited to) at DD's bidding; and ultimately, he fails to do anything without the consent of the man he feels he owes his very life to. It must have been impossible to act at ALL without feeling unworthy, or disgusted with oneself in the face of that; to think that every moment of your life is owed to the service of someone else.

However, he's shown to be genuinely powerful. He can perform wandless magic, he deliberately sabotages his own Patronus out of shame (altering already extremely complex magic), he helped create the Marauder's Map at the age of 15 - an article we never see recreated in any other way, he manages to make it through almost every battle completely untouched, and, like you said, this includes the first war where it is unlikely that anyone was particularly skilled. In many ways, he's shown to be superior, BUT also stymied - his shame, and his devotion to Dumbledore have crippled him, and he cannot ever fully embrace his power.

Sirius, on the other hand, is obviously gifted. I mean, likewise Marauder, mastering Animagus transformation at 16 (which we can assume to be a huge feat, since very few wizards manage it, despite its obvious advantages), etc., etc.. His problem is that he's a Black. He's been irrevocably twisted by his family, and he's on the verge of madness. This is a powerful wizard always on the verge of being out of control, and who'd rather punch you in the face than learn complex magic.

James, we can assume, as ringleader of the group, was at least on par with these two. However, he was blessed with a loving family, a great home life, and a fairy tale girlfriend. He had no want, or love of power, being quite comfortable as he was, and so never pursued it in the way that Tom or Dumbledore did. Simultaneously, this balance is the most threatening, because should he acquire the motivation, he has the least distance to travel to become quite threatening. Conveniently, for DD especially, he's the first to die. And, if he's defied VT three times, as we're told, he's obviously capable of being a serious threat to him at the ripe old age of 21.

Basically, DD's treatment of the Marauders succeeded in almost all the ways his treatment of Tom failed. He coddled them, and manipulated them, and locked them away, and plied them into subservience. That's exactly what he tried to do with Harry. Unfortunately for him, Harry had The Marauders, and Tom to act as counterpoint examples, while DD's increasingly selfish bid for power became more and more overt, and less careful.

I think I agree with you about DD's primitive ideas about caring. So perhaps I'll have to adjust my stance on that a little bit. I think he cared about a few people - his sister, for one. Gridelwald, and perhaps even Tom, and Severus. And I agree that his method of locking people up is his idea of safety, and one woefully misguided. However, I don't think he cared about those who fell victim to his manipulation. I think it was sort of a self-perpetuating cycle. He picked those that might rival him, worked to subjugate them, and those who resisted him earned his respect, while those who didn't, and did exactly as he wanted them to, only earned his scorn, because how could they rival him, how could they be worthy of him, if he could walk all over them? And that's why I think his treatment of the Marauders, and their generation, speaks to his callousness, and greed more than anything.

He definitely had noble goals - he did want to end the killing in Grindelwald's time, and he wanted to provide Tom with his magical heritage, he wanted to give Remus education, and Sirius an escape. He wanted to stop Voldemort's reign of terror, and he wanted Harry to survive...

But he wanted it all done HIS way. And he was ruthless in his pursuit. Whereas Harry (& perhaps, Remus), might question the cost of such endeavours, DD was quite willing to sacrifice a whole generation in his bid to stop VT. A bid that was also misguided - you cannot win a war with a small, guerilla group of teenagers with next to no defensive training). But he failed to reevaluate the situation, and, at James' death, he aimed only to capitalize on it for himself.

I just don't see him as being at all caring of the lives of those beneath him, but do agree that the frustration of defeat after defeat at the hands of his once pupil, and possible protégé, as well as having to watch the Ministry struggle due to outright incompetency, must have been nearly debilitating. He likes to win. He likes to win HIS way. And he doesn't care how much that win costs. This is especially possible if his desire to attain the Hallows and master death was so ingrained into him that he failed to connect to others partially because he felt the consequences of their demise was not permanent. What did it matter if a star pupil died? Once he'd achieved his goal, he could bring them back forever. They'd be grateful, and he'd be hailed as a god.

As you said, he doesn't seem to have any clear idea on psychological damage, or ideological concerns, and I think this extended to his ability to connect emotionally. He had distanced himself so much, and become so arrogant, and controlling, that the lives of others didn't matter - once he was a god, he could give and take life at will.

While Tom was motivated by a fear of death, Dumbledore was motivated by a desire to control, and bestow life.

**** Ignore them. Give it a try. It's not for everyone, but Sitman and Luellasindon's criticisms are greatly exaggerated.

The whole "JKR was wrong" thing is taken largely out of context. Dementors, according to JKR represent depression, but she never said as much in the books. According to the author of HPMoR, the HPMoR dementors represent death.

MoR is a good fanfiction, but not if you loved the original books, because it does take a lot humor at their expense, largely because the books didn't age well. As the books went on, the justification for people's action became less and less "This is the best thing we can do with what we have" and more "This will advance the plot".

What should turn you off is that it gets very dry at times, especially in the early chapters. HPMoR is not about making a good narrative (although I think it does that). It's about demonstrating the methods of rationality and their uses.

I think the low point of the series is when Harry teaches Draco about Mendelian genetics. Originally, the possibility of multiple genes didn't get mentioned. In the rewrite, it did, which made the whole sequence longer, and less emotionally impactful.

Once you get past that, though, it's a really good story that asks you questions about what it means to be good, what it means to be "responsible", the price of being a hero, and the nature of sacrifice.

It's not for everyone, but it's a lot more than a lot of fanfictions out there. There's a reason why that subreddit has 2.5 times the amount of subscribers as this one.

******** I sort of agree. I hated how the author made transfiguration temporary. Not only does it introduce more problems then it solves, it also makes transfiguration almost useless. I would have made transfiguration permanent, but incredibly hard to perform.

My personal pet theory is that hp magic is a kind of conceptual manipulation of platonic forms or something. Wizards manipulate reality on some kind of conceptual level which produces physical results.

That's why I find the way the author approaches hp magic really annoying. He treats it as a sort of scifi hyper technology. I sort of want magic to be more metaphysical in nature.

Sorry for the rant haha. It's just that HPMOR makes me so mad because the author basically butchered the setting.

**** You should give it a try. JKR is wrong about quite a few things, primarily the whole of the Deathly Hallows book (which is a fantastic example of how not to write a novel). He doesn't mean it in the 'lol JKR sucks and can't write' way, he means it in the 'this would have been better if it was done this way' sense, which is one of the premises of fanfiction in the first place.

It's easier if you think of HPMOR as an Ender's Game/Harry Potter crossover, and you can skip the Philosophy/Psychology 101 lectures in the story if you feel that it's way too hamhanded (which it kind of is, really). It's also a fair example of a Manipulative!Dumbledore, who actually has real forces of politics and evil to contend with. He's not impotent simply because Harry chooses not to listen to him.

******* IDK I heard he did from someone I talked to and avoided it after that. Maybe that was silly of me, but idk personally as a writer people who state things like "the author is wrong and I'm right" just really irk me because it seems so disrespectful. I mean it's one thing if they say "this is how I prefer it." but it's another to act like you know better than the original creator and they're just wrong and you're right. Or that your version is "objectively superior."

Like there was another Manipulative Dumbledore/badass Harry fic that is good and clever in the fact they did second person well. But it turned me off because (well aside from their Weasleys are trying to trick Harry and control him, and Ginny is a promiscuous love -potioning cheating bitch) throughout the story it included spiteful (and obvious) Take That's at the canon and how it's soooo inferior. That ruined it for me, and I couldn't take the story or it's author very seriously.

Disagreeing with the author is one thing, being spiteful in it is another. Trust me, I hated how the DP series finale(and Danny /Sam) went down and felt it ruined a lot of characters (or changed what i felt made them original) But I'm not going to include bits in a DP story where Danny becomes a bitter OP Gary Stu who decides he hates his friend and tells Sam she's a shallow poser bitch. Because, that would just make me look immature.

He has Dementors represent death instead of fear or depression or whatever. The symptoms and appearance of dementors could fit death, or so he says. Not that JKR is wrong. in thinking they represent depression or whatever. Just that in universe they fit death just as well.

***** Please. Unless it's been completely re-written since the last time I tried to get through it, this fic boils down to "Harry is more clever than anyone else, ever. Anything Harry does is good, while anything that anyone else does that disagrees with Harry is bad." Adults in that fic go out of their way to bully other students who disagree with Harry, which is completely unrealistic.

So many of the things you listed in your original rant apply to this terrible fic. **edit: SeraphimNoted is not OP, pay better attention, Luella.

****** Correction. The fic boils down to, "Harry /thinks/ he is more clever than anyone else, ever". And that only remains true until he gets caught up in more adult situations. Not everything that Harry does is good, Azkaban being the most glaringly obvious example of how much of a dumbass he can be.

No adult ever bullies students for disagreeing with Harry. Quirrell encourages people to mess with Harry, Flitwick thinks he's a gigantic source of trouble, McGonagall is protective of all her students and Dumbledore actually disagrees with Harry, so he has no reason to bully anyone who feels the same way.

HPMOR is not perfect. It does not deserve all the hype it gets (ERMAHGERD RATIONALIST IMPROVEMENT OF MAGICAL WORLD). But that does not mean that it is not also a damn good story.
