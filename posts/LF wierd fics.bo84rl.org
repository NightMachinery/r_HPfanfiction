Looking for fics that make you say "man, the HP fandom truly has everything".

Completely ridiculous or highly unusual premises welcome.

Harry transfiguring Pokémon? Sure.

Harry living as an elf because he thinks that the is one? Why not.

Grindelwald trying to make up for WW2 by helping against Voldemort but constantly getting in trouble because his followers assume that he's conquering the world? Great!

Harry getting saved by a superhero Zorro wizard who's only alive because of Harry's wish and some weird time travel? I'm loving it!

Linkffn(The Very Best by BrilliantLady; Fantastic Elves and where to find them; Returned, Reformed and Really Trying; Harry Potter and the Deus Ex Machina)

** linkffn(Blurring Reality by Terrific Lunacy)

Hogwarts is a ballet school that is putting on a performance called 'The prophecy'. The play is cursed in a way. As time goes on more supernatural elements are introduced and characters slowly start losing their sense of reality and understanding of which world they are in (real world with no magic vs. the characters in the play that they are performing).

Has some great character portrayals with some seriously tense and well written action scenes. This fic is incomplete though.

*** Oh god, this fandom really has everything.

This reminds me of some other meta stories:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6034766/1/The-Serpent-and-the-Mirror][The Serpent and the Mirror]]. Dumbledore is a Psychologist, Harry is his Patient and the wizarding world is only his imagination. But what is really the source of his imagination? What secret does the Potters hide?
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10129276/1/Dangerous-and-Deadly-Lord-Voldemort][Dangerous and Deadly Lord Voldemort]]. Voldemort is only a man's alter ego and doesn't really exist.

​

it's both abandoned and a crossover, though. general premise of the story is that Harry is adopted as a baby by Deadpool. with all the craziness that implies.

includes a scene where Harry rips off a potion recipe from Shakespeare, with an army of Pikachu coming out in the process. who, with the aid of a basilisk in a pokeball, captured by harry, rob gringotts bank at one point.

** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8484470]]) you may like "Potter Who and the Wossname's Thingummy", given the other things you listed. It's confusing, but not so much as to make no sense, and I found the mystery appropriately creepy and whimsical, like good Dr Who episodes are. I think it's abandoned, but the author also updates geologically slowly.

****** Here's my theory.

We know that Filch is a Squib. He KNOWS he can't do fuckall here. I think he's at Hogwarts because (at first) he was hoping that being around so much magic would eventually let him somehow gain magic of his own through sheer proximity, or at least improve the odds of one of the other "cures for squibdom" working. Dumbledore presumably let him in when he was younger and desperate for SOMETHING, ANYTHING that might give him a chance, Dumbles couldn't bear to be the one to crush his dreams, but decades of getting no results whatsoever has left Filch angry, bitter, and spiteful.

**** Well, she was humanoid or can take humanoid form... Kinda like a furry but feathers. That was weird because like, no one fucking care she like poses and shit like a weird bird like creature ebing seductive to harry is a daily occurrence.p in public.

Not like a reverse animagi version I came across or like the one where Harry became an animagus and thought it is a good idea to boink his owl. I think I even came across one in Tumblr where bird hedwig broke up with Harry for cheating on with a kid.. (like a juvenile goat)

Yup! The overgrown bird Humanoid Hedwig takes the Cake for weirdest shit I've read.

***** I could see the avian-furry version or the harpy version I saw once appealing to certain niche audiences on the internet (weird, but not the weirdest thing out there), but there's no way nobody in-setting would comment on it (unless Harry's reputation was already so incredibly absurd that something that ridiculous was OBVIOUSLY just "business as usual with Harry")

i dunno though, the "owl hedwig breaks up with harry for cheating on her with a young goat" sounds even weirder than "furry!hedwig"...?
