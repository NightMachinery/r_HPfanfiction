Looking for drarry fanfiction that takes place during hogwarts and would prefer it if Harry is slytherin, but I'm okay if he's not. I don't care either way if Harry is dark or not either.


** Well, this is a bit vague, but if you're looking for something that goes through at least part of their Hogwarts years with them in Slytherin, perhaps these? Admittedly, I haven't read them or Cunning & Ambition in a long time, though.

- linkao3(785942), "For the Price of a Soul" (& the sequels)
- linkao3(909865), "Ice Poppies" (2nd in a set, but the first one is pre-Hogwarts)

edit: Removed "The Spellmaker", sorry - I remembered that what was written was a best-friends situation.

  Five years have passed since Harry Potter was adopted by Remus Lupin. This time around, Harry is learning about what it means to be at Hogwarts while also finding out his own potential. Those around him are willing to help in any way they can, but they have to be careful so that he is not caught in the crossfires. All the while, Harry is learning about his elvin magic and hoping that he will be ready when his creature inheritance finally comes with his best friend, Draco Malfoy, but his side.

  Latin; a dead language with no practical applications except perhaps the deciphering of old texts and as a particularly quaint party trick. Thankfully, as Harry finds out, Latin is not as dead as he was first taught when he decided to learn the language. It wouldn't have mattered anyway, of course; he loved Latin, and would have been proud to know it even had it been as useless as it was pretty. But in the world of Wizards, the world of Magic, Harry realizes his rare talent with words is particularly valuable in the highly complicated and controversial subject of Spell Creation, a subject he soon becomes enamored with despite having to hide his interest from everyone. Besides, it's not like he's going Dark, after all.
