  AU Harry Potter based after the war with Voldemort has been won, Bill and Fleur did not get married before the end and decided to wait until after it was over. Also Harry and Fleur had a relationship during the Tri-Wizard tournament, but Harry's drive to fight Voldemort and keep Fleur safe ended the romance. Certain characters will be slightly different than in cannon so be warned.

  It all went wrong. Harry was locked away in Azkaban for decades as Voldemort destroys and conquers the magical world and beyond, unchallenged. However, Voldemort's greatest strength will be used against him when Harry is sent back in time with one mission, to kill the Dark Lord before he rises again.

  When the battle of Hogwarts is over, the secrets of Harry's status in the world are revealed. At 17 the thoughts of inheriting a royal title, and being part of a marriage contract are all that occupies his mind. However, when a new political evil is revealed, Harry must stand with his new friends to face down a familiar foe. The course of history is changing.
