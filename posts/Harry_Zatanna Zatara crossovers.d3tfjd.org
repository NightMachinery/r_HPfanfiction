  Finally free from the Phantom Zone after being trapped for years, Harry Potter finds that the world has changed greatly. After years of being put in life or death situations, can he adapt to a peaceful life now that Voldemort and his followers have long since been dealt with and he is finally free from his prison, or will he find a new purpose and be more? Book 1 of the Emrys Saga.

  Years ago he was killed by the dark Lord Voldemort when the protection ritual his mother used failed, transforming her into Poison Ivy. Brought back by his mother with a combination of science and sorcery as the son of Ocean Master and Poison Ivy, will Harry rise above his tragic past, or will he fall to the darkness that lives in every one of us? (I don't own anything!)

  Blackfire was about to arrange for her sister to marry an ugly swamp alien only for a contract to appear before her. After reading the contract she realizes she had no choice but to go along with this but she the groom was not what she expected. This is just a one shot. I do not own anything belonging to Harry Potter or DC Superheroes.

  10 year old Harry Potter was granted powers by The Wizard Shazam to fight against evil. Now watch as years later as he uses his powers to fight against super villains as the sidekick to Captain Marvel and fight alongside Young Justice.

That was my first story of more than 1000 words, it's pretty bad, the spelling and grammar are horrible, but it does have Zatanna and Harry (and Hermione)... for at least this chapter.

***** I remember reading it and loving it so you did something right. I've read most of your work and it's absolutely amazing and you have one of the (if not THE) best Ron centric fic. Plus your stories are very diverse in terms of plot imo.

But I digress.....

Apologies for the fanboying 😂
