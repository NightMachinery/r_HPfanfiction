I'm looking for completed fics where Harry is powered up significantly from canon, but the challenges he faces are tailored to his new level. I've read Wastelands of Time and the Unforgiving Minute. (the latter of which is probably my favourite example of this type of fanfic)

Any suggestions?


** The linkffn(Sword of the Hero) trilogy and the linkffn(Denarian Renegade) trilogy are exactly what you want.

** Wouldn't this even out his "super-ness" for lack of a better word? The whole point of reading a Super!Harry story is seeing how he overcomes great obstacles easily.

*** Not necessarily. You can also just want.. /epic/.

Watching Harry face a normal Voldemort with Expelliarmus and Stupefy is well and good, but reading Harry and Voldemort fighting in the skies above London with lightning and hellfire is rather exciting too, and different!
