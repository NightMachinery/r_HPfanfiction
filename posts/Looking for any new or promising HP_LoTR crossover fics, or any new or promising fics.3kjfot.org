I've read The Shadow of Angmar by Steelbadger and The Next Great Adventure by Taure. They're both HP/LoTR crossovers and I felt surprised when I really enjoyed them. Any similar crossover fics to recommend? Barring that, any new, good fic recs would be welcome. The only caveat I have is that it's not slash.

Thanks!

#+begin_quote
  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

  Harry sacrifices himself to Voldemort in the Forbidden Forest expecting to die. Instead he wakes up in the Third Age of Middle Earth, lost and confused. Realistic crossover with canon Harry. No power-ups, elfling Harry or tenth walker. No slash.

** Linkffn(Not Quite A Maia) is pretty popular

Linkffn(onto greener pastures and brighter skies)

Linkffn(Harry Potter and elves most fabulous)

These have humor moments in them and are pretty unique I think at least. All very good reads

  Harry Potter has done it: he has defeated the Dark Lord. Yet this victory has come at a great price: namely, the eradication of the entire human race. Wizards, muggles, and creatures alike perished and now Harry is alone left, cursed with the title of the Master of Death and an extended life. So, Harry does what any wizard with too much time would: he goes "traveling".

** Well, as you might be able to tell I quite like Harry Potter/Lord of the Rings so I'll dump some of my recs:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10951863/1/The-Lonely-Company][The Lonely Company]]. I was so excited when this appeared and updated so quickly. It's such a pity the author rarely seems to complete stories and has already lost interest in this one. The world needs more Harry LotR in it.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8879660/1/Doomsman-s-Herald][Doomsman's Herald]]. It's Morta's Priest. 'nuff said. He needs to get off his arse and write more of it though!

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10473466/1/Fate-be-Changed][Fate be Changed]]. This is a funny one. It has all the makings of a terrible story but I just love it to bits.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1357912/3/There-and-Back-Again][There and Back Again]] and its rewrite which mostly covers stuff unmentioned in the original, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4403118/2/Elda-Kundu-Kurutar-A-Wizard-s-Tale][Elda Kundu, Kurutar: A Wizard's Tale]]. Unfinished and the original returns to the HP-verse far too quickly for my liking but it's decent enough.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8697214/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Third-Age][Harry Potter and the Third Age]] is a bit rushed and the pairing is dubious if I remember it correctly. Still not too bad.

Also, two of my HP/LotR stories have already been linked, so I may as well link the third [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11027086/1/The-Power-He-Knows-Not][The Power He Knows Not]].

  A decade ago Harry Potter found himself in a beautiful and pristine land. After giving up hope of finding his friends he settled upon the wide plains below the mountains. Peaceful years pass before a Ranger brings an army to his door and he feels compelled once again to fight. Perhaps there is more to be found here than solitude alone. Harry/Éowyn.

  As the Master of Death, Harry cannot be taken by time. His friends were allowed to live out their lives, while he remained unchanged until they finally passed on. With nothing left to live for in his world, he sought out a new world, where he will find new friends and more danger than he's ever been in before. Middle-Earth might never be the same again, after Harry's done with it.
