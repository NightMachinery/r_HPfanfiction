I like the Edward Cullen/Harry potter fic 'emerald twilight' for example and the dean/Harry supernatural/hp one 'you leave the world behind' and the sam/harry one 'respites never last' Also 'time to save the world again' with link (from Zelda) and Harry and any of the Glee guys with Harry (ditto for Harry/any of the lotr males) and also 'the case of the man who was wanted' (that ones Harry and sherlock). I also like araciel and reighosts crossover fics of hp and avatar, katekyo hitman reborn, fantastic beasts and others

I came across two fics featuring Harry finding slash romance in the batman universe as well which i thought was good

I'm looking for any more of the same above and have yet to find a good slash fanfic from crossovers of hp/hunger games, divergent series/hp, fifty shades/Hp, avengers, iron man, or Thor/hp, as well as hp/game of thrones, Hannibal/hp, final fantasy/hp, kingdom hearts/hp for example

I like crossover hp slash fics where it's like an alternate universe, your own personal headcanon, or Harry and the other guy from the crossover universe are written in the story as the endgame pairing even if one or both have a female love interest in canon (with Harry we know it's Ginny for example)


** If you like Criminal Minds (and Actual Daddy™ Aaron Hotchner), linkffn(12544437) is pretty cute.

You want some X-Men? Wolverine? Some Harry/Logan? I got some Harry/Logan for you: linkffn(8467360)

Oh shit, you want X-Men but /not/ Wolverine? Here's some Harry/Cyclops for you then -- linkffn(10096802)

But really, like [[/u/fflai]] said, more info would be good. What do you like? What kind of fanfiction are you looking for? Do you want fluffy feel-good? Do you want mpreg (please say no)?

** There are a lot of stories that will fit that criteria. In fact, the Harry Potter fandom is so popular for fanfiction that there aren't any big-ish fandoms where you won't find a slash pairing for Harry.

Are there any fandoms you prefer? (Twilight, Marvel, Hunger Games, ...?) What kind of story do you want? (fluffy and happy, dark, action- or character-driven, ...?)

More info will probably lead to more enjoyable recommendations.

  With Voldemort defeated and Harry turning seventeen, the elder Weasley boys decide to give him a chance to be a normal teenager for a while; namely, by buying him a ticket to Malibu, California. But of course, Harry Potter can never do anything normally. Especially not once he meets Tony Stark in a club, and begins a holiday romance that leaves him with more than just memories.

**** [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/4148136][*/Of Wizards and Heroes/*]] by [[http://www.archiveofourown.org/users/storyforsomeone/pseuds/littlelightsinourheart][/littlelightsinourheart (storyforsomeone)/]]

  Centuries after that fatal day of the battle of Hogwarts, Harry Potter has fallen into legend, a bedtime story parents tell their children, a name whispered around campfires. He wanders the world alone and immortal, until one single reckless moment sends him hurtling into a parallel dimension of heroes and villains. A new enemy arises from an ancient power, and Harry must take a stand as the last wizard to protect this new world. If only SHIELD would stop trying to track him down...and someone could explain what the hell was an 'Avenger' was supposed to be. Honestly, muggles...

  Agent Harry Potter is a menace, Logan's sure of it. It doesn't matter that he's absolutely charming, or that he smells like almonds. So does cyanide. COMPLETE.
