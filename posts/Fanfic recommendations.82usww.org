My favorites are: The Life and Times, A Difference in the Family: the Snape Chronicles, Commentarius (I hated the beginning but most of it was good) Black Comedy

The fic needs to be well written, very long (200k+) and preferably heart-wrenching.

I don't particularly like stories with young characters or retellings of harry's hogwarts years. All pairings/maturity levels are good.

Any recs? Thanks!


** Try linkffn(Harry Potter and the Untitled Tome). Been my favorite for the last year or so. After linkffn(What You Leave Behind) was abandoned, it's supplanted it in the magical exploration genre.

The Untitled Tome is a large scale au that rewrites the British wizarding world, and has a very curious and inquisitive Harry. It also involves organized duelling, a deeper exploration into wizarding culture, and no Voldemort. I really recommend it

Edit: Just realized you specifically asked not to receive retelling of Harry's hogwarts years. Didn't see the not. Apologies. Still recommend the fic though.

  The Battle of Nurmengard ended in a stalemate. Half a century later, Harry Potter feels adrift in a world teeming with millions of fantastic folk. Armed with a talking wand, he forays single-minded into the noble art and sport of Duelling, until one book leads him on the path to discovering his ill-fated parents' efforts to conceal a most dangerous magical secret.

  The Mirror of Erised is supposed to show your heart's desire - so why does Harry Potter see only vague, blurry darkness? Aberforth is Headmaster, Ariana is alive, Albus is in exile, and Harry must uncover his past if he's to survive his future.
