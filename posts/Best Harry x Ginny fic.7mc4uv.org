** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5677867/1/Ginny-Weasley-and-the-Half-Blood-Prince][Ginny Weasley and the Half-Blood Prince]], linkffn(5677867), is fully canon compliant and Ginny centric. It's very well written and has a strong canon feel to it. It's also the story that got me interested in HP fanfics.

  The story of "Harry Potter and the HBP", but told from the 3rd person POV of Ginny Weasley. Strictly in-canon. Suitable for anyone whom the "Harry Potter" novels themselves would be suitable for.

** Anything by Brennus, but I'll recommend a few specific ones.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9631998/1/The-Thorny-Rose][The Thorny Rose]] and its sequels seem to fit what you were asking. Told mostly from Ginny's perspective, she's much more manipulative for a very good reason. linkffn(9631998)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10645463/1/Hail-Odysseus][Hail Odysseus]] features a darker couple. Harry and Ginny against the world sorta thing. linkffn(10645463)

From other authors...

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4740107/1/Ginny-Returns][Ginny Returns]] She travels back in time alone and defeats Voldemort, but then has a harder time with her love life. linkffn(4740107)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4101650/1/Backward-With-Purpose-Part-I-Always-and-Always][Backwards with Purpose]] in which Harry, Ron and Ginny go back in time. It has a lot of angst, but I enjoyed it at the time. linkffn(4101650)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5856625/1/The-Return-of-the-Marauders][The Return of the Maurauders]] is not for everybody. There's a lot of things I didn't like about it, but generally I'd say it's worth a read for a H/G fan. Only James died that night. linkffn(5856625)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2505393/Epeefencer][Epeefencer]] has some decent H/G stories. Mostly just fluff though.

Edit: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2559745/1/Learning-to-Breathe][Learning to Breathe]] features a Harry that has already beaten Voldemort. The downside is, he never developed his social side so he's a pure soldier. Full Metal Panic meets Harry Potter.

#+begin_quote
  Harry has been entered into the Triwizard Tournament against his will, and his friends don't believe him when he insists he didn't enter his name. Will Ginny Weasley sit by and watch him suffer alone, or will she risk exposing the dark secret she has been hiding. GoF re-write from Ginny's POV. Smart & slightly manipulative Ginny! Extreme Ron-bashing!

  James sacrificed himself to save his wife and son. Sirius took them into hiding and trained Harry the Marauders way. Neville became the BWL. That doesn't mean that he's the Chosen One. This is a AU story. Harry/Ginny MA Rating
