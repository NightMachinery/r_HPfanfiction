I did like the opposite of this characters whose misdeeds are overlooked.

But I wanna just not focus on characters who you don't like so other way around.

Underappreciated in specifically fanon not canon.

So I count that as doesn't have that many stories focused on them.

My choice for example is Regulus Black. I feel like there are more minor characters that get fleshed out now like say Daphne or Blaise or Marlene McKinnon. So Regulus could be used more ( and I wish he was more).


** I'm probably starting to annoy a few people these past few days, but Lavender IMO. I don't want to bash on people's preferences, but just /why/ does Daphne, who /barely/ got a mention in canon, get this whole...actual characterization -- so much so, that one might forget that she hardly got a sentence dedicated to her in canon -- while Lavender is just girl number x in Harry's harem? While Lavender is just /"WON-WON"/? I mean, it probably is JKR's fault, to begin with, for destroying the girl who was completely broken down over her pet rabbit's death, who is super into divination, who cried because her favourite teacher was about to be forcibly removed from the castle. There's so much to work with without having to completely invent an entire personality for her. I fell in love with her character after the Binky scene because I felt so bad for her. She deserves more love in the fandom. She deserves to be more than /"WON-WON"/ and she deserves to be more than the blonde bimbo airhead of Harry's harem. 😤

*** While I actually like Fanon!Daphne, I agree with you about Lavender. She basically became a simple conflict point for Hermione and Ron's romance. Not that it made RON or HERMIONE look good either, Book Six was just garbage in general.

***** That's actually on my list at some point. A Diviner!Harry story where the Divination class is actually valid, the class deals with incredibly complex spells for seeing distant locations, reading the history of objects, all sorts of stuff like that. Where "Prophecy" is not all there is to Divination, and in fact a very tiny part.

Funnily enough, that fic has me wavering between Lavender or Parvati as a love interest. Or, in a hilarious scene, they agree to share him and Harry's mind breaks in two.

****** Someone recently recommended to me a fic, which I'm not going to share since it's a Tomarry with a Tom that rapes Harry in front of his crew to humiliate him, but they had some really cool divination tactics such as seeing the past, the present and the future in potions or in the fire and if you looked long enough they could become really addictive and destroy one's mind. I thought that was a cool concept regardless of the dark themes that chased me away from the story.

Edit: to give you an example. It's obviously a fic about Harry time travelling and ending up in Slytherin, but the reason he ends up in Slytherin is because he sees himself in the fire as such and becomes so obsessed with the idea that that's his destiny that he doesn't even fight it. I thought that was pretty cool.

Why, on the other hand, reduce Lavender to what she has become in fanon, when you have things about her you can actually work with (except for what JKR did to her in HBP)?

*** She /is/ meant to be a blonde bimbo airhead though. In canon, all we know about her is that she's girly, giggly, likes gossip, clingy, gullible, and that she doesn't believe Harry in OotP. Lavender has no character depth at all. Even Parvati has more potential in her. She's been shown to be fierce, compassionate, and reasonable. She stands up to Umbridge, believes Harry, and feels bad after she laughs at Ron's joke that made Hermione cry (unlike Lavender). No offense, I honestly don't know why people love Lavender so much when she's basically just a caricature of a silly teenage girl.

None of these things are necessarily bad things, though? Being girly, giggly and enjoying gossip is nothing to be ashamed of, being gullible isn't necessarily a negative trait either. Clingy might be difficult to deal with, that's true, but, again, not necessarily a bad thing. Plus, she later joins the DA and fought with the DA in the BoH. Almost no one believed Harry during OotP.

I'm not saying Lavender is perfect or anything, but I see the potential for an actual person there and not for whatever JKR intended with her.

***** Yeah honestly I hate how a lot of the girls are treated in canon, which spills over to fanon. Being gossipy is mainly Hermione opinion and actually extremely normal for all high schools students of all genders. Like Hermione may chose to not do her hair or make up but girls can like those things and also fight when the time comes. It's just this is never questioned as Hermione is the main girl and the other main girls are somewhat similar. Also like hermione/Harry/ron/even Ginny at times are largely preoccupied with Voldemort or Sirius every year so yes all the other characters priorities and concerns seem ridiculous in comparison but they are just normal. It's also the internalized misogyny of JK too cause what about the boys only concerned with sports while the trio is fighting evil?

***** Oh, I'm not trying to say that those traits are bad. It's just that she has no other traits to emphasize unlike Parvati. It's like how in the first book, Hermione is a caricature of a bossy know-it-all. Those traits aren't bad, but it gets rather annoying eventually, so Hermione was shown to have other integral traits to her character like her strong sense of justice and morality.

A girl who loves fluffy animals, who cares with all of her heart, who isn't afraid to show how much she enjoys a class others think is a waste of time. But no, JKR had to go and pull the WON-WON on Lavender and destroy her character in its entirety. She was more of a real person in books 1 to 5 than in 6.

Kingsley is imo the forth most powerful member of the Order (Dumbles, Snape, Moody), and according to my own head canon he would beat Snape in a straight up fight. In Deathly Hallows he was the second person Voldemort personally persued after Moody.

Flitwick is a half goblin who is described as very empathetic and is a dueling champion. Sprout loses a student, but we don't know anything about how the Hufflepuff dealt with Cedric's death.

Snape was a spy, but he acted off camera.

Sinistra studied in Uagadou (I guess, because Uagadou specializes in transformation and astronomy) and with the opportunity to introduce ourselves to another school of magic, JK misses that.

But since I wasn't taking any classes with them I couldn't even point them in the hallways back then. Also there are other professors that, even though you take a class with them, they are still so plain and their subject is so uninteresting that you completely forget about them. Usually it's the professors that we really admire (Dumbledore, McGonagall, Lupin, fake-Moody, maybe Flitwick), the ones that we really hate (Snape, Umbridge, Lockhart) or those that provide some novelty (Quirrell with his turban and stuttering, Binns being a boring ghost, Trelawney who always tells you you're going to die or Hagrid in whose class you could actually die) that we remember. So yeah, I think if the professor was not in those categories in Harry's mind, he didn't give a shit about them and we have little to work with.

Edit: actually Harry didn't give a shit about Quirrell either until he started suspecting that Snape was trying to coerce him into getting the Stone.

I think part of that is because you (probably) attended a large school. I went to school in the same building from kindergarten to twelfth grade. My graduating class had 49 students. I knew every single teacher and every teacher, even if I wasn't taking their class, knew me, even if it was just as A's older sister, J's younger sister, or S's daughter.

> they are still so plain and their subject is so uninteresting that you completely forget about them.

That's definitely true. Even when I knew their names, I didn't really think about my teachers as whole and complete humans until I was much older.

Amelia Bones, not just in the fanon, in the canon too. I mean, she fight with Voldemort and Tonks tell to us (to harry) that she is nice and just. She wasn't in the order of Phoenix (why?) and she was (probably) a Hufflepuff, like Susan. Why all of cool hufflepuffs are dead in the saga?

Millicent Bullstrode is another underappreciated character, I think is in a part because she is always used as anti-hermione character, but can we talk about that fat and halfblood woman/girl who used her streght and her body like a tool, whose last Name is in the sacred 25 and was selected in Slytherin (and she is part of the Pansy's gang)?

Percy Weasley is another underapreciated character, he was always ambitious (and Molly always incentivized that -he was THE mommy's boy-) but always (ALWAYS) was worried for his little sister (CoS) and brother Ron (I loved when Percy ran to meet Ron in the second try-out of the triwizard tournament). For him, his family always was first, and only walked away from his family when his own family chose someone else (Harry, who was right) over him.

Peter Pettigrew isn't the useless that all people think.

AND FILCH. He is the only person without magic who is relatived important, apart of the Dursley. And I think he could restore paintings (if my memory don't fail to me).

** PARVATI & PADMA ***** I really really want to see more fanfics that have Parvati and Padma as more prominent characters with good characterization. I think it's interesting that they as twins are not in same house. And I think they have a lot of potential. Despite not being part of the trio and mainly doing normal teen things (which gets demonized by Hermione...like why can't 13 year olds giggle and enjoy divination). parvati defends Harry and Neville in the 1st year and joins the DA and fights in the battle at hogwarts. Padma also is in DA and fights and I think they both helped Harry mess with the speakers during Umbridge? Also I think something interesting could be done with parvati interest in divination or how trewlany says she could be gifted as a seer. Also parvati lost her best friend during the battle. And Labender is underused or used to be the less likable girl and that's not fair.

BILL/FLEUR*** As a couple are both pretty interesting accomplished people. I wonder about them meeting and what attracted them to each other and what they were like when alone. They also come from seemingly different types of families and possibly a bit of language barrier and cultural difference that could lead to misunderstandings. And they both fought with the order and stuck together. Also possibility of giving characterization to Gabrielle. Oh and they both the oldest sibling. Oh and she's part Veela!

ANGELINA ***** There is so much potential there as someone who is very sporty (again a different type of girl from Hermione and Lavender/Parvati) and is good friends with the twins indicating she prob has an outgoing personality, prob witty to keep up with them and likes the same kind of jokes. I feel she could be written as headstrong, outgoing, sporty, popular, a fighter, very funny/witty, doesn't care much for rules but cares for what is right. Also her and George relationship I imagine as very interesting with Fred's death as she prob had to help him through that while also having lost her own close friend. I think ppl shit on her for marrying George but her and Fred didn't date they were just friends and she was also friends with George and George also clearly wanted to marry her.

BLAISE ZABINI ***** I really like good characterizations of Blaise I've read a couple where he's prominent but I think he's very interesting. He's not seemingly from a death eater family and is apparently very smart. His mother is known to be very beautiful and a black widow making him wealthy. (This is canon right?). That's super interesting and it sucks that no one really writes about that as far as I've seen. It sounds very slytherin as far as self preservation but doesn't revolve around blood bigotry and being a death eater. It also makes u wonder why...was she cursed, is this intentional, was she abused/hurt by a man, was one of her kids, was she initially very poor or always wealthy. And is it canon he has sisters or no? I've read fics where he has lots of sisters and it makes u wonder who their dads are, what their relationship is with each other and their mom and how they feel about it. Blaise also is very reserved it seems. Malfoy can't help but go on about himself but Blaise seems to have lots of composure and much better at masking emotions. We can also assume he's very good looking cause of his mom and Pansy describes him as very picky. I've seen him be written as bi or pan which I've liked. He is prob very cunning, stylish, charismatic, reserved, calculating, clever, maybe not very trusting even with those close to him, suave, slick, prob kinda pretentious and likes the finer things and will admit it. Given his family situation it would be interesting to think is he less trusting of men or women. I've seen him written as like a very suave guy who likes to drink and have fun and flirt and crack jokes when he's comfortable and a lot less severe than other Slytherins in some aspects (not a death eater, not as aggressive or willfully violent but will obviously defend self if needed). I think a more reserved ladies man is very interesting since in media in general the loud ladies man is common. Oh and if Blaise does or is written as having multiple siblings it can be wondered if him and Draco act differently because Draco only child. Or if Draco is also emboldened by how his parents dote on him vs Blaise may have a very different relationship with his parents.

REGULUS* Very interesting to me though I haven't sought out fics with him much as I'm preoccupied with post hogwarts Voldemort wins ones. But I find the dynamic between the Black sisters and Sirius plus Regulus super interesting as a dysfunctional family but also young people in a dying toxic aristocratic family with extremely rigid expectations of behavior and severe punishment for noncompliance during wartime. Also NARCISSA/ANDROMEDA/BELLATRIX as far as their relationship to one another when they were young and how the decisions of one affected the other. I wonder a lot about BELLATRIX/RODOLPHUS relationship dynamics.

PANSY* I don't necessarily need more of her the way I long for more of the others as indicated by *, but I think she's someone who could have a very strong personality which is interesting at least to read. She is pretty mean in the books but it comes off in a way that seems deeply insecure and overcompensating. She was def insecure about Draco and it makes me wonder how other Slytherins viewed/treated her and what her family is like. It doesn't ~justify~ being a bigot or hateful but it's interesting and different from other female character personalities. Like all characters chose different methods to fix problems/cope. And I like reading about ones who maybe pick more flawed methods. (Unrelated to fanfic just in general I get tired of reading about the protagonist adult woman or love interest who is always so ~good~ and ~righteous~).

** Percy Weasley, Regulus Black, Peter Pettigrew.

In my opinion, they could be written as amazing, multi-dimensional characters, who struggled with their choices in life, and yet they're not very popular and most of the time if a story includes them, they lack the conflict and their choices are much more straightforward than what we know from canon.

** Lavender Brown, particularly in a universe where she survived her injuries post Battle of Hogwarts rather than the 'dead in movies, not confirmed in books' limbo her character is in according to canon

Ernie Macmillan, Seamus, Dean and Justin Finch Fletchley: I want more fics with this quartet during the Hogwarts takeover in seventh year with these guys joining Ginny, Luna and Neville as major members of the DA in the trio's absence

Hannah Abbott, Susan Bones gets a surprising amount of coverage in canon but I've rarely seen fics featuring her best friend Hannah in a major role. She's in the DA IIRC and her mother was killed in Half-Blood Prince as far as I remember, so giving her a main character viewpoint could show off those internal struggles and resistance motives.

Colin Creevey: okay, I admit, I'm hella biased (look at my flair lol), but I feel like he could have a character arc of coming to terms with Muggleborn prejudice and living up to the Gryffindor name. His pivotal act of sneaking back into Hogwarts to defend it (even though he was underage) and sacrificing his life to defend the castle could make for a really powerful chapter or oneshot. I have a Colin WIP in progress, so again I'm biased.

Trelawney: I think more 'eerily prophetic' scenes involving her would be cool, and a bit of background into her life as a Seer and creator of the Chosen Prophecy would be especially awesome. Plus, Divination classes are a ripe opportunity for comedy in fics that is all too often missed.

I could keep going all day but that's what I've got for now. Hopefully this inspires somebody to write a story on one of my favourite underrated characters!

** I'm going to say Neville as a main romantic interest. I've read a handful of Neville fics where he is in the main pairing and they are great! You've got a character that transitioned from a brave-but-fumbling teenager to the leader of the Hogwarts rebellion, but it was all off-screen!! I think there is a lot of space to grow his character.

*** Same! I love Neville as main romance interest. So much can be done 7th year, but I feel like there's a lack of interest in paring him with someone. Maybe it's because Hannah wasn't as intriguing or they got together after the war (so it seems). But even Neville/ Luna isn't very in-depth a lot of the time :( though Luna is hard to write so I get that. Like you can love Luna as a character but struggle writing her.

** Nymphadora Tonks outside of a romantic love interest. Fanon, and even in Canon. She turns into a love interest even though there's so much more to her. She's clumsy, she has a sense of humor, she seems pretty competent. She was trained by Moody (I want stories of her training days, dang it!). She joined the Order.

But in fanon: She's either Remus or Harry's love interest. In Canon once she becomes Remus love interest, she's pretty much not there as a character, and it's just disappointing.
