in my case since I read many stories featuring Daphne I can't help but always match her to a certain appearance in my head similar to how I imagine any of the other main Characters looking like their movie selves and In her case it's always Taylor momsen (rock singer and previous actress) in that Hogwarts age period [[https://imgur.com/ffcYHof]]


** I have my own idea of how Harry looks because everytime I pick up a fic, it sometimes gets to the point where the author changes his appearance so much (or never describes him at all) that I just drew how I think he looks because I get confused and my imagination starts to fail me.

** I always have pictured theo as that tall and lank with thick warm brown curls. I figured since he was fairly solitary he never put on a ton of muscle playong quitting and would look kind of like a British hipster.

Technically all I have to go off canonically is "weedy" "stringy" and "rabbity". Which isn't much.

Ekaterina Shiryaeva is also a strong contender for Fleur - in some of her pics, at least, the ones where she has a more natural look without too much of a tan. In many of her pics she's too "golden blonde" rather than "silvery blonde". But I can't find a SFW pic of her which fits.

**** He would have been such a good casting choice, I think. He's Danish, so can speak English with a slightly Germanic accent. He's a good actor and has established ability to play a complex villain. He's charismatic enough to play the leader of a revolution. He's attractive enough that you can see how Dumbledore would be infatuated with him (notwithstanding that Dumbledore was most attracted to his mind/talent). And Game of Thrones was popular enough at the time of FB1 that he would have brought some star power to the table at the time of being revealed (though admittedly not as much as Depp).

** On the Marauders Era time travel reincarnation fic I am writing.

Harry as taller Daniel

Charlus Potter(Harry's father) as Patrick Stewart

Fleamont Potter as Jeremy Kemp

James as Books described. Though Remus, Sirius and Peter are definitely the young versions of their actors. Haven't found someone I think looks like young James anyway.

Lily Evans as Rosie Leslie

Arcturus Black as young Christopher Lee

Young Bellatrix as Katie McGrath(who I also think would work as female Harry)

OC Gabrielle Dubois(Appoline's younger sister) as Chloë Grace Moretz

The rest of the characters have their own descriptions mostly book, I am only certain on Harry, Charlus, and Arcturus.

** Yes! I have very specific ways certain characters look(i.e, Harry, Draco, Luna). It's a thing I always do.

For my examples, bc I can't draw:

Harry has messy hair, but my main idea is that he actually has really curly hair it's just that, since it's cut so short, the curls don't complete themselves or lay flat, and therefore it gives the untamable hair. In a lot of my stories, Harry actually grows his hair out, and this becomes clear. His eyes change shade in different lighting, so while they do normally appear emerald, they can also look anywhere from jade to a dark, forest green. His hair, is certain lighting, actually turns a deep red, because his hair has a red underlay. It also creates the appearance of his hair being a warm black rather than neutral. His skin is very pale, which makes his scar and hair stand out even more. His scar is a more, almost cartoonish lightning shape. He's very short and skinny, a product of be malnourished. His face is round, and it's very obvious when he blushes. He carries himself very loosely, but if he's nervous his whole body tenses up.

Draco has his hair almost side-swept, but it's all very neat and slicked down with a shit ton of hair products. His hair actually shines is some light due to the amount of oil he puts in it. His eyes are actually silver, but it's not much different than just having gray eyes. His skin is pale and almost looks slightly gray. He's overall a very light color pallet. He's tall and thin. His face is sharp and pointed, and he doesn't blush, not really. He flushes, but only just enough that his cheeks turn pink. It takes more than a second glance to catch it. His posture is generally very tense, so it's hard to tell if he's nervous.

I'll put Luna later.

*** Draco sounds like he ran out of blood

Honestly I have a similar look for him tho, except he uses powder makeup to not look red cos white people can't avoid that naturally. Also I dont slick down his hair because I hate the mental image, he grows it out instead. He's got the Malfoy chin, nose and colouring, but the Black eye shape (large, lidded), bone structure and lips. He grows from looking a lot like Lucius to looking more like Narcissa. Also I make him androgynous looking, and very tall.

** I always imagine harry to be at least a head shorter that most boys. And after third year I imagine him with shoulder length hair that he ties into a ponytail and messy bangs that fall all over the front of his face. I imagine this for multiple reasons. 1) Harry's hair grows SUPER fast, as mentioned in the books so at one point i imagine he's just goes ‘fuck it' and just lets it grow out . 2) it makes it easier to hide his scar.

I sometimes imagine snape to tie his hair half up and ware rectangle framed glasses. I also imagine him as tall and relatively slim with a daunting presence. I also think he would look a lot younger than Alan rickman, so like his mid 30's.

I imagine fleur with silvery hair and an almost ethereal beauty as she is part Veela.

Imagine Remus as a man with messy dirty blonde hair and bags under the eyes. I also like the idea of him having a comforting presence but slightly sharp teeth and strong fingernails.

Sirius is a handsome but older looking man with unruly shoulder length black hair and sharp features. I also thong he has a bit of a wild glint in his eyes and smirks all the time.
