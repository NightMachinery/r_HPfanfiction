Hello every one I am looking for a good Evil!Harry fic. And I am not talking about a Dark!Harry but an evil one. Three points are very important: 1) No slash. I just don't like it, I have nothing against it but don't want to read it. 2) No Fem!Harry. Same point as above. 3) Hermione is no friend of Harry. If it's Hermione Bashing it's better. But I just don't want her to have any friendly relationship with Harry. And contrary the above points I have so many things against this annoying bookworm but that's another topic

Thanks <3

  Harry Potter is disappointed by the Wizarding World. A society wielding powers beyond imagination and it is wasted on Politics and Games. A psychotic Harry Potter aims to remind the world what it means to be a Wizard and to judge who is Worthy of Magic and who isn't.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

  When Loki fell from the Bifrost he was expecting the cool embrace of oblivion, not to become a spirit and then be ripped apart and forced into the mind of a six-year-old named Harry Potter. With no physical form, he must keep the boy alive if he seeks to keep existing, and everyone knows that the best way to ensure continued survival is to simply become greater than everyone else.

***** Emperor is an excellent dark!Harry fic in which he is not friend with Hermione. In fact, she's not an important character at all.

The amount of strategies and tactics employed by all sides is huge.

****** Very well I will give it a try.

Off-topic. Do you also know fics where Hermione is either not a friend or not important. Harry doesn't need to be evil.

******* Emperor is definitely worth reading and I am pretty sure you will love it, but fair warning, I would hardly describe it as "Evil" Harry.
