** Hermione appears to be schizophrenic, since she keeps flipping between being a genius and all around perfect person who is madly in love with Harry, and an obnoxious fool who is only pretending to be Harry's friend in order to spy for Dumbledore and help him destroy magic by fighting racism.

Remember, that as a male Veela who has chosen his mate, Draco will die if the relationship is not promptly consummated.

****** sidenote, reminds me of a funny bit in a fanfic that pokes fun of other fanfics.

#+begin_quote
  Harry quickly scribbled on a bit of spare parchment:

  /Ronald Weasley and Harry Potter agree to share a period of eating known as breakfast. Breakfast Succession: After this contracted meal has been ingested, responsibility will fall to Hermione Granger to clean up after them for perpetuity, lest her magic wither and fall barren./

  Ron read the parchment and grinned. "I've always wanted a house elf!"

  Hermione actually looked panicked, which made Harry inwardly amused. Honestly. If they lived in a universe where contracts could suck the magic out of people that didn't even sign them... how on earth would Voldemort even be a threat? Give Harry five minutes with a quill, and the rest of the story would feature an antagonist named 'Voldesquib'.

** Harry was scared.

Before him was not Dumbledore. No, it could not be. Clearly, this was an Impostor, like Moody was.

Right now, the Impostor was monologuing, and Harry was quietly searching for an escape route so that he could find actual Dumbledore.

"-yes, yes, my boy, you will go rot... em... live at the Dursleys, my boy. For the Greater Good, yes, my boy, so that I can sacrifice you like a pig I do not care for, of course. ...My boy. You must remain weak and helpless for that to happen, naturally-"

It was not just what the Impostor was saying, no. It was everything else as well.

His usually merely twinkling eyes were now radiating light at full blast, like two miniature suns, blinding Harry and his usually calm state appeared to have been substituted with a deranged one.

"-obviously, also you must not know about your humongous, pulsing magical core that I restricted by sacrificing sixty nine phoenixes, all Fawkes's brothers, as well as blood of fourty nine innocent virgins. After all, it was for the Greater Good, of course-"

Finally, Harry could listen no longer and he bolted from his chair towards the door.

Upon reaching it, he opened it as he always had, running full-tilt down the moving staircase.

The last thing he heard was the end of Dumbledore's ramblings, before they were cut off as he turned the corner.

"-he found out he is the heir to Hogwarts, I need to obliviate him. MY BOY, WAIT, FOR THE GREATER-"

Clearly, something was not right here. He would investigate further.

He is alarmed when he investigates some odd noises coming from a broom cupboard and finds his godfather groping Remus Lupin in an excessively pornographic and physiologically impossible manner.

[[/r/hermioneisverysmart][r/hermioneisverysmart]]

For no apparent reason other than that the author thinks she's cool, Nymphadora Tonks is hanging around the castle. She greets Harry with a cheery “Wotcher, Harry” despite this phrase having fallen well out of use in the extremely localised areas of the UK in which it was ever employed in about 1983. Her hair changes colour 5 times a sentence and wow she is so cool.

[[/r/hermioneisverysmart][r/hermioneisverysmart]]

“Morning Harry” says Neville in the amiable, pleasant way that amiable pleasant characters have when they're being included because they're in the books dammit, and it's not essential that they're dialogue is delivered by one of the golden trio. “Have you seen the blonde?”

“Huh?” Harry frowns obliviously over his mother's green eyes and, y'know, the scar.

“The blonde” Neville repeats, gesturing at Draco Malfoy who can't be called Draco too many times in a paragraph.

Draco sneers at Harry in a besotted sort of way and grinds out the word “Potter” in a hateful, adoring, venomous, besotted tone of voice, before telling his father about this, doing something pureblood-y and hatefully kissing Harry full on the lips.

Harry takes his seat, dizzily, his scar burning, to find Ron has, indeed eaten all the sausages.

** “I'd like to visit my vault, please.”

Wide-eyed and astounded, the goblins gathered round.

“He said... please?” A goblin muttered.

“The p-word!” Another said, clearly astounded.

An elderly looking goblin, shorter than the others but with Dumbledorian hair began to speak, “We must name him as a Friend of the Goblin Nation. Show him our secrets, give him discounts, and a free checkup at our mediwizard that happens to be ready to extract horcruxes.”

“No, no.” Another disagreed. “Let us name this human who we don't know, don't trust, and doesn't know our customs as our KING! After all, no one has ever spoken politely to any goblin in a thousand years, not even muggleborns who don't know wizarding prejudices.”

“We should also give him access to the Potter-Black-Peverall-Gryffindor-Slytherin-Ravenclaw-Hufflepuff-Gaunt-Emrys-Le Fay Seat that grants him control of the Wizengamot, Hogwarts, and ICW. Ya know, because the wizards gave us, the people that constantly go to war with them, the ability to decide who controls their human government at any time. It makes perfect sense!”

The goblins bowed to their new leader, befuddled as he was.

“Uh- I-“

Before he could finish, the goblins carried him away to rule over them and the Wizarding World.

And that, children, is why you should never be polite to a goblin.

Hermione starts gushing over Harry and saying how handsome he is, then switches to worshipping all authority figures and saying she's also spying on Harry for Dumbledore so she can get his money. She and Ron have a loud conversation about this just around the corner from Harry.

Draco and Snape START acting NICE. Snape starts acting like he's Harry's dad or something, and Harry is creeped out.

The goblins come and tell Harry he's the heir of 1000 houses and has 10000000000000000000 dollars.

Dumbledore overuses "For The Greater Good," and "It's a slight misunderstanding." for every awkward situation.

** There's an extra bed in the dormitory occupied by a boy who looks identical to Harry but he has a slightly different shaped scar and hazel eyes. No one finds it unusual that he is there, though James Jr. himself wonders why Harry is at Hogwarts and not Durmstrang. He appears to be an arse though, so Harry is relieved when his new twin brother leaves with Neville, who also has a scar on his forehead and looks gloomier than ever.

Harry heads down to the Great Hall for breakfast but is waylaid by his parents, who are inexplicably alive but even more dismissive of him than the Dursleys. Close behind them is Sirius, who seems to have forgotten Harry's name in favor of calling him “pup”, and Remus, who is casting longing glances at Sirius.

Ron has become an incredibly stupid and yet incredibly manipulative death eater overnight, who has been trying to murder him since morning.

Hermione is flying above him with a scepter, the perfect image of a goddess. Oh, and she also wants to get into his pants.

And then he makes the mistake of looking into a mirror.

His ebony black, shiny and messy, yet handsome looking hair falls over his eyes like a thin curtain. His cheekbones are high and aristocratic, his skin is the perfect shade. HE has a weird tattoo on his neck. It was only then that he notices his hands, which are weighed down with a bunch of rings.

And his eyes! Oh, his eyes! His blazing Avada Kedavra green eyes, like pools of emerald fire pierced into him from the mirror, looking right into his soul. They were the most beautiful things he'd ever seen - he himself was the most beautiful thing he'd ever seen.

Anyone would've fallen for that face in a heartbeat.

By chapter 9 I published a comment: Best Dumbledore representation while dealing with a manipulative!Harry SO FAR. Highly recommend it. The beginning may be a little confusing or so I felt it, english is not my main language so may be easier for you. No romance as far as I remember, tooootally worth it.

Edit: sorry I misread it, is not a do-over but I still recommend it to you.

** All of them are different fannon versions. You have a brain dead Ron who does nothing but eat constantly and messily which worries canon Harry greatly because Ron doesn't act like that. indy!hary manipulative Dumbledore who thinks he has these big complicated plans that were grown over the course of decades but don't exist in this world. Seer Luna who knows everything and is extremely cryptic. Wbwl gloryhog Neville who thinks his parents died and Harry is a normal kid and everyone is confused because he keeps saying he is the bwl and throws tantrums bc nobody is basking in his glory. Mentor father figure Snape who is all of a sudden really nice to Harry which obviously freaks him out. Drarry Draco who thinks they are married and in love when they definitely aren't. All three black sisters who are in love with Harry and also think they are married. Cat person Hermione. Super friendly dog-like Basilisk who likes hanging out with Harry. Etc I'm running out of cliches here but you get the point, a bunch of different cringy cliche fannon characters all interacting at the same time with Cannon Harry.
