You know, like drawing a circle on the floor and burying a feather in cool soil under the full moon at midnight. Lighting five white candles and repeating an incantation with a blood relative. More occult or drawn out stuff than just saying magic words and pointing a wand. I'm fine with most pairings, but I'm not up for smut unless it's slash.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

#+begin_quote
  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

** Two that haven't really been mentioned.

1. linkffn(Harry Potter and the Untitled Tome) has a very well thought out, intricate magic system including rituals in their magical field/religion theurgy.

2. linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lightning Scar) has Native American inspired rituals, and is an okay but not good fic.

For a much more... primitive, I guess, version of rituals involving herbology, check out linkffn(Harry Potter and the Forest of Valbone).

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.
