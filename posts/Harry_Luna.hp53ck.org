#+begin_quote
  Harry is struck with the killing curse and wakes up the day of the Last Task. This story will be the Order of The Phoenix if Harry had been a bit wiser and Luna a more present character. No time Paradox and no godmoding. Slow build up. Also, the tanslation in French is available by Eohwel.

  For his 21st birthday, Luna has a surprise gift. And it's nothing Harry could have ever expected or predicted.

#+begin_quote
  Harry knew Luna well...didn't he. This is a little oneshot, featuring what could have been on the night of Horace Slughorn's Christmas Party. There are no lemons, but there is a rather intense discussion of more mature themes. Just a little lighthearted snippet, with spades of fluff, along with a bit of humour (I hope?). Harry x Luna This is not stolen, read the Author's Note.

#+begin_quote
  Harry doesn't expect to enjoy his fifth year back at Hogwarts, and would just as soon be alone on the train... but a few hours with a certain blonde Ravenclaw may have an unexpected effect. A "what-if" variant, grounded in canon, but also inviting you to explore the possibilities. For anybody who appreciates H/L as friends and/or a potential couple.
