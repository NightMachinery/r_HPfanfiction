Looking for Harry/Barty fics. Preferably completed. The Fanfiction Asylum(TFA) reports that 44% of its residents come there because they enjoyed a fic that was never completed, and the suspense took over their everyday lives, until they simply couldn't focus anymore, and they turned themselves in.

  Harry had never been able to comprehend a sibling relationship before, but he always thought he'd be great at it. Until, as Master of Death, he's reborn one Turais Rigel Black, older brother to Sirius and Regulus. (Rebirth/time travel and Master of Death Harry)
