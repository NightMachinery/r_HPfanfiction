  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

  After his death, Remus finds himself 5 years in the past, having undone Voldemort's defeat and Teddy's birth. Heavy on Remus/Sirius friendship. Some Black family dynamic; Harry/Sirius family dynamic; Sirius PTSD exploration. Tonks is a major player but not til halfway through. No bashing. Harry is present but not primary; these adults prefer not to ask teenagers to save the world.

#+begin_quote
  Hedwig is a very smart owl; none would dare deny that! So what is a very smart owl to do when she finds her human's living conditions unsatisfactory? Finding a new home is top of the list. Finding a mate for him is right after it. After all how is an owl supposed to justify having owlets if her human hasn't had children of his own yet? Very much a humor fic, no bashing of anyone.
