Hey there,

Is there any Fanfic where the characters behave a little more like the original ones? I know that if everybody behaved normally, the events would be the same as Rowling's. However, I have become bored of Voldemort acting like an Idiot or Harry being a super-human-wizard who has been suppressing his powers and what not. Please share any fics that are around this criteria.

A completed Fic would be Appreciated.

Thanks.


** Exile by bennybear - fic about Draco in the muggle world after the war

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6432055/1/Exile]]

Blood Magic by Gateway Girl - AU written before the HBP came out, so some things are different (Snape is a pureblood), but it is really really good.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/719610]]

Harry Potter and the Conspiracy of Blood by cambangst - it is a next gen fic where Harry is a grandparent and he and his friends and family need to fight another dark wizard

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6701647/chapters/15327019]]

Paganaidd's Memories and Dreams series is another fic featuring adult Harry and Ginny with kids. I also really love hir "Digging for the Bones".

[[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Paganaidd/pseuds/Paganaidd/works?fandom_id=136512]]

A one-shot featuring Pansy and the Malfoys that I think is really well-done would be "Heartsease" by Slytherincesss.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7564684/1/Heartsease]]

And finally, Angie Astravic's stories would be something you could check out.

Ditto for Iniga. Hir "Darkness Dying" is my fav Marauder-fic.

** Yes, I hate it as well. I generally consider [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/103340][Northumbrian]] to be on the sane side (start with “Tales of the Battle” and go on; you can return later to the earlier stories). Or I am just reading [[https://www.wattpad.com/story/119685004][Moving On by The_girlwholived]] (yes, it is on Wattpad, but it is not like one of /those/; and yes, [[https://github.com/JimmXinu/FanFicFare][FanFicFare]] supports Wattpad as well).
