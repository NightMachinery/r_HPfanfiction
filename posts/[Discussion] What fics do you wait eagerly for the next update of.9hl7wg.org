There's got to be at least one fic that would make you happy-dance if you saw it update today. Which fic is that for you?

  Magic can solve all the Wizarding World's problems. What's that? A prophecy that insists on a person? Things not quite going your way? I know, lets use this here ritual to summon another! It'll be great! - An eighteen year old Harry is called upon to deal with another dimension's irksome Dark Lord issue. This displeases him. EWE - AU HBP

#+begin_quote
  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding?

  After being spurned by his lover and fired from his job, Charlie Weasley is back in England living with his mother and working at the Department of Mysteries... no, not that Department of Mysteries, the bar, in Knockturn Alley. Unfortunately for Charlie, the publication of a new edition of the Sacred Twenty Eight means he'll find no rest at the Burrow, and he finds himself in the center of a feverish hunt for the Bloodwand, a mysterious artifact allegedly bound to the "purest" wizarding family. This story is marked as part of a series, but it is not necessary to read Percy Weasley's adventure to follow the events of this one.

A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight.

  Daphne Greengrass is on a quest to be the main character of her own life for once, but that's easier said than done. Includes: conspiracy theories, evil plotting, a Slytherin revolution, and sassy Potter. OotP, HBP, and DH. Not your usual Daphne.

The only stories that would make me happy AND I've got hopes for are linkffn(the havoc side of the force) and kathryn518's fics, because they're still well within expected updating patterns of the authors.

** Catechism linkffn(2006636). I'm a masochist.

Sympathetic Properties linkffn(10914042). The author is /way/ too ambitious, and at this point I just wanna see if he'll ever manage to finish it.

The Perils of Innocence linkffn(8429437). Kinda lost faith on this one though.

  AU The Dursleys taught Harry to fear and hate magic and all things magical including himself. Now how long will it take the wizarding world see the damage done? And can they ever hope to fix it? Disturbing. WIP

  Having been treated as a servant his entire life, Harry is more sympathetic when Dobby arrives, avoiding Vernon's wrath and gaining a bit of freedom. That freedom changes his summer, his life, and the world forever. A very long character-driven story that likes to play with canon.

  AU. In an institute to help children with psychological issues, a child is abandoned by his guardians because he does extraordinary things. Rather than fear him, the doctors work to help him try to control this ability. They discover other children with these incredible powers. And then odd letters arrive one summer day. Rating will probably go up later. Eventual H/Hr.

  At the end of 3rd year, Hermione asks Harry for some help with starting an interesting project. If a dark lord's got a 50-year head start on you, maybe what you need is a little more time to even the playing field. AU, Timetravel, HHr, mild Ron bashing. Minimizing new powers, just making good use of existing ones.

** Inkstains

Zigadenus

Summary:

What looks like living is sometimes just survival.

Hermione Granger --- Weasley --- Granger has scars: the ones the war inflicted, and the ones she inflicted. Mostly the ones she inflicted. And Hermione Granger has some wounds that never did heal; here in the smouldering aftermath of her marriage, they're about to start bleeding anew. Written in the conceptual universe of the short story, Lies and Red Ink (generally DH-compliant, EWE?, probably requires a mature reader perspective).

** A Discortant Note by Noodlehammer.

​

It's the continuation of the "For Love of Magic" fanfic and I absolutely adore it. For some reason I just haven't found anything else quite like it in the fanfiction library.
