Started reading fanfics this year and got hooked on HP/Gabrielle pairing HP/Fleur fine also but prefer the sister (I like how the authors try and work around the age difference and the fact that I don't associate a face to Gabrielle unlike fleur). HP/Veela/Others is also fine. There can be plot with smut, smut with some plot or no plot at all.

Stories I've read, and a list for people looking for HP/Veela pairs

- [[https://www.hpfanficarchive.com/stories/viewstory.php?sid=539][Emerald Coven]]
- [[https://www.hpfanficarchive.com/stories/viewstory.php?sid=1061][Incubus]]
- [[https://www.hpfanficarchive.com/stories/viewstory.php?sid=1041][Inheritance]]
- [[https://www.hpfanficarchive.com/stories/viewstory.php?sid=315][The Unexpected Result Of]]
- [[http://www.hpfanficarchive.com/stories/viewstory.php?sid=276][Harry Potter and the Veela Bond]]
- [[https://ficwad.com/story/76962][Harry Potter and the Midnight Sun]]

Also a completed story would be so appreciated, I'm honestly not sure if any I listed is complete but having to read a good story suddenly end is so depressing.

Edit: Added HP and the midnight sun after reading it, thanks to [[/u/wordhammer]] for suggesting it.


** The only three Gabrielle fics I can actually even think of are:

[[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Hope/index/][Hope]] by Jeconais (not on [[https://ff.net][ff.net]]): super Harry sort of fic, but possibly the earliest Gabrielle fic

Vitam Paramus linkffn(Vitam Paramus): quidditch/slice-of-life fic

The Accidental Bond linkffn(The Accidental Bond by kb0): a harem fic, but one of the only fics with a semi-reasonable premise for why this is a thing.

** I haven't read many fics with Gabrielle as a focal point and I'm not sure if any of the ones I am about to link contain the smut you are looking for but I figured something is better than nothing. linkffn(12200475) From the author of the Rune Stone Path, this fic contains time travel and a relationship between Harry, his twin sister, and Gabrielle. linkffn(12251133) This one contains a female Harry with Gabrielle and a time loop/reset. I remember it being surprisingly good.

To make up for the lack of smut in those two, here's a extremely kinky Harry/Hermione/Fleur porn without much plot story linkao3(Accio Ballgag!)

  Fast-forward, ten years later. Mistress Hermione is so proud of her little Harry! She knew this was exactly how things were supposed to happen right from the start. She's sometimes slightly dysfunctional, just a little possessive, but still adorable... although disagreeing with Mistress Hermione is not recommended. She has a little problem, though. “Happily forever after” is more complicated in real life than in books...
