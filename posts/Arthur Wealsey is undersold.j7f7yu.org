Most depictions of Arthur, including the canon one is nice-but-dim. He is described as being unambitious and shunted into a dead end department which gets no respect. He is meant to be working with muggles all the time, but still knows nothing about them. This is especially contrasting to his children, who are a curse breaker, dragon handler, inventors etc.

But if you actually read between the lines this is all wrong. His job description seems to be dealing with cursed artefacts that end up in muggle hands. There must be three parts to this: 1. destroying or neutralising the object (curse breaker); 2. fixing any damage it has done (healer) and 3. clearing up the evidence of magic afterwards (obliviator). Given I think his office only has one other worker in it he must do all of these himself. Realistically he is probably more magically capable than most aurors, and if anything his children are following in his footsteps. Also as he gets called in, deals with the problem and then leaves, he must need to know how to get around the muggle world (and we do know he can drive), but his job does not actually require him to interact with them or do anything without magic, so why should he need to know how a plug works, and he still knows enough to single handedly enchant a car with magic as a hobby.

TL/DR He is a Ministry curse breaker and a badass.


** To be honest I never really thought that he's the one that actually does the curse breaking, obliviating, the healing. In my headcanon he's the one in charge of finding those situations, going to them, finding out where the curses lie, who needs to be obliviated and tracking them down, and finding who needs to be healed and getting them to healers. He's also the one delegating work to curse breakers, obliviators, and healers.

That being said, I think canon and fics do portray to be much dumber than his job requires, and it is a bit ridiculous that he knows so little about muggles while being head of such a (Imo) pretty damn important office.

*** agree with this take. I still am still frustrated with the way Rowling portrayed him. I think he could have been an absolute boss with a few tweaks, but as he is he's one of the only examples of a wholesome just straight up good dude. A good dad who loves his kids and his wife and works real hard at something he's passionate about

he does take bribes though, and falls into cronyism, but in a cesspit like the ministry I don't know how well I'd do as far as that shit goes either

******* He didn't laugh it off. He tried to calm the situation down to undo the twins' joke on Dudley's tongue but as soon as he was home he ripped into them - he only suddenly quit when Molly came in. And he shouldn't have stopped then, be he probably tried to avoid a further escalation in his home, an angry wife and more tension between molly and the twins.

But yeah, he doesn't really think much in GoF.

I find it a shame that he's so easily represented as a clueless joke, because he's the type of man that is sorely lacking in a lot of media, and HP too. He is kind good man who dislikes conflict, machismo and bravado but stands up with all he has to do the right thing when it's needed. I've always thought that he was the healthiest male figure to look up to Harry had in his life. Sirius, Remus, Dumbledore... the're essentially good people, but they've got a major share of problems themselves.

******** yes, totally! I think that he could have been utilised so much better. There is also a tiny fic that actually points out the fact that in their dorm, Ron is actually the only boy with a healthy or present father figure, and teaches them all how to shave. I feel like there was a thousand opportunities missed there to highlight the positives of their friendship for Harry. Ron might not feel special when compared with his brothers but he had so many male role models, and could have made his thing being, you know, the ‘big brother' of the dorm, but there are none of that.

...but I suppose that's another conversation

In fairness, he was trying to de-escalate the situation. And Fred and George had deliberately spilled the sweets just as they were leaving, thereby allowing them to make a clean getaway.

Twins explictly designed that situation so only a shit person would be affected, or at least someone greedy, gluttonous and lacking self-control.

They cast no spells. They weaved no compulsions. They just dropped some of their possesions, and immediately set to retrieving them. To come to any harm, Dudley had to commit a theft - it's like attempting to steal a pretty light on top of the candle and being surprised it burns.

That they knew that he was that type of person changes nothing.

Not to mention much-traveled Floo exits and the crowd of actively practicing witches and wizardsthat fill it on regular basis.

Otherwise, Hogwarts itself would be considered nonmagical.

That means, the "Magic doesn't work around electronics" is inconsistent at best. And even if the Wards are fanon, the DA curse is apparently not, providing a precedent.

​

The point is, WoG is irrelevant when directly contradicted by source material. In case where no single, uncontested by books, solution exists, I believe fans are entitled to come up with their own. This is one such situation.

** I always thought of the Weasleys as very passionate people and that's why they don't care much about money. Arthur cares about Muggle stuff and does his thing, Bill was extremely brilliant (having been Head Boy and having earned twelve OWLs - more than Hermione) and chose a well paying career (because maybe as the oldest son, he felt the need to help the family) but yet adventurous, Charlie quit Quidditch despite being a boy wonder at it for his passion for dragons, Percy was all for politics and rules, Fred and George were jokesters and broke the bank based on this, Ginny was all for sticking out and she became the wife of the BWL as well as a famous Quidditch player and later on a well known reporter. In my opinion it's only Ron (despite being one of the main characters) who doesn't have a particular ambition other than getting out of his brothers' shadow. Sure he sticks for the weaker ones (muggleborns and house elves) but even that is more out of love for Hermione. Sure he is a good friend. Sure he makes it on the chocolate frog cards but that's because he sticks with Harry.

That is not true! It was actually RON who wanted to be an auror first, not Harry - and that is exactly what he became. He later quit, but honestly: How many 15 year old know what they want and stay at this job all their live.

  While returning to his past has been more of a challenge than Harry expected, he has still managed to find time to make sure his young friends are looked after. But Harry is beginning to realise that juggling his past and his future is more difficult than he expected, and controlling the timeline is more complicated than he thought. Sequel to Harry Potter and the Ticket Backwards.

**** What is the purpose of a rubber duck bro? How do airplanes stay in the air? How do you spell electricity?

It's not that Arthur has a silly hobby, it's that he's straight up comically ignorant about a subject he ought to be very knowledgeable about by sheer virtue of his job. Keyword being comical: the poor man is quite simply comic relief in most of his appearances.

Sure he has plenty of redeeming features and he's a great dad, but he's still a joke professionally and interests wise. Hence, half joke.

**** THIS. As Tom Clancy said of his recurring character Ed Foley, the best disguise for a spy is to have him be thought of as 'a worker drone shooter isn't intelligent enough to be a spy'.

For me, the points that made me always wonder if Arthur was following the 'Don Diego'/'Clark Kent' path was the fact that he fits it so well - he's competent enough in an area no one else wants to also put him in charge of it (remember, even a department head of Misuse of Muggle Artifacts is still someone who's frighteningly competent and magically powerful - he's the first line of defense before you call in Aurors or Unspeakables).

I also always thought that he was more aware of the Muggle world than he let on, particularly around his family. Remember, he survived the First Wizarding War (and as a 'blood traitor' who married into the Prewitt family, he was on the list), he KNOWS that Death Eaters and other Dark types are still about & he knows that loose lips abound in the Wizarding world the way that common sense does not. 😉 It would mean bad things if his kids or wife ever slipped up and spoke in the wrong place, so they need to buy into the image, too.

I only wish that, like Molly, Arthur had gotten his moment in the spotlight. After all, his name IS 'Arthur'...

On a totally unrelated note - has anyone else noted that Luna Lovegood, the smartest girl in the series, also has what makes a really good Bond Girl name and persona? (Hermione, to my eyes, isn't the smartest per se - to me, Hermione is a 'technician's while Luna is a 'scientist's, i.e. Luna does things for the point of discovery whereas Hermione does things for the point of implementation of existing materials. Hermione is best when she has a goal, whereas Luna is best when the goal is to look beyond the known. Best example? Hermione would have never thought to ask a centuries-old ghost for information on an ancient relic - she would have instead searched the known repositories of information to create a trail leading to it.)

Arthur, Luna, Alastor Moody and even Harry. It's interesting that the ones who are looked down on by the rank and file are the ones who keep things on the straight and narrow.

** Arthur IS awesome, but not because he's an expert curse breaker - he's an EXPERT POLITICIAN. He‘s Head of a department half the Wizengamot would eliminate if they could. They can't in part because Arthur knows how to schmooze and juggle competing rivals against each other so well they don't even realize he's neutralized them.

Someone should have sat Percy down and told him to pull his head out of his butt and learn from a MASTER.

** I am also tired of all the people saying that his lack of knowledge about the Muggle world is unacceptable, especially since he doesn't know anything about " eckeltricity ".

Part of it is because, just as you said, his job does not ask him to understand "how" Muggle technology work, but to identify which items when jinxed and to deal with the situation. But it's also because, for a Wizard, Electricity is probably the most useless thing ever.

From the point of view of the Wizards, "Electricity" is just something Muggles came up with to live without magic, but they have no reason to care about it. Pretty much anything done by electricity can easily be replaced by a spell (from the Animation Charm to the Lumos). So yeah, Arthur know that electricity is used to make things work, but he doesn't know how since Magic is made it useless. He is in the same situation as someone knowing that cars "need" gas, but who has no idea how gas makes a car run.
