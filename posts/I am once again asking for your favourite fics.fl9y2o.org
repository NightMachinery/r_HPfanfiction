After exhausting Ffnets reserves in the past years I finally moved to ao3 and haven't found a whole lot of good fics. Due to the Corona Virus our Easter Holidays have been lengthened to 5 weeks and I don't have anything left to read.

What are your favourite fics or underrated fics that aren't that well known? If possible no slash, femHarry and I'd prefer Harry as the main character but he doesn't have to be.

Cheers

Edit: Thanks everyone for all the responses! Never imagined I'd get so many. Hopefully most of you found some new fics to read as well!

** This isn't complete but it's such an interesting idea and I generally adore esama's works: linkao3(1358209). My faves in the fandom are The Best Revenge, The Accidental Animagus and On the Way to Greatness but you've probably read all those already.

*** I think I've read 'On the Way to greatness' but I haven't read the others yet. I started the Accidental Animagus but dropped it after the first two chapters a year ago because I wasn't looking for a Harry/Hermione fic. I've seen it recommended so many times now that I'll definitely give it the try it deserves. Thanks

**** I would highly recommend The Best Revenge then! And I see the commenter below already clarified the Harry and Hermione relationship in The Accidental Animagus. Definitely nothing romantic there and in TAA (not the sequel) there is barely any romance at all because they're very young.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** Favorite underrated fic on ao3 hands down for me is linkao3(Into the Fold by pasi) which, imo, has the best characterization of Snape that I've ever seen. I'm also a big fan of linkao3(The King's Indian Attack; Swung by Serafim by flamethrower; Of a Linear Circle - Part I by flamethrower). I'm also going to plug my own series, linkao3(The Chessmaster: Black Pawn).

In terms of fem!Harry, linkffn(Victoria Potter by Taure) is good, but is a more well-known fic so maybe you've already read it.

  Aurora Sinistra spends most of her time watching the stars. She's no centaur, but she's better than Trelawney. In the summer of 1991, she has a plan redeem the reputation of Slytherin House, and maybe some of the people inside it. Recruiting Severus Snape to help her over a game of chess, the two teachers undertake a gambit of their own that leads the Boy-Who-Lived and the Brightest Witch of Her Age into Slytherin House and friendships with Draco Malfoy.However, there is something strange going on at the school. Can the three figure out what it is that Professor Quirrell is up to and stop it? How will the changes in House and friendships effect Harry's relationship with Dumbledore and the headmaster's plans?

I didn't expect to like it based off the description, but read it bc it's by flamethrower on ao3, who's an amazing writer. It's SO well written, has so many amazing plot twists, and keeps you hooked. 20/10, would absolutely recommend. Plus, it'll keep you busy for a long time!!

  A chance meeting and Albus and Gellert would become inseparable friends, until the death of Albus' sister. But what if Ariana had survived? Almost a century later, a boy named Harry Potter would survive the Killing Curse, finally bringing an end to Grindelwald's war. Now, as he finds a place for himself at Hogwarts, there are signs that suggest that the war might not truly be over.

** My favorites off of ao3 might be cross-posted but the 19 years and beyond series by northumbrian and the changeling series by Annerb are some of the best long hauls in fanfic.

linkao3(8231690)

linkao3(189189)

Though the changeling is Ginny-centric (sequels have more Harry) and 19 years and beyond have like a dozen POV characters throughout the 63 stories. In my opinion, the best ones are the oc ones, but a few are Harry-centric.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Char bashing, no Mary Sues.

Also with regards to The Seventh Horcrux; I found the description lacking; the story is a very good comedy read. Ignore the description and try at least 2 chapters before deciding whether or not you like the story.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived.

  “The first group I sent over made the Avengers uncomfortable by thanking them constantly and asking for autographs. The next group stole things to sell on ebay. The group after that didn't even get through the front door because Stark's security system found something in their background that we missed. The fourth group left traumatized after cleaning out Thor's room, apparently the god had some beheaded poultry dripping blood into a bowl in there. Then after that every group I've left hasn't lasted more than three days because of some problem or another. I'm pretty sure one of those assholes has made it a game to scare my workers away.”“I don't think you're supposed to call the heroes of New York assholes.”Or, cleaning up after the Avengers involves more than just getting blood stains out of the carpet and most of them can't take the heat. Thankfully the Savior of the Wizarding has spent the last decade cleaning up after Death Eaters, so she's up to the task. Nothing, not pranks, bird corpses, or unidentified slime will keep her from cleaning up.

  “You understand, Professor,” Harry began, after a moment, “that I don't have my N.E.W.T.s. I never even finished seventh year. Between everything, I never had a chance the first time around, and then afterwards there didn't seem to be much point. Hermione argued for it, of course, but I was so tired of Britain. So technically, I am completely unqualified for the position.” “Quite a way to begin an interview, Mr. Potter,” McGonagall said, dryly.

** Knowledge is Power by Defenestratable. Original Author is Fettucini. Hands down, no argument, best NON-BWL & Older Harry fic out there. Dialogue is great from the beginning. Harry is not too overpowered, more like overly smart (or everyone else is that idiotic). The slow build between Harry and Fleur is fantastic as it seems to be more realistic but also not. Great OC's, these OC's have decent backstory, great personality, and are there not to be overpowered or for exposition.

  It's 1975 and Whoever-He-Is has turned his eyes towards Hogwarts. Muggle-born Lily Evans is certain her best friend has been recruited by the Death Eaters. She's less certain about her future in Wizarding Britain. And she has absolutely no idea how to handle the dark-haired, outrageously privileged, obnoxiously talented toerag named James Potter. A canon-compliant account of the first Wizarding War and the teenagers who fought in it.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

  An avid fanfiction reader falls into the Harry Potter Universe just before the Triwizard Tournament, and has to come to terms with what he's lost, take advantage of what he's gained, and figure out how to deal with the truths he's hiding.

** The Heir of the House of Black by Ravenclawblues on AO3 is one of my favorites.

It takes a largely unique approach to the Master of Death trope where Harry travels into a alternate timeline similar to his. This time it is to prevent the rise of a Dark Lord who was working behind the scenes as the world focused on Voldemort. He is reborn as Sirius and Regulus' older brother.

It's relatively new but has a tentatively large hit count of 55k. It currently has a 277k word count and 37 chapters. The author updates regularly though I don't recall the exact schedule. The story is gen with no romance among the main characters beyond the pre-established cannon ones.

** This might get buried, but my all time favorite series is linkffn(Resonance by GreenGecko).

In case it doesnt link [[https://fanfiction.net/s/1795399/1/Resonance]]

The trilogy is over 1mil words and has a completely original plot. Harry is the main character and it takes a couple chapters until the author hits their stride, but it's well worth it. Great characterizations and world building, gradual power development (different too!). It's truly truly worth the read and it's very well written. We get to see what the Auror training is actually like, and a Harry who doesn't instantly find his one true love on the first date and instead meets and dates people like a normal person (though it's not the focus of the story). Multidimensional OC's and a believable situation that ends up with Snape adopting/mentoring Harry.

This is the only hp fanfic that I reread every year because it stands the test of time and is just that freaking good. Please give it a try and let me know what you think of it!

** 2 long and outlandish ones with Hermione as the main character:

I don't know it you're into this kind of stuff, but "Crazy Little Things" by Dreiser is my favorite fanfic ever. It's a university Hermione/Luna story and it was one of the first HP fanfictions that I've read and they reamined my favorite ship since then. Great chemistry, some interesting and pretty unique Luna depiction, a nice jungle adventure sequence and lots of lovely moments.

The other one I must mention is "Wingardium Leviosa Because it Makes Things Float" by ReverseHipster. It's a Harry Potter and Stephen King's "It" crossover with Hermione/Pennywise. There's a bunch of explicit stuff and gore in it and some really morally questionable character decisions, but the atmosphere and overall weirdness of the better kind was an absolute win for me. It's really not something you read every day.

Their best isn't perfect. ~“Are you trying to get killed, Potter?” Malfoy drawls, stalking forward. Quick as a serpent himself, he reaches out and grabs the snake just below the head. It thrashes in his grip, but is no longer able to bite anyone. “This is a poisonous snake, and I doubt anyone brought a bezoar with them.” Harry glares. He opens his mouth, and feels the beginning the snake's language pass his lips, and this isn't what he wants, what's the point of insulting Malfoy if he can't understand him -- Malfoy's eyes widen. He slaps his hand over Harry's mouth, “Potter, what the hell--”~(Now with a TV Tropes page!)
