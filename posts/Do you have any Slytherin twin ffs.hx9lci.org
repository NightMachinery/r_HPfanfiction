I mean that the Weasley twins got sorted into Slytherin. Didn't remember about the Carrow twins


** Are you looking for fics that have more prominent roles for the carrow twins (flora & hestia) or are you looking for Fred and George Weasley in Slytherin?

** If it's the Carrow twins (daughters) you could try The Betrothal Situation: Betrothed by GryffindorTom

Edit: I searched through the stories I've read and while a have a handful with either Ron or Ginny or both in Slytherin it seems I haven't read a single story with the Weasley twins in Slytherin.

  A visit to Gringotts Bank to claim his inheritance after the death of Sirius Black provided a really big shock to Harry Potter when he found out he was betrothed to his secret girlfriend, Susan Bones , plus the twin daughters of Alecto Carrow. Disregards HBP & DH.
