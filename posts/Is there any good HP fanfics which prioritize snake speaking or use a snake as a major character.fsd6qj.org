I'm looking for fan fictions that remember that Harry can talk to snakes and include a snake as an important relationship for him? Or any story where his ability to talk to snakes is an important aspect of his life?

Thank you!!

Parsel is relatively fun. Harry is raised by Snakes and it actually has some noticeable effects on his development.

** linkao3(Perfectly Normal) is a pretty loooong series prominently featuring Harry and his pet Snake that he gets in, I think either part 2 or 3 of the series.

  This fic doesn't contain new information, it's a meta work providing brief summaries of fics in the "Perfectly Normal" series. Each chapter summarises one of the fics as an aid to refresh your memory if it's been a while since you read the series, but you want to pick up where you left off. Warning -- major spoilers ahead!

** A very slytherin harry series and a brother to basilisks has this. (These are both slash.)

Also children of the sun series, I haven't finished it yet but it does feature a snake somewhat similar in style to his dark materials (as in soul animals.)

Perfectly Normal (which was also recced is good too.)

There are a ton of these, and I'm sure there are more I'm forgetting about. Searching through AO3 woth relevant tags would work, such as familiars or snakes/parseltounge or slytherin harry etc. I usually sort by word count, kudos, or favorites.

EDIT: Antithesis!! That one is also heartbreakingly amazing. It's pretty dark, but so very good.
