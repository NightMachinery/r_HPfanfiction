** Some not included in the previous request:

Linkffn(Prince if a Dark Kingdom).\\
Very good Voldemort won story.

I hesitated to mention my own on the last thread because it mentioned an adult Harry , but my linkff(The Firebirds Son) And it's sequels are dystopian fics. Though it does have a very hopeful ending.

*** I'm reading Prince of the dark kingdom right now and it's nice, but my god it's full of spelling mistakes, words missing and whatever. It's infuriating. Like Diagon alley written Daigon alley, Durmstrang written Durmstang. Etc... It seems like the author never did a re read. It would really benefit an update.
