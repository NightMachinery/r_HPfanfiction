** Honestly, if we go the "the statute was removed" route, I think the following would happen

1) Half the muggles don't believe them

2) Every currently self-identifying witch such as Wiccans would either have their worldview shattered, or believe they practice a "different kind" of witchcraft.

3)Fetish art on DeviantArt and other sites

4) Everyone wants a magical pet, now

5) Everyone finds out about Azkaban. Hell breaks loose, as the prison violated several human rights. The Ministry of Magic is under intense scrutiny.

6) "YOU'VE BEEN KEEPING ELVES AS SLAVE?!" more scrutiny.

7) "Why do the wizards have a separate Government with seperated laws, anyway?" Magical Governments start crumbling

8)Magical military forces are established

9) Several jobs are replaced by magic. Tensions are rising.
