A request from my friend who is too lazy to use VPN lol.

Anyone knows any interesting fanfictions with Hogwarts Founders? whether it's time travel (Harry go back in time or the founders go to canon era), talking potraits of the founders, or founders reincarnated as canon characters, all is okay. She said the only one she ever found was Strange Visitors From Another Country by Izzyaro


** Here's some of my favorites.

Hermione Granger and the Serpent's Renaissance - Salazar Slytherin is reincarnated as Hermione Granger. Great premise, great writing. It's ongoing but updated fairly regularly and is already the length of several novels covering each year at school.

Of a Linear Circle - I love this series. It's a bit of a slow build and massive but absolutely worth it. It involves time travel with some of the stories set in the canon era and others in the founders era, with the best founders era worldbuilding I've seen.

Why to Sort a Student is a Horrible Job - Reincarnation, very funny.

Basilisk-born - Time travel, Harry is Salazar. The author isn't a native English speaker so the writing can be a little iffy in places but the story is fantastic.

  The Sorting Hat needs a vacation after it was forced to sort a special student. Sadly, Albus isn't happy with the idea. Luckily, there're always old... friends (?) who are willing to help out. If the Hat had known, it would have stayed home... AU Reincarnation-fic.

  Fifth year: After the Dementor attack, Harry is not returning to Hogwarts -- is he? ! Instead of Harry, a snake moves into the lions' den. People won't know what hit them when Dumbledore's chess pawn Harry is lost in time... Manipulative Dumbledore, 'Slytherin!Harry', Time Travel!
