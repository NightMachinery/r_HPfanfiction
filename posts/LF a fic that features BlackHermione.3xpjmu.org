*** There's a few things that hint at it: we know that she can visibly flush, that the color drains from her face when afraid, and that she tans quite noticeably without extreme sun exposure (as in, after a normal holiday). All of this points to her not being super dark, because then flushing wouldn't be noticeable, but she's not super pale either, because she tans easily. The purely white British side of my family doesn't tan at all, so I'm assuming that she's at least got a bit of ancestry from somewhere where people do tan. Edit: Apparently enough British people tan well that she could be purely British. Probably still darker than Emma Watson though.

Rowling has stated that Hermione's race is not essential to her character though, so it's pretty explicitly up to interpretation.

**** I think that's stretching it a bit tbh. This is right after holidays which she took in France. Her is the quote

"They were there, both of them, sitting outside Florean Fortescue's Ice-Cream Parlour, Ron looking incredibly freckly, Hermione very brown, both waving frantically at him."

Granted it is used in the same breath as Ron's freckles, but in context it seems clear that he is just remarking on his friends faces who he hasn't seen. The most standout of which is Rons ginger freckles and Hermiones (new) tan. Also I would argue the the use of 'very' is telling- I would consider it untypical to even internally think of someone as "very" brown who you've known as a friend for two years. If it was a familiar it would just be "brown". Again IMO the descriptor of 'incredibly' freckly is natural, thinking of someone who really is dark skinned as "very brown" in the way used there just seems so out of place. Also as [[/u/Makinporing]] stated later in PoA there is this quote "Hermione's white face was sticking out from behind a tree." As well as the picture JK drew herself. As well as book cover, as well as it never ever coming out in interviews like 'actually Dumbledore is gay" - "you know it's strange Hermione in my mind's eye is pictured as being brownorblack"- particularly with the movies and casting (and Emma will never be Hermione to me- so I'm not tied to that). Anyway all that is conclusive IMO, plus honestly 99% of people would have said so anyways.

Finally I read a essay on hplexicon [[http://www.hp-lexicon.org/essays/essay-secrets-of-the-classlist.html][quick look says this one]] which basically shows how very specific Rowling is. For the 90s when she was writing she has a very accurate picture of Britain represented in Hogwarts. You have North and South, differing regions and cities, Wales, Scotland, Ireland, Rich, Poor, upper class muggleborns, lowerclass, you have Indian, Jew, Black, mixed-race, Asian, etc. even further details into surnames which indicate the type of British people groups they may have descended from iirc. Basically at the end of the day Rowling makes clear who is what, even if that takes a while with Blaise, it would have been made clear were Hermione Black or mixed-race. Given her prominence that would be sooner rather than later but it would have happened. Again probably right at the start with the other descriptors like the Weasleys "flaming red hair".

IMO the bookish Hermione with two dentists for parents I guarantee you, as was shown in her own sketch and writing, was written and intended to be white. I wouldn't have thought this was even arguable but given the recent play- white Hermione is canon. They can cast whoever and I don't care (at least for a play- though tbh if they did like an awesome Avatar style anime/cartoon and Hermione was Black it would probably throw me off), but to assert Canon never specifies/it is up for interpretation is pushing the boundary of believability IMO.

***** Wales is given short shrift in HP canon. There are only a few mentions, mostly in PA while Harry is on the Knight Bus. Another occurs in an expanded-universe Daily Prophet blurb where the Welsh National Gobstones team writes to complain about the lack of representation in the Prophet's sport section.

It's not surprising, though. I'd never figured that the Isle of Man, Cornwall, or Wales would play a significant part in the story despite the fact that she borrowed heavily from native legends in creating her world. Her treatment of the Irish in GoF is stereotypical, though.

****** This. People also like to forget the likelihood that Helga Hufflepuff could originate from the Welsh valleys 'sweet Hufflepuff from valley broad'. Then again the surname, since there are a few like Cadwaldr etc. She could have gone crazy with the Celtic influence, like using Brythonic and/or Godelic or even Gaulish words for spells, which would have seemed, IMO, more accurate for the location (even Saxon words ffs) but noooo has to be Latin because it seems more 'upper class'.

#+end_quote

Excellent points. In a Maen yr Athronydd (the Welsh translation), Hufflepuff is Wfftitwff. Welsh surnames are quite often either place names or patronymic and almost all are cognates. Hufflepuff is neither of those and there's a lot more to Wales than the Valleys, but I get what you're saying. To a foreigner like Rowling, it would probably be the the most notable feature of Wales.

The use of Latin is really perplexing to me. On one hand, JKR is Scotch English so I wasn't really surprised at her use of what she thinks is an 'old' language. On the other hand... the Romans were long gone before the +Angles, Saxons, and Normans+ English got here. Latin probably didn't exist before 450 BCE while Proto-Celtic (named by ignorant English linguists in the 17th/18th centuries) was certainly established at least eight hundred years prior (although several estimates have even placed it as old as the fifth millenium BCE, though I have my doubts).

I've long been an advocate for the use of one of the indigenous languages to be used. I think it would have been appropriate given how much of her story is derived from native legends. In the end, though, I'm sure she did it because she knew a bit of Latin and couldn't be arsed to learn any of the languages of the other nations of Britain.

There is also political influences in regards to this that no one BUT Welsh, Scottish and Irish would really understand which honestly is rather sad.

Brythonic, Gaulish and Godelic celtic (maybe even early Welsh?) is older than latin as far as I'm aware. Not older than languages like Basque but still.

It's enormously complicated. Here's a crappy timeline:

Proto-Celtic: ??? --> 5th century CE

Common-Brittonic: 5th century CE --> 8th century CE

Old Welsh: 8th century CE --> 12th century CE

Middle Welsh: 12th century CE --> 15th century CE

Welsh: 15th century CE --> present

So it's fair to say that a distant progenitor of Welsh is older than Latin, but not to say that Welsh itself is older than Latin. Given how similar the different branches of this language family are to one another, it's probably not too much of a stretch to say that if you speak Welsh (at least the Northern), then you'd probably be able to comprehend most of the progenitor languages up until Common Brittonic.

#+end_quote

Geoffrey of Monmouth wasn't really 'Welsh.' He barely spoke the Old Welsh of his day, preferring Latin instead. /His/ Merlin is actually a significantly embellished retelling of the tale of Myrddin Wyllt, who was a man living in Wales around 540 CE. [Incidentally, Myrddin Wyllt's story is almost certainly as false as Geoffrey's Merlin.] Geoffrey took this earlier beloved character and inserted him into a tale of kings and knights because that's what was occurring in the present day. It is far more likely that he was himself the descendant of Normans and shouldn't be regarded as contributing anything to Welsh culture. That's an honour I'd reserve for the authors of the Mabinogi and other Welsh stories that likely originated before the Saes came.

***** I actually find it ridiculous that the "very brown" line is touted as proof that Hermione is dark-skinned, without realising how terrible that line would sound if she was black, or Asian, or from any other kind of dark-skinned background:

To call a white person who tanned over the summer "very brown" can be looked at as dry humour, but doing so to a black person (or any dark-skinned race in between) becomes insensitive, because you'd never go up to an Indian bloke and tell him: "Oi, lad, you're looking quite brown today". As a brown-skinned person, I think I would be well justified to punch you in the throat if you said that to me. It's a tactless and stupid thing to say, so how would it be any better in prose? Saying Hermione is non-white and using that line immediately turns the meaning from whimsical to casually racist.

I honestly don't think there's any real debate that JKR originally conceived Hermione to be light-skinned, but has become enamored with the idea of a more diverse Hermione after people pointed the possibility out to her. Which is absolutely her prerogative, JKR is the author, and is entitled to think whatever she wants and cast whoever she wants for the part (and, tbf, Noma Dumezweni is a fantastic actress). I also agree with JKR that Hermione's race doesn't matter to her character, so it shouldn't be as big a deal as it is. But the retroactive painting of Hermione to be this cultural blank slate everywoman strikes me, at best, to be an honest mistake regarding her own material, and at worst, a cloying attempt to "get with the times". It would have been better for JKR to own it and say "In this adaptation, Hermione is black", rather than trying to fall back on canon, which doesn't support her argument.

Well, here's the thing: in my experience, we dark-skinned people don't tan easily. If you commented on me tanning, I would be more surprised that you noticed than anything, since I myself don't notice when I tan.

But there's a difference between "comment[ing] on that" and the "very brown" line. One is literally commenting on it in a neutral manner (i.e. "you're looking tan"), and one is saying something that can easily be misconstrued as hostile/demeaning (i.e. "Hey brown/black person, have you noticed you're looking very brown today?").

If you were a really good friend, and you came up and said I was looking very brown, I'd probably laugh, because it's an absolutely ridiculous thing to say that would probably be offensive in any other situation. Regardless, I would laugh /because/ it's such a casually racist line, not because it's the truth of the matter.

But if I didn't know you, or was only an acquaintance, and you came up and said that to me, I'd think you were a cunt. Full stop. And I don't think I would unjustified in thinking so.

*** I could write one for you if you'd like. Like I asked before, it depends on if you want a fic where she just happens to be Black or you want one where her Blackness is addressed (like maybe she's a first-gen immigrant and that's why she's so driven, or during the holidays she's on edge because of the spate of racial killings in '90s Britain, or maybe even an older Hermione moving to the US to deal with a racist wizarding group, or...)

Though, it would probably take a while. I never post stories that are incomplete.

**** Nah, thanks for the offer but don't go out of your way to deliver. If push comes to shove, I can simply incorporate one in my own fics, which wouldn't be too difficult.
