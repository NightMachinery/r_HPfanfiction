Hey, I just wanted to ask what happened to LeadVonE's story. At the beginning of book 3 he had an outline for updates but then it just stopped. Does anyone know what's happening?


** This is the latest schedule update (early September) he sent to his mailing list - there's also a progress bar for the next chapter on his website:

DP&SW Schedule update

TL;DR --- At least the next five chapters of DP&SW will be published on a 'when they are ready' basis, and the next season of DP&SW (season four), which covers the second half of year two, will start immediately after the end of this season (season three) with no official break in-between.

Hi [redacted],

LeadVonE here. Quick update on what's going on.

In the last few weeks, one of my other projects has really started to demand a level of attention that's just been impossible to ignore. I hesitate to call it 'real life interference' because writing is my life, but at the same time, mouths do need to be fed, and fan-fiction, ultimately, isn't the writing that feeds me.

When I realised I was going to have difficulties following through on all my commitments, I had a decision to make... do I put the current season of Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches on hold, or do I continue to work on it but at a slightly more relaxed pace? Both choices had upsides and downsides.

In the end, I'm choosing to continue working on it. I just don't feel comfortable doing anything else. The plots and characters boil in my head. I will, however, be sure to shoot you an email a few days before a new chapter is going to be released. The next one shouldn't be too far away. I already have a detailed outline finished --- I just need to put together the prose.

You'll probably also be hearing more from me about my other projects as new chapters of DP&SW come out, so if you're following them, that's a plus.

As always, thank you for your patience and continued support, and look forward to the next chapter!

- LeadVone (James)
