I'd like fics where Harry is either on his way to becoming OP, or he is OP but it took him actual time and effort to get to that point. An example of the former is linkffn(13388022) . Linkffn(13540876) is also a pretty great read that fits in the middle-Harry is pretty OP already but he worked hard to get there, and he has a lot more potential so he isn't really near his max power.


** Very cool. First time anyone besides me has recommended my story on this sub.

Thanks :D I saved your post for posterity 🥳

  After defeating the basilisk, Harry is expelled for his efforts. Dumbledore was unable to get his job back as Headmaster. The two set off on a trip together around the world, where Harry will discover the benefits of being the only student of a brilliant former Headmaster who no longer feels the need to avoid sharing information.

  A Death Eater finds Harry two years before he leaves for Hogwarts, and that assassination attempt sets Harry on a course that will shake the Wizarding World to its foundations. Pulled in two directions by opposing sides, Harry must decide which path to walk. Super!Harry (eventually), pairing still undecided.
