Hey guys !!

I have been looking for a story where Harry (post Hogwarts) is thrown back in time or in an alternate universe. What I remember, is about another dark lord, being locked in a book, which tries to escape and come back to life (I thing through Hermione, but not sure)...

Does anybody know/remember this story ?????

  After decades of an empty life and wars that claimed all he ever held dear, the greatest dark lord in living memory and his most loyal servant are finally ready to challenge fate and once again bring down their vengeance upon their enemies. AU, extended universe, Time-Travel, bashing and HAPHNE.
