** Try Reboot by Kallanit

It's loosely based on Reptilia28's challenge where harry, hermione, and snape are all sent back in time.

#+begin_quote
  Very loosely based on the Reptilia28 Don't Fear the Reaper Death Challenge, whereby Harry gets to relive his life. As do a couple of other people. What effect does this have on Harry's life and the Voldemort Blood wars? Not a Discworld crossover, but the story did cry out for some guest appearances by Death's granddaughter. Pre Cursed Child & Fantastic Beasts. COMPLETE.

** Look for Severitus / Sevitus fics.

Severitus = Snape is Harry's biological father

Sevitus = Snape adopts Harry, but searching for Severitus tends to bring up adoption fics as well.

My favourite Severitus fics are Blood Magic by Gateway Girl and Digging for the Bones by Paganaidd.
