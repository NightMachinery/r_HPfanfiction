I'm reviving the wiki project! So here's how it's going to go:

I'm going to comment below some ships (such as Hermione / Ron) and then you comment off of my comment your favorite/best fic for that ship. Please use the bot (see usage guide in sidebar) and say why you think its the best. Please only comment recommendations under the top-level comment provided (or else I won't be able to link to it).

Now, if you aren't suggesting fics, please upvote the recommendations that you have read and think are good. Please don't downvote because you don't like the pairing; someone does, so don't judge.

If you don't see a pairing, then submit a top-level comment of that pairing.

Thanks for contributing to the wiki!

  In a world where Voldemort never existed, Bellatrix Black is a cynical and dour detective working for the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, subdivision Magical Homicides. When she is tasked to solve a murder at Hogwarts, a certain resident genius called Hermione Granger happens to be her prime suspect. AU, Bellamione, liberal amounts of fluff.

Slow and painful at the start, like any good Bellamione should be and progresses well for now.

I LOVE how grangerous filled so much of what Hermione and Severus were doing for the war effort while Harry was busy being moody and lovesick (can you tell I'm a bit biased?). So much of it has become my headcanon. I'm a little iffier on how she dealt with Sympathetic magic in the last one, and I always feel magical creature animagi go a bit too far, but she does it well enough and the rest of the story is so good that I'm willing to give her a pass on both counts.

*** linkffn(Post Tenebras Lux) Severus' characterization is on point. If you're looking for a pure romance and you don't need much action, this is your fic

linkffn(Sin & Vice) most realistic use of a time turner I've seen. If Dumbledore had a time turner that could send a person back a maximum of about seven years at a time, he'd use it to train someone to be exactly what they need to win the war.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4763572/1/Phoenix-Song-or-Hermione-Granger-and-the-HB-P][4763572]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5129305/1/Phoenix-Tears-or-Hermione-Granger-and-the-DH][5129305]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7600629/1/Phoenix-Fire-or-Hermione-Granger-and-the-EW][7600629]]) Phoenix trilogy, canon compliant except for the epilogue. Best mentor!Snape turned romantic interest I've ever read. Hermione actually contributes to the war effort behind the scenes through books six and seven. I've adopted quite a lot of the plot points as my headcanon.

Edit: The bot didn't work for the Phoenix trilogy, so I just made the ID numbers links

*** I enjoyed this one because it takes a while to figure out what exactly is going on, and I love the concept of the Dowry boxes. It's a part of a series of "books", the second of which is WIP, appears abandoned. Marriage law. linkffn(3553046).

I can't find this on FF.N, but Like the Muggles Do is pretty hilarious fic that I think shows how Hermione and Snape could come to work together. [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=9540&i=1]]

This one is a Hermione/Snape, Harry/Draco fic, I think it showed up in the Harry wiki list. Basically it's SuperInteresting!Hermione and Harry who are special virgins and consequently get awesome powers because of it. Linkffn(4776976)

linkffn(2267793) I like how complicated this fic is, particularly the subplot with Draco. Not all choices are easy or right.

#+begin_quote
  ((originally posted elsewhere as "Bride of the Potions Professor")) Sometimes all it takes to change the world is one small, simple choice. On the night the Death Eaters attack Hogwarts, Hermione Granger makes such a choice. Her life---and her world---will never be the same.The guilt from killing Draco is bad enough, and knowing she saved Dumbledore doesn't help it, but when a Ministry decree forces her to marry Professor Snape---a cruel, cold man who's apparently hated her since she was a child---in order to be used as a breeder of superior wizards, Hermione doesn't think her life can get any worse. But, of course, she's wrong.Soon, Voldemort's after her and her friends (again), her life is in grave peril, and all her hopes for a future at all, much less a happy one, rest on her own shoulders---and on Snape, her unwanted husband, whose heart still belongs to a woman long dead.

*** linkffn(Phoenix Song by grangerous)

From [[/u/ligirl][u/ligirl]]:

#+begin_quote
  I LOVE how grangerous filled so much of what Hermione and Severus were doing for the war effort while Harry was busy being moody and lovesick (can you tell I'm a bit biased?). So much of it has become my headcanon. I'm a little iffier on how she dealt with Sympathetic magic in the last one, and I always feel magical creature animagi go a bit too far, but she does it well enough and the rest of the story is so good that I'm willing to give her a pass on both counts.

  Fleur is not an expert in the ways of love, but in Hermione's final year with time running out, the learning curve is steep. Written, with permission, as a companion piece to Dreiser's "No Defense for You" in Fleur's POV. Please note: a slightly more updated version (less typos) lives on AO3. Any chance of a sequel will be posted there as well.

*** Not a huge fan of this pairing, but linkffn(Rebuilding) must be mentioned if only because of the number of reviews, and Colubrina being amazing. It starts out pretty much purely Hermione/Draco but ends up following a lot of Harry and Hermione's year for the two years following the war. Theo's arc is especially well done in my opinion. It's not completed yet, but it updates almost every day and Colubrina is pretty good about finishing her fics.

Edit: I completely missed linkffn(Green Girl by Colubrina) which is probably my favorite Slytherin AU ever. Hermione is sorted into Slytherin and they accept her right away, deciding that house trumps blood. Hermione supports Draco through all his feuds with Harry and Ron and we get to see the Slytherin side to the initiation of the taunts, which actually manages to not make the Slytherins seem evil, while still keeping it similar to what we see in canon. Hermione's relationship to Snape as a mentor/father figure is absolutely perfect, there's a scene in sixth year between them that I have reread countless times. Hermione doesn't let anyone get away with harming Draco for very long, and this fic features the most Slytherin way of taking down Voldemort that I have ever read.

  Becoming attached had never been part of the plan. Neither was falling in love. One night out on the town, Hermione comes face to face with Draco Malfoy--Memory Charmed and living as a Muggle--and an opportunity too good to pass up. What starts as revenge quickly grows into something more, and as Hermione delves deeper into the mysteries surrounding the man who can't remember who he is - the man everyone thought was dead - she might discover more than she can handle.

  Post-DH, Hermione confronts the post-war world, including the wizarding War Crimes Trials of 1999, rogue Dementors, werewolf packs, and Ministry intrigue. All is not well, and this is nothing new. Rated M for later chapters.

*** linkffn(Tied for Last)

Has exactly the sort of messed up relationship you would expect with this pairing, but the author acknowledges that and it doesn't feel as if it's being presented as healthy. Additionally, it deals with the time travel issue in definitely one of the better ways I've seen. It gets weird toward the end, but I think it sticks the landing. The majority of the fic is beautifully written, with characters that really come to life.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - and Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

*** linkffn(Stop All the Clocks by theelderwand1) and its sequel linkffn(Children's Cusade by theelderwand1). Takes place after Harry is killed in the forest by Bellatrix Lestrange. I have some problems with the former, but Children's Crusade is very, very good.

linkffn(What if the Boy Hadn't Lived?). Same premise as the above, but with different execution.

linkffn(Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live by OtterAndTerrier) has some brilliant fucked-up-ness.

linkffn(Apple Crumble, Apple Cart) has some great writing and good drama, though I felt that Hermione's bitchiness is this fic was overdone.

linkffn(After the End) is a classic that can fit under either the Harry/Ginny or the Ron/Hermione category as both pairings are equally important. This fic has some of the best writing I've ever read.

*** linkffn(6662663) is a lovely take on DH + the beginnings of the epilogue - while the dialogue is awkward at times, early on, the author seems to have found their groove rather quickly, and it's the first R/Hr and first HP fanfiction I read, so I'll always cherish that.

linkffn(7671626) is another AU take on DH - while the canon deviates rather significantly at some points, it's nothing super insane, and in that, this story finds its greatest footing.

linkffn(10948460) is a Shell Cottage/post-Manor outtake, and these kinds of stories are some of my absolute favorites. This one in particular is nice because it's not too rushed, just a conversation that hints at something greater.

#+begin_quote
  Ron and Hermione talk about their feelings at Shell Cottage and realize they may never get a chance to be together. Based off my personal headcanon of what happened and is entirely in sync with the scene from the Deathly Hallows book. Rated T for angst.

*** I wasn't sure if I should add this story here - the story is still in progress, and while there are hints to R/Hr, the author hasn't decided yet which way the story is going to go, romance-wise. Should I have waited for Best of Ron?

I like Slytherin!Ron. He's not portrayed as a jerk who likes to pick on muggleborns and halfbloods. I like how he interacts with his siblings. And throwing in the seer!ability adds something new to the mix. The writing is also pretty good - it's not stilted.

Fairly long, with a pretty slow build that makes the pairing very believable. There's time travel in this, and it's handled in a way I haven't really seen before and though was really cool. The characters are pretty interesting. It's decently well written, and definitely enjoyable to read.

  Curiosity killed the cat, they say. But satisfaction brought it back. A few years after the war Hermione is a widely respected academic about to start her latest research project. To see its completion, however, she will truly have to venture into the unknown. Cissy/Hermione pairing in due time. Might turn M in later chapters.
