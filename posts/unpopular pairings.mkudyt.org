What are some of y'alls favorite pairings that don't seem to be too popular? For example I love seeing Harry/Charlie or Harry/George/ Fred. I can't seem to find nearly as many as others.


** Harry/Cedric and Harry/Krum

I haven't ever seen a quality fic for the second pair...

** To be fair I'm not sure how popular they actually are but I guess looking at ao3 Fleur/Hermione is /very/ popular. Wow.

Anyway, I like Charlie/Tonks.

And I just looked at Harry/Charlie on ao3 because you made me curious and it seems to have blown up in 2021.

** 1) Harry/Millicent (Bulstrode). Aka the least popular Harry/Slytherin Girl ship. Idk I don't really have "reason" for shipping them other than I think they'd be neat. Lol.

2) Cedrella/Septimus, Arthur's mum and dad. I went through a phase where Cedrella was my favorite character so yeah lol.

3) Basically any of the femslash ships I ship other than linny and pansmione (which aren't anywhere near the top of my list, rip).

*** I /hate/ True Form Tonks. Mostly cause it doesn't make sense to me-Teddy was changing from birth, judging by the baby picture Lupin showed, so how would you even know the default state?

But also because they're never creative with it. Her True Form is always either a bombshell or a mousy, plain girl. At least pull a Mystique or something if you're going to give her a default.

***** Knowing Tonks's pre-book-six personality, she'd probably embrace the roleplay of Metamorphosing into whatever she or her partner felt like. She'd still set boundaries, of course, but I doubt that Tonks would get heartbroken and annoyed over being seen for her congenital gift.

I mean, one of the first things she did in canon was to casually ask Harry whether or not her then-current hair colour suited her. She just seemed so chill over the whole Metamorphmagus thing.

** I've got a couple!

Firstly, Harry/Pansy. It's not /uncommon/ in the usual sense, but the majority of it is either PWP, or in the background of a Draco/Hermione fic because the author felt compelled to include Pansy in some non-bashing way. Fics where Harry/Pansy are the focus and are romantic are rather rare.

Secondly Fleur/Tonks. Fleur's a well put together, somewhat aloof, somewhat prideful preppy girl, and Tonks is a cheerful, goofy punk. That is, almost universally, my jam. 'tis a great ship dynamic.

Okay, now for the really unpopular one: Voldemort/Harry, preferably Tom/Harry. I'm just a sucker for soulmate/soul connection fics and they're the obvious pick for it. The thing is, I absolutely hate any fics with dubious consent or any kind of power dynamics that make the relationship unequal.

**** Yeah, I think it's a pretty unpopular opinion in this sub though. “Controversial” may be more the word, which is fair enough because I've read a fair amount of creepy HP/V fics and there's definitely some aspects of it that's controversial for a reason lol.

  COMPLETE. As the unintended Captain of the most despised Auror squad, can Draco Malfoy lead his band of Slytherins through Death Eater attacks and threats from the Ministry? Definitely not. At least, not without the help of his reluctant Lieutenant: Ginny Weasley. Inconveniently, the last person he'd ever ask.

** I have this thing for Harry/Minerva. And here's the kicker: no time travel of any kind or de ageing. I prefer if Harry's around twenty, and that mages live for a very long time, so that Min won't look too old.

That said, even though I've always loved Maggie Smith as McGonagall, I always felt she was a bit... old to play her. Am I the only one?

*** You're not the only one - I think they made all the adult characters too old, tbh. Even Dumbledore, I think they should have cast somebody younger and used makeup to age him up a bit.

I always pictured McGonagall as Kate Duchêne (I.e. Miss Hardbroom from the Worst Witch), but just slightly older.

Wizards and witches are supposed to have much linger life spans than muggles, so it makes sense for their ageing to be delayed, and for older magical folk to look younger than a muggle of the same age would look.

** Draco/ Ron. I feel they would be the slash equivalent for those who already like Draco/Hermione. Both have a prior history together, so there's no need to add in unnecessary drama in to the mix, they're also both smart, stubborn to the point you want to smack them upside the end and have a knack for getting themselves out of trouble.

I feel the two of them, if they set aside their differences and blood status, would actually surprisingly get along. Of course it would take a very long time too, but its something worth seeing.
