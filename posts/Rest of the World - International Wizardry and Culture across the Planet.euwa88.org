So, I've gotten to thinking recently about how Magic and Magical Cultures/Species would be across the world, and my intense hope for more international magical world fanfiction.

So to help people write more of that, I wanted to try get a big pool of information, like we did with the Briticisms thread a week or so ago. Since there's no quick and snappy way to ask for information on a wide variety of cultures, I'll be listing some suggestions for what might count as useful or interesting information.

- What are some interesting cultural, linguistic, and historical facts you know about countries around the world?
- Myths, Legends, and Folk Stories from various countries?
- Creature-myths and cryptids from outside Britain?
- For the non-Brits, how do you think magic would be where you live? What ideas of magic does your culture have?
- What parts of your society do you think a secret magical underbelly would mimic? What might be different?
- What kind of focus (magic tool) do you think a culture might use?
- Any Brits who've travelled, what've you seen in other countries, what cultural things did you experience, etc?
- Headcanons of the magical world as a whole: international governance, diplomatic relationships, wars and cooperation
- Snippets of ideas that might be cool - do Swedish Wizards ride into battle on Valkyrie Horses? Do Indian Wizards ride into battle on Basilisk-Skin Armoured Elephants? Do Latvian Wizards walk into battle because they don't believe in Animal Cruelty?
- Really, whatever you've got. If you've got questions, ask. Someone might be able to answer them for you.

Let's help each other write international fics with sensitive, accurate portrayals of other cultures. I know most of us are probably British or American, but I'm pretty sure we've got a few international redditing Potterheads here and I think we could get some interesting worldbuilding going. And hell, if you're British or American and know stuff about other cultures, chip in too. As the most versatile advertising slogan ever says, Every Little Helps.


** So I have some assorted thoughts on magical Scandinavia:

- We see very little of Ancient Runes in the books. One thing we do learn is that Hermione messes up /ehwaz/ and /eihwaz/, both of which are symbols from the Elder Futhark. Ancient Runes is deemed relevant enough to be taught at Hogwarts instead of another language like e.g. Latin. As such, I would like to assume that a significant body of magical literature exists written in runes. The choice of the Elder Futhark (associated mainly with Proto-Germanic inscriptions on 4th-8th century artifacts) over the much more well-known Younger Futhark (the one associated with vikings) is really interesting. Assuming that this is deliberate, we must account for ~4th-8th century tribes producing "literature" (inscriptions on wood, most likely, or stretching the differences between magical and nonmagical society perhaps ink on vellum) relevant enough to 20th century wizards that their texts are chosen over Roman or Greek sources /and/ over viking-era sources. The absolute majority of Proto-Germanic runic findings OTL are from [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendel_Period][Vendel-period]] Sweden, so it seems fair to conclude that that time constituted a magical Scandinavian golden age. The Viking era would then represent the twilight of this age, with ancient family magics being dispersed across Europe as Viking settlers arrived in places like Normandy, Sicily, Britain, and so on.
- OTL Icelandic nobles attempted to keep elements of Norse culture alive which they saw die out in the rest of Scandinavia: Scaldic poetry, the Lawthing, and to an extent Norse mythology. With a stronger sense of "national" pride owing to our assumed importance of Iron-age Scandinavia, a likely much greater hostility to the church, and a reduced necessity for trade thanks to magic, I would expect Magical Iceland to be an insular society keeping to old ways and scoffing at the "fall" of the rest of Scandinavia -- Japan might not be a terrible analogy. If there is magical oceanborn trade, I would expect Iceland to be a hub for North-sea piracy. The form of government would /definitely/ be pseudo-democracy under a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thing_(assembly)][Lawthing]].
- The rest of Scandinavia will have followed a very different path. If we assume that the pagan traditions of Scandinavia are a representation of how magic was performed in my theoretical Vendel-period golden age, Christianity would have come down /hard/ against Scandinavian magicals. Lots of persecution in the 10th-12th century, church authorities destroying every magical text they come across, witch trials, that kind of stuff. OTL people like Snorri had to write in explanations of how stupid and misguided the ancients were just to be allowed to produce /Christianized/ versions of Norse legends, and I would expect that to carry over. Scholars today would likely still be digging through frozen tombs in Sweden and Norway to try reconstruct bits and pieces of the knowledge that was lost; not just magic, but also magical history.
- During feudalism and absolutism, the weakened magical society will have been essentially subjected to the whims of the nobility and the crown. This means renaissance-era politics in magical and non-magical Scandinavia will be similar, including the historical rivalry between Denmark and Sweden and the dual monarchy of Denmark-Norway.
- 19th-century nationalists OTL relied heavily on viking imagery to justify the supposed superiority of Scandinavian countries, both in Denmark, in Norway, and in Sweden. There will have been a magical cultural revival, with many ancient traditions brought back; I have some thoughts below on what these might include.
- Another popular trope in 19th-century propaganda was the desire for unification of the Nordic countries. In non-magical society this was nothing more than a political fantasy -- I expect the same holds for Wizarding society. Nevertheless, a shared cultural renaissance would have been a good basis for /some/ level of national cooperation, which we indeed also saw OTL. Magical Sweden, Denmark, and Norway would have experienced this to an even greater extent given the smaller scale of the society and the greater recognition of the pre-viking era as culturally significant. I would expect three more-or-less democratic societies joined together in a loose federation, heavily reliant on mutual defense pacts and promises of neutrality to avoid the conflicts of the wider world.
- Magical practice in Scandinavia will be divided into people practicing Roman-style magic with a wand, and revivalists/isolated groups/Icelanders practicing old magic with a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distaff][distaff]]. There will likely be a bitter history of internal political conflict between the two groups, and membership will be based mostly on familial history. Geographic location will also mean something -- revivalists will be more frequent the further North you go.
- Adding to the conflict, some revivalists will favour witches, while some Roman-style practitioners will favour wizards. Revivalists will accuse Roman-stylers of being patriarchal, misogynistic, and backwards, while Roman-stylers will accuse revivalists of being dangerously subversive quasi-socialists. Revivalist practice will include Seid-cults, female-only groups which cast ritual magic by dancing naked around bonfires at night. Roman-stylers will accuse these cults of practicing Dark Magic; this will be a big political issue for revivalists.
- A /lot/ of revivalist magic will be sacrificial in nature -- kill an animal to accomplish something, trade an eye for wisdom, trade the first seed of harvest for potency, trade sex with a spirit for magical effects. That kind of stuff. Roman-stylers will be very dismissive and skeptical.
- Swan-animagi -- especially women -- will be revered in both groups, although moreso by revivalists. The origin of this tradition lies in legends about valkyries, who in Norse (and Germanic) mythology all share the ability to take on the form of a swan. This will have blended into Wizarding culture to the point where many do not even understand /why/ swan-animagi are considered extra-magical anymore.
- Runic magic in whatever form your fic includes will obviously be held in high regard, given the association to my postulated golden age. If runes are just a language, whatever texts the runes are necessary to /read/ will be held in high regard.
- Doing business with your face covered has historically been considered /extremely/ rude in Scandinavia. Rather than erode to the point where only people like my grandmother remember it, magical society will have extended this tradition to magical forms of disguise -- polyjuice potion, glamours, invisibility cloaks, and so on.
- As for magical beasts, Trolls are the obvious native to Scandinavia -- forest-trolls, mountain-trolls, cave-trolls, expect a variety. They are smarter and more fae-like than the troll we see in book one, who we should probably assume to be an exceptionally stupid individual of the species. They are solitary creatures who unfortunately include humans in their diet, and Troll-hunters are important and respected members of Scandinavian wizarding society. Trolls flee from the ringing of churchbells, which can be key to defeating them.
- There are also /Vættir/, nature-spirits who guard certain places. They are usually benevolent, but practice blue and orange morality, so you never know when you have crossed one of their rules. They fear dragons more than anything, and carving dragon imagery on ships and buildings is commonplace to keep Vættir out. Other creatures include Lindworms (wingless, two-legged dragons), Garmr (hellhounds), Fylgja (fox-like spirits who show up to accompany wizards to fated meetings), and Brunnmigi (large predators who nest in wells and pull unsuspecting humans in). And somewhere in the North Sea, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hafgufa][Hafgufa]] is swimming around pretending to be an island.
- Scandinavia is covered in barrows, and you probably don't want to go in -- they are all haunted. Think Barrow-wights from the Lord of the Rings. Some of the larger ones are warded very well, and they draw cursebreakers from all over the world. They come for the archeology more than the treasure, as the inhabitants are buried with few valuables compared to tombs elsewhere in the world.
- Finally, Sámi people will have their own magical traditions completely distinct from the rest of Scandinavia; I am probably not the right person to comment. Similarly, it is likely that many Inuit magicals from Greenland have made their way to Denmark. Some will have started families, and there will be a subcommunity especially in Copenhagen. Expect at least some degree of racism towards these groups to be present in magical society.

** A couple ideas on magical Poland:

- Since the whole wizarding stuff in HP seems to slightly resemble nobility, with inheritance and whatnot, i'd assume it'd be like that in the rest of the world. Consequently, that would lead to Polish wizards not having much if any hard-on on blood purity since the quality amongst nobles was quite a big thing back in the day and it would most likely have been similiar in wizards.
- In addition, i doubt there is much regulation on magic thanks to those connotations - apart from obvious stuff like SoS and not harming one another there propably aren't many laws suppresing wizrds, for it is against the Golden Rule of Freedom
- Magical horses and horse-like creatures definitely are a big thing. C'mon, there must have been magical hussars.
- As far as magic goes, i think it's quite uniform across Europe, so not much change there. Apart from an unhealthy fascination with duels and mass magical brawls.
- Big focus on hospitality - i'd imagine putting up anti-apparition wards or somesuch might be considered extremely rude, especially on households of more well-known and wealthy families - you need to host your fellow wizard if he asks (again, parrarels with nobility)
- No dragons. We've had one, but some c*nt fed it sulphured sheep and it died. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wawel_Dragon]]
- Some presence on the moon. After all, our most known wizard went there: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_Twardowski]] . He also made magical mirrors, including Mirror of Erised, and at one point held the ressurection stone.
- Students either are taught by families or go to Beauxbatons (we've used to be far more friendly with the French than with most of our neighbours, and i don't see Polish people going to school in Russia or Scandinavia). There were some tries to establish a school of magic but they went down the drain during the partition.

A bit sillier idea - there used to be witchers on those lands in the ages past, protecting the common, non-magical folk from magical creatures running rampant. It's up to the interpretation whether they were wizards preffering hand-to-hand combat or muggles that were magically modified and aided with potions by some wizards. I kinda like the latter interpretation more, makes for a fun basis to allow for gifting magic to muggles after some refinement of the original technique.

** In Australia, the ones I know of come from Aboriginal oral history like the Yowie and Bunyip.

Australia has around 900 distinct indiginous groups each with their own language/dialects and customs, so each have their own stories and myths and legends.

One common theme though is shape hanging. I think having some magical creatures that change shapes would be cool. Another is a deep connection to the land.

I am not sure how to include these stories in a culturally sensitive way. Rowling came under fire for cherry picking US indiginous stories and lacked context.

Aboriginal Australia is the world's oldest civilization of about 60,000 years. I bet their magical community would be really sophisticated and deeply held within the community. I'd want to do it right.

The Witcher series has a great collection of mythical creatures that are largely based on Slavic folklore.

** i headcanon that most magical nations are more progressive than britain is, at least in regards to "blood purity." european countries especially after grindelwald's war devastated their whole continent. i imagine that many magical governments lost some respect for britain after it had two wars only fifteen years apart that were both centered around an issue that the rest of the world figured out a long time ago.

i also think that cultures around the world likely have different ways of viewing how to use magic and what magic is appropriate or inappropriate to use in certain circumstances, such as what is or isn't considered "dark magic."

this is a really great idea, thanks for posting this.
