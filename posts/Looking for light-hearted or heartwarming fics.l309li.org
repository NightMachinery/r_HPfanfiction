Just coming off a binge of several very dark angsty Fics, so I'm looking for some light-hearted and heartwarming fics.. I love magical worldbuilding, and I'm looking for creativity, uniqueness and originality in particular. I don't want cliché coffee shop AUs. I'm not a heavy romance reader but I'm willing to give it a go. I love crossovers, and I'm okay with crack as long as it's well written.

A couple of examples of what I'm looking for:

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8197451/1/Fantastic-Elves-and-Where-to-Find-Them][Fantastic Elves and Where to find them]] by EvansEntranced. After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3397283?view_full_work=true#main][Dragonheart Caravan]] by witch dragon. 5-year-old Harry Potter overhears his aunt complaining to his uncle about the "freaks" camping nearby. Maybe if they are the same type of "freak" he is they will want him?

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4437151/1/][Harry's New Home]] by Kbinz. One lonely little boy. One snarky, grumpy git. When the safety of one was entrusted to the other, everyone knew this was not going to turn out well... Or was it? AU, sequel to "Harry's First Detention".

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6331126/1/Strangers-at-Drakeshaugh?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=ff8ee55d72935ca389a5fae674c913fb60a69257-1611196139-0-AWinB1QXnBGYhS55_YlxziALu_HJkivQylCs2FNYPaiUSlPQQCdYApM5oIMwNmwtxQXrtLpup87LUXtST4K6Zkr6FY6WKIXKRxH6AxTsFw-ET7ivMR2X8IQhzUWJH5ju3Xkop5WRl1tB9_mIYNXymdcK49rCerX9HEKFBhH5432LUdW3VlB05Au9pk389verHfQAcyxZfHuhtEfnq9k1gTg0bS0BvfKCLAG2VxwLH5GjecJeRCCUYuu5qSU4wQmbL4jLgoheirzcKs7KgopLzzb0dpJ0z6f4j_hvSJ6WAkeo-VKGGKyQT6UikKwCh9pT4kI3ZHjjAHJfaFCZuAETYglnX9GpNxCQgwF8bi90OonYRFYYke6t5ZEbAXY_OB14FD3ODFksFf_-ImS_9OXxDK7V7F3t1TNNr3J_LEjudYLF][Strangers at Drakeshaugh]] by Northumbrian. The locals in a sleepy corner of the Cheviot Hills are surprised to discover that they have new neighbours. Who are the strangers at Drakeshaugh? When James Potter meets Muggle Henry Charlton, his mother Jacqui befriends the Potters and her life changes.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10588629][The Problem of Potions]] by Wyste. Once upon a time, Harry Potter hid for two hours from Dudley in a chemistry classroom, while a nice graduate student explained about the scientific method and interesting facts about acids. A pebble thrown into the water causes ripples.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8507725/1/][In Death, Standby]] by shopisme. For the better part of his bizarre early childhood Harry believed himself to be a snake. A rather dreadfully deformed snake, true, but a snake nonetheless.

  What if Sirius didn't spend twelve years in prison, but was given a trial after four years? Follow the story of Sirius Black as he learns what it means to be a father/brother/guardian to his young godson & the story of Harry Potter, a young boy with a loving home who learns about the Marauders from the two men who should have raised him. Slow-burn Hinny. M for sex & violence.

** "The Letter" is heartwarming, it's Sirius and Remus (not a couple) raise 7 year old Harry. No romance, and Harry actually talks and thinks like a 7 year old. Also, I think it's not far off from how canon Harry at age 7 would act. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11993043/1/The-Letter]]

Loose Cannon by manatee-vs-walrus I think is something you'd like. It's set about a year after Voldemort dies, Ginny dumps Harry because she's realized they aren't right for each other, and he ends up quitting auror training and playing for the Chudley Cannons. Lots of fluff, friendships, romance, and explorations of the magical world. It's super long and still going. It warms my heart a lot, and makes me feel very happy every time I read a new chapter.

Also, if you do decide to read it, there is a bit fairly early on where the use a potion and find out that Harry is average or slightly below average in magical strength? Apparently a lot of people quit the fic over this, but if you keep reading you find out that the potion has a major flaw, and it isn't actually true. So if that does make you want to quit, don't, because all is not as it seems.

  Fourteen months after the Battle of Hogwarts, an overheard, off-the-cuff comment turns Harry's life upside-down. Goodbye Auror training, hello Chudley Cannons! And witches ... lots of witches (but no harem). Heaps of dialogue and world-building, and OCs galore. Warning: Many tropes were harmed in the writing of this fic, and Cursed Child never happened. NO MORTAL PERIL.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

Luna? - Yes Tom? - I've been giving this a lot of thought...and I believe you may be insane. (Not crack. Plot takes a while to appear but it's there) See last chapter for fan art and translations.

** “How to Tame a Marauder” by Melian225 [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8074987/chapters/18503287]] and, by the same author, “The process of becoming tamed” [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9497108/chapters/21488126]]. It's marauders era, with them and OCs, some Jilly in the background and very close to Canon, with some minor changes that can be overlooked for the story (I'm quite picky and I loved it!)

It includes details from the books you'll not be expecting. I've just gone through the audio books again and found out more details! It's an awesome story!

Also, if you haven't read the other stories from Northumbrian, I highly recommend them. It's sad that some are not finished, but there's still hope :)
