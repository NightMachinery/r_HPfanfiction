It has been quite some time but I remember that Sirius didn't die and Harry was hit with a spell. Sirius couldn't bring himself to leave Harry's lifeless body and stayed at his side. Time passed and Harry came back to life again.

I can't remember more details but it's still fresh on my mind how heart wrenching it was to read.

Could you help me out? I would appreciate it a lot.

  [complete] Harry rashly makes a sacrifice in an unexpected situation. Sirius is now faced with a difficult task: to travel through the unpredictable land of the dead and guide Harry home.
