Peter isn't that well written; I feel. I mean he's suppose to be the weaker version of let's say Neville Longbottom; while Neville overcame his fears and rose to the occasion, Peter coward and stayed low in the shadows, betraying the people that cared about him.

But... that's the thing; it doesn't make sense. How are we suppose to believe that a simpering coward like Peter Pettigrew was able to follow a plan so flawlessly? Pettigrew, he was a complete and utter coward; and yet we're suppose to believe he followed a plan like betraying Lily and James without any suspicion? He killed twelve Muggles and was able to stay "dead" for years with Sirius in Azkaban? That just seems way too smart for canon Pettigrew to pull off.

I figured, oh at some point Peter was a better person, being there for James, Sirius and Remus; but even in the flashbacks and stuff that we got there was something about him that just seemed off, from Remus, James and Sirius.

Maybe that was the point, but still; I don't like that.

I want a different Peter than the one we got from canon. Maybe someone who is quiet and cunning? Someone who waits patiently until striking, that kind of thing? Maybe the Sorting Hat was going to sort him into Slytherin but Peter talked the hat into sorting him into Gryffindor (for whatever reason).

Just pretty much anything than what we got from canon Pettigrew.


** In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11191235/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Prince-of-Slytherin][Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin]] Peter works as a solicitor and also a proxy member for Potter family in Wizengamot.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** I don't think canon Peter was as much of a coward as people see him, not that it makes him a better person. Yes, he says that he betrayed Potters out of fear in the end of PoA, but he says it to try and score some sympathy points and avoid getting killed.

Peter had a Dark Mark. It's unlikely that Voldemort gave it to him after he got the address under threats of torture on October, 29. Or even if Peter came to him himself with this infrmation. Instead, he had probably been a spy in the Order for some time.

Whatever Peter said to his defence, his betrayal of the Potters and Sirius was cold-hearted, pre-planned, and required much more daring than NOT betraying them. I think his reasons for doing this had more to do with bitterness and jealousy than with cowardice.

Pettigrew is an awful excuse of a human being, he is malicious and not very smart in general, but he is resourceful and much more capable as a wizard than others give him credit for. He was not as talented as Sirius or James, sure, but he became an animagus and managed to find Voldemort very quickly when he wanted to.

Also Peter is Gryffindor alright. Just like not all Sytherins are bad, not all Gryffindors are good, and loyalty as actually a Hufflepuff trait.

** peter was weak, and a coward. he got leaned on and broke under the pressure.

i think that exchange between him and sirius in the shrieking shack says it all.

where peter says, i would have gotten killed. and sirius says, then you should have died.

those were the stakes. could you have been as courageous as sirius demands? would you die for your friends?

i'd like to think i would, but i dunno

*** I mean, it doesn't make that much sense. If Peter managed to stay incognito for 12 fucking years, from Death Eaters and The Ministry alike, I am sure he could have evaded Voldemort if he wanted.

Especially before taking the Mark, so it makes no sense for him to say he took the Mark because he feared for his life.

He could go to another country, ask for a fidelius or spend a couple years as a rat.

It wasn't the " sell your friends OR die" that you are making it out to be. He had other options before he took the Mark. And even after. Hell, he could have asked for Asylum in Hogwarts even after he took the mark if he could convince Dumbledore that he would break it off with Voldemort.

He had options.

Which is why he is evil and not just a poor little coward stuck between a rock and a hard place. I hate how people, when they analyze the books, just take the characters' words as gospel. This is a recurring theme when talking about these novels ("Dumbledore said X, therefore..."). Pettigrew is no exception.

How crazy do you have to be to compare Pettigrew, a total piece of shit, to someone as good and brave as Neville?! Just because Neville is a little timid...

**** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11302568/13/][Well this chapter of this fanfic]] tries to answer the question of why Pettigrew stayed. While it is primarily a Smart!Dark! Harry fic, Pettigrew's perspective isn't that far divorced from Canon.

Tl:DR it is a mixture of complancey, laziness and a need to suck up to someone powerful for "protection".

** That is honestly a pet peeve of mine. Peter was trusted. They made him a secret keeper! They obviously had some faith in him. Although he was a coward he was clever; he managed to be a death eater and stay in good graces, with his friends none the wiser. Like that was some pretty finely executed betrayal.

Also a lot of marauder period fanfics just dump on him constantly or imply that he was a useless nuisance that they are annoyed with and I think that pretty unrealistic.

*** Or even if that was the case, they'd still treat him better than that in fanfics.

I mean; they're friends with Sirius Black, whose family is known for hating Muggleborns and whose family uses dark magic.

They're also friends with Remus Lupin, who is a werewolf; a marked "dark creature"

So even if Pettigrew wasn't as great in school and the like; the way that Remus, Sirius and James treat Peter in fanfiction is very unrealistic.

Kind of like in stories where Harry's sorted into Slytherin, his parents and Sirius are alive and hate him, they wouldn't hate him; or find out that he can talk to snakes; especially given what I posted above, with Sirius being born from a dark family, and Remus being classified as a dark creature.

So yeah, that often gets me to drop the story super fast.

Similar to wrong boy who lived stories; they wouldn't just abandon Harry like that, even if they did think that Harry's twin was the sibling who lived.

It was believable that the Marauders drifted apart once James paired up with Lily, and Remus and Sirius paired up with each other, so Peter was left alone. He got new friends.

#+end_quote

It's quite easy - all he has to do is squeal to Voldemort about their location, and Voldemort takes care of the rest. The only ones who know he's the secret keeper are Lily, James and Sirius. Lily and James are killed, and Sirius makes it known that he's the Secret Keeper, to throw the Death Eaters and Voldemort off the identity of the real one. Which means that a lot of people (including those in the Order) think that Sirius is the Secret Keeper.

When Peter fakes his death, there really isn't much to be done, since it looks like Sirius killed 14 people and betrayed the Potters to Voldemort.

#+begin_quote
  He killed twelve Muggles
#+end_quote

Honestly, this part isn't explained all that well. The muggles could have easily been collateral damage in the fight between Peter and Sirius. Or maybe Peter got his hands on a grenade, who knows?

** Not to toot my own horn, but I wrote a chapter on Peter and why he betrayed James and co. My premise was Peter had a younger step-sib who was sorted into Slytherin and the Marauder's bullied her so bad that she commited suicide rather than go back to school with them in it. Something had to have happened that made Peter turn against his friends. Was a family member threatened? Did James or Sirius do something that was unforgivable?

  January 1981. Sirius is a paranoiac, Peter is not a psychopath, James is a dad, Remus is super angry, and Regulus... Regulus is alive. No-one is more surprised than him. AU, sort of fix-it, but dark enough. Sirius/Remus, too (mostly in the past).

  Sooner or later, every character gets their shot at a second chance. This is Peter Pettigrew's. He may not deserve it but he certainly wasn't happy with how things ended up. The only question was how to get a better future without having to possess the kind of bravery that the lack of had sent him running to Voldemort in the first place...

** I quite like MarauderLover7's Peter.

He's in the Innocent series as a pretty minor but still interesting character for the first few, but then gets a bigger, more dramatic role in Harry's 3rd year (Impose, I think?). [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9469064/1/Innocent]]

He's also really well written in Dark Days, which is waaaay shorter than the Innocent series, and is set a few months before the end of the first war. The whole last chapter is Peter's pov: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9462005/1/Dark-Days]]

** Found this thread while I was wondering why in the world would James and Lily think that switching to Peter as the Secret Keeper was a good plan. Heck, even using Sirius Black as the Secret Keeper was pretty dumb. I really can't fathom what they were thinking especially when it's been pointed out in other fics that either James or Lily could have been the Secret Keeper just as how Bill became the Secret Keeper for Shell Cottage.
