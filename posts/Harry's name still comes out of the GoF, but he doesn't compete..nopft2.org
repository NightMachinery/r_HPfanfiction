You know how Ludo Bagman and Crouch Sr are usually there for the Choosing of the champions. Well, their counterparts from France and, wherever Dumstrang is, are also there. So they come up with a way for Harry to not compete in the TWT.

​

As for the Request, are there any fics out there where Dumbledore, Maxime, or Karkaroff come up with something so Harry doesn't have to compete?


** The headmasters/headmistress of the wizarding schools don't really get a chance to let Harry out (Dumbledore doesn't want to) in linkffn(When Fate Intervened) but it's still “Harry doesn't compete” and also a fun read

  My first attempt at writing. When Harry's name comes out of the Goblet of Fire Dumbledore gives him a choice. Either participate in the tournament or lose his magic and leave Hogwarts. The Headmaster would never have guessed that Harry would lash out angrily and choose the latter. Minor Ron and Dumbledore bashing at the start. Wizarding War on a quicker timescale than in canon.

*** Once I started reading, I noticed I've read it before. Don't remember why I didn't finish it. Guess I'll find out. Thanks anyhow.
