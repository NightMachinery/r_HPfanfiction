I like stories that take place during the First War and particularly ones that focus on the marauders and/or Snape. Doesn't have to focus specifically on the war just something in that time frame. Ones I've read and liked:

Linkao3(a dream carved in stone) Snape/Lily

Linkao3(are we yet free men?) Some minor Snape/Lupin but mostly Lupin centric

Linkao3(LD50) Canon pairings, WIP

Would especially love anything focusing on the Dumbledore and Snape relationship.

  AU: When an unmarried Lily Evans joins the Order of the Phoenix, Dumbledore gives her a simple mission: meet with the Death Eater Severus Snape and tell him what she's done.

  Twenty-year-old Remus Lupin tries to keep the werewolves on the side of the light. He's accepted it might cost him his life, but that's easier to reconcile than the other costs. Even if they win, who will he be, after he's seen the depths in himself?

  It's 1981, and the walls are closing in. There is a spy in the Order. Lily, James, and infant Harry Potter are in hiding but not safe under Fidelius yet. Severus Snape is not a trusted enough Death Eater to pass on crucial information, and Dumbledore still doubts Snape's loyalty. Peter Pettigrew is chewing at the walls where no one can see. And poison persists in the blood.
