** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6638886/1/I-Don-t-Really-Need-Protection][I Don't Really Need Protection]]: All too often in the H/Hr stories, when Ron loses his temper and confronts the couple for getting together, Hermione always cringes, and/or flees...what if she didn't?

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6120485/1/The-Harmony-Ball][The Harmony Ball]]: What would have happened if on the way back to his common room after been rejected by Cho for a date to the Yule Ball, Harry realizes there is another witch he would be just as happy to attend the ball with.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7470334/1/Yes-She-s-a-Girl][Yes She's a Girl]]: What if the lead up to the Yule Ball played out just a little bit differently? One thing leads to another, and Harry's life becomes much less stressful. H/Hr Note: This is a Horcrux and Hallows free story.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4967871/1/What-If-ooo-Another-Goblet-of-Fire-Alternative][What If? -Another Goblet of Fire Alternative-]] and its sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5265558/1/What-If-An-Alternative-to-Order-Of-The-Phoenix][What If? -An Alternate to Order of the Phoenix-]]: Many fanfics speculate about what would have happened if Harry had asked Hermione to the Yule Ball. Or what if he had taken Ginny to the Ball? Here's a twist. What if he had done both? And what else in the story might have changed as a result?

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9891912/1/The-Power-of-Quidditch][The Power of Quidditch]]: The outrage over having the Quidditch season cancelled was muted too quickly in canon. A fourth year Gryffindor witch decides that someone needs to do something to rescue her best friend from impending disaster, and she has just the tool to fix both problems. (This one doesn't actually have Harry asking Hermione to the ball, but it's strongly implied.)

** I am not 100% sure about the ball, but this was an awesome HHr story set in that year. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7392700/1/Banking-on-Her][Banking on her.]] Took a day to remember the title.
