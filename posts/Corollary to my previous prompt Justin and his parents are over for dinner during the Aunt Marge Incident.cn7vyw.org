You can get them there however you like, they just have to be there for dinner when Aunt Marge does her ranting about Mrs. Potter. Bonus points if you inlude a reaction to the cover story of St. Brutus's.

** Since no one posted anything, here's mine.

"Oh, thank you so much for coming, Edmund! My brother Vernon can't wait to meet you!" Marge said as Edmund Finch-Fletchley led his family to the Dursley home for a long-awaited meeting with Marge's brother. Edmund, being a gracious guest, said, "Marge, it's lovely to see you. Please let us in."

Edmund went in and shoo hands with Vernon, and introduced himself. Vernon said, "You're the right sort of bloke! I hear you and Marge get along quite well! Is that your son over there?" Edmund looked at the over large man and said "Yes. Justin, this is Mr. Dursley, Vernon, this is my son Justin."Justin sheepishly shook his hand, and Petunia said, "Oh, you look handsome all dressed up! You simply must meet my son Dudley. I think the two of you will be fast friends. Dudley goes to a boarding school too, you know." Justin looked at her, nonplussed at her offer, but said, "Yeah. That'd be great." Petunia called Dudley down from his room, and Dudley made the eternal mistake of dragging a beaten Harry down the stairs. Petunia looked at Dudley and said, "Dudley, you did a great thing bringing your cousin down. I think we need to take a look at him. What happened?" Dudley pouted, "Just a little roughhousing. You know, like what cousins do." Victoria, Edmund's wife, chimed in. "I think I'll take a look at him. You make sure Dudley behaves." Victoria took Harry out of sight. After that, Edmund said, "I think I need to use the loo. Vernon, could you show me? Perhaps Marge and Petunia could go out to the back garden?"

Edmund used the loo and went out of the bathroom to find Vernon still standing there. Edmund sensed an opportunity and said, "May we speak privately?" Vernon led him into the home office, and Edmund rounded on him as soon as the door closed. "You could've at least told Harry that his parents were killed by the IRA." Vernon's usually purple face turned red, and he blurted out, "How do you know this? Your son goes to one of those posh schools, Marge tells me. That /freak/ goes to St. Brutus's School for Incurably Criminal Boys--"

Edmund cut him off and gave him the most angry gaze he'd ever give. "Don't play games. Harry and Justin go to the same school, and I know this for a fact. My son tells me your nephew is a saint and wouldn't hurt a fly unless you did something."

Vernon caustically replied, "HA! That boy a saint! That's the funniest thing I've heard in a long time. He was so bad that we had to give him a beating or two to straighten him out. You know, Marge had this great idea of putting him in a cupboard to lessen the damage he's done. Poor boy lost his parents and his sanity." Edmund simply looked at him and said, "You and Dudley. Pack. His. Things. /Now!/" Vernon ran down the stairs. Edmund, meanwhile, went to Harry's room and saw the decrepit state it was in. He opened up the drawers and the closet to find... old toys. Not a single article of clothing was in that room except for Harry's pyjamas. Edmund sighed and picked them up.

Victoria was in the formal parlor with Harry and said, "How often does he do this to you?" Harry lied, "Not that often. He and I don't really get on, so we stay away from each other." Victoria raised her eyebrows and opined, "I think you're lying. My husband is a politician, so he has to lie all the time, so I can spot one from a mile away. We're going to try this again: how often does he do this to you?" Harry blushed and amended his statement. "All the time. he and his friends, they bully me constantly. Beat me up, lots of bruises and black eyes." Victoria said, "We're going to have dinner soon. After that, Mr. Edmund is going to have your uncle and cousin pack your things... unless your uncle wants his life to become a lot more complicated."

Dudley took Justin to his room and proudly said, "This is my room. I used to have two, but the freak took my second one because of some crackpot sending him a letter that said the cupboard under the stairs a few years ago. He's mostly away from us learning his freakish shite. Wanna play Doom?" Jusin turned around and locked the door behind them, and Dudley got a wry smile on his face. "Ah, so you want to see a few birds! I got just the thing, let me get under the mattress and pull them out." Justin let Dudley do so. After a few minutes of Justin laughing on the inside, he finally struck.

Dudley howled in pain.

"WHAT WAS THAT FOR?" He held his lower region tightly in his hands. Justin seethed, "Don't play dumb, it's unbecoming." After a few minutes of just staring at him, Justinn said, "Get up! Come on, piggy, get up!" Dudley slowly got up, then pleaded with Justin, "Please... I don't know what I did to piss you off, but I'm sorry!" Justin scoffed, "Why apologize to me? I'm not the one you and your father /mercilessly tortured/ for most of his life. Putting him in a cupboard under the stairs, my father wouldn't even do that to the IRA!" Justin paused for a few minutes to catch his breath and to calm down. He said, "I think we should get ready for dinner, don't you?"

Dinner was a very tense affair. Marge said, "Oh, this food is delicous. You know, it's such a shame your sister ended up with the wrong crowd. Married that drunk, died in a car crash. Poor boy must've been so torn up... got to keep him on a tight leash, I'd say. A few canings at St. Brutus's could've done some good. After all, if there's something wrong with the bitch, there's something wrong with the pup."

Edmund slammed his hands down on the table and stood up. "Marge Dursley, how dare you! And to think I counted you as one of my dear friends. You have no right to speak ill of the dead, /especially/ if her son can clearly hear you! Dudley, is Harry's stuff packed?"

Vernon sid, "Now see here--"

Edmund cut him off, "No, Vernon, /you/ see /here/. Just like I said to you earlier, you could've done something great with Harry, but you done messed that up. Family, we're leaving! Marge can give you my address to have Harry's things shipped to us. We will never darken your doorstep again."
