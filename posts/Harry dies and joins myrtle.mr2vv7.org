** Ok, so I have a super rough AU idea about how the war would end if this happened.

So, it would count that Harry dies at Voldemort's hand because ‘Tom' in the diary is just a younger Voldemort. Voldemort then goes on to do whatever he does in canon, but once news of Harry's death reaches him (probably through one of his followers like Barry Crouch or another Death Eater that decided to eventually search for him), he figures he can go ahead with his plans of Word Domination ^{TM} and eventually gets around to retrieving the prophecy sphere from the Department of Mysteries. He nabs it off the shelf, listens to it, and figures that he can't be killed again because Harry Potter is already dead and there won't be any other suitable candidates to kill him after he gets rid of the other object of the prophecy, Neville. Discounting Harry from the prophecy now, he then shifts his focus onto Neville and tries to kill him to ensure he will rule unopposed.

Neville takes on Harry's role in having Dumbledore ‘train' him with the penseive memories, dragging Harry's friends along with him on his own Horcrux Hunt. Eventually, the final battle at Hogwarts arrives, but since Neville doesn't have a Horcrux in him like Harry did, he dies out in the forest. Voldemort then returns to the castle and announces that he's won the war. Everyone who keeps fighting ends up going underground, and once the focus shifts back on to Harry (because Neville isn't around anymore and he may be dead, but he's still in the prophecy) he uses his ghostliness to ferry messages between people and their kids that are held hostage in Hogwarts. The Order manages to cobble itself back together with Hermione's help a few months after they escape Hogwarts. She organizes the Order and sets up plans to rescue some of the kids at Hogwarts, and succeeds many times before Voldemort catches on and ambushes her, ruining those plans.

Then it progresses like a normal persecution-filled world until Voldemort dies of Harry spooking him in the bathroom or something, making him slip on the tiles and crack his skull open.
