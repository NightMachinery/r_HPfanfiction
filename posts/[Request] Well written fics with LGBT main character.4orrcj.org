** Linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/928195]])

Transman! Remus fic. Speaking as a trans woman, this author gets everything right. From the desire to be stealth, the reluctance to be intimate with your partner, to the utter gut wrenching terror of being outed to your best friends. This fic is perfect and Snape can go to fucking hell.

Linkffn([[https://fanfiction.net/s/10290899/]])

Best Harry/Draco fic I've ever read, great plot and an incredibly satisfying Umbridge death.

Linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/951061]])

This is a Harry/Hermione/Ron fic that covers Bisexual persons and poly people but please keep in mind that being Bi does not mean you need/want to date more than one person at a time. Also please keep in mind that a bisexual man who's dating a man is still bisexual and the same would still be true if he were dating a woman.

I haven't found any lesbian stuff that doesn't read like some straight guys wank material and neither have I ever found a fic about a trans woman that I would call good. If anyone here has found one let they like I'd love to see it.

  HPDM slash. There is no reason for the Ministry to pull Unspeakable Draco Malfoy off his Dark artifacts detail and assign him to negotiate with Harry Potter's werewolf pack. Draco suspects a set up. When he meets Harry, however, he has to wonder if it's a different kind of set up than he anticipated. Updated every Tuesday. COMPLETE.

** linkffn(Holly Evans and the Spiral Path) it's very dark in spots, and very funny in spots. there is an animated table named Octogagall(?). Tonks and Holly discuss moving to New Zeeland and becoming farmers, with a flock of sheep named after Wizengamot members. It's an all time fave of mine.. ymmv

might try linkffn(The Butterfly Effect) fem!harry/ginny EDIT: the bot got the wrong one: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6008512/1/A-Butterfly-Effect]]

linkffn(Effects and Side Effects) is my go to guilty pleasure. no glaring errors in SP&G, the plot is fairly predictable not sure if it qualifies as well written as that decision is pretty subjective.

I tried a transgender Harry in linkffn(Red Headed Step Child by sfjoellen) It's not horrible.

** linkffn(Teeth) is a HP/Avengers crossover, where Harry gets in some sort of animagus mishap and leaves the wizarding world. He is not very amorous, and there is a nearly complete lack of romance/pairing, but I'm pretty sure I remember something about him swinging both ways. I quite liked it when I read it (its an ongoing w.i.p.), but in retrospect it has quite a few tropes that I strongly dislike, and I'm more than a bit curious how I remember it so fondly when I dislike so many things it has. Huh. But anyhoo, I liked it, Harry is (if you have to give him a description, for his lack of sexy-times) bi, and I think it was well written or believable. Or something.

edit: it's not that one. missed the ball on that one, bot, when the pitch was way outside.

I'm almost in the same boat as you. I remember liking it a lot, but can't really remember a thing about it!

** Well, I know I always link it on these threads, but one of my favourites was linkffn(Those Gilded Chains We Wear by KuraiBites), which is a slow-burn fic in which Hermione has to deal with the realisation that she's a lesbian. Weird pairing (Hermione/Bellatrix, post-DH with mild AU), but very well developed. Manages to make Bellatrix freaking Lestrange a believably sympathetic character.

Also seconding A Butterfly Effect, even if it can be rather grimdark in places.

Maybe linkffn(Image of You by angelic1hp)? Semi-tragic HGGW, post-DH, in which Ginny manages to destroy Hermione's comfortable, safe and unsatisfying life with Ron, in the name of feelings they can't contain, and the experience leaves them ultimately broken people, but... together, with a glimmer of hope for the better.

It's old, but I quite like (Entwined by OrbitalWings) for my Fleurmione fix. Very much a cute teen romance by comparison to the above, but believable for it. I like it because it's short enough to maintain romantic tension throughout, rather than lapsing into repetitive fluff chapters as a lot of Fleurmione is wont to do.

Edit: forgot to link Entwined properly, sorry about that.

This story is fantastic. One of the best Harry Potter stories I've ever read.

linkao3(Lithium by grayclouds) is also great. One of the few stories I'm still keeping up with.

  The smallest change in details can lead to vastly different outcomes. When Harry finds Tom Riddle's diary in his second year, he befriends the entity that resides within. This simple act results in a ripple effect that tears the story as we know it apart, causing a descent into the madness that is the human psyche.
