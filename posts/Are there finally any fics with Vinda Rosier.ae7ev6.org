** She might appear in Voldemort time travel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13088810/1/Carpe-Noctem][Carpe Noctem]], linkffn(13088810). This fic already mentions a Rosier fighting for Grindelwald, but that person is clearly male.

#+begin_quote
  When Voldemort died at the Battle of Hogwarts, nothing had prepared him to reawaken as Tom Riddle circa 1943, rid of his madness but left with a gnawing sense of defeat. Things may have gone wrong the first time around, but Tom vowed not to let the course of history run unchanged. He could do better, and this time... no one would stop him.
