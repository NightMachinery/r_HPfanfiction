I want good novel length crossovers. I would prefer ones with a paring. I prefer starwars, lord of the rings, marvel.


** Luckely for you, I happen to have a slight obsession with HP crossovers. (I'm going to have to do this in two comments, It won't let me do it all in one. Sorry)

*Final Fantasy xv*

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18501823/chapters/43844539][Hated You From Hello]] - Harry Potter meets Cor Leonis. He is not impressed. Neither is the young Insomnian. 10/10 Probably my faverout fanfiction of all time. you dont need any prior knowlage of ffXV.

/The Gryffindor paused, blinking at the stranger. He was about his age, wearing a military uniform of all things, and bristling like a Coeurl fixing to pick a fight, his boots were shiny and black, his uniform was clean and pressed, his hands and fingernails were also clean, and there wasn't a single button or seam out of place. Even his sword-sheath gleamed, shiny, clean, and flawless. Stood in blood and sweat stiffened leathers, with mud up to his thighs, dirt under his nails, across his cheeks, twigs in his hair, and his pistols dented and caked with blood after he used them to club the last of his prey to death, he felt incredibly dirty and small in front of the other teenager who was already close to hitting six foot while Harry had only just reached 5'3”./

/He hated him immediately./

** Linkffn(13274956) It's not really the kind of crossover you asked for, but this is probably the most entertaining FanFic I have ever read. So far it plays mainly in the Percy Jackson Universe and the only HP Characters beside Harry is the Lovegood family. But after I finish a chapter of this story I always have a smile on my face.

** Part 2

*Marvel*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8208936/1/Wanderer][Wanderer]] - Life's a lot easier when no one knows you and your only worry is whether or not people in each world speak the same languages you do. Harry can attest to it; he's been jumping for years. He knows how to keep his head down and not get invested. On hindsight, with his track record, Harry supposed it was only a matter of time until he did exactly that.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10997165/1/The-Widow-and-the-Wizard][The Widow and the Wizard]] - "Would you like to come with me?" Harry stared at her eyes, big and green like his. Anything would be better than returning with the Dursleys, he believed it firmly. So he slipped this small hand into hers and held onto it tightly. AssassinInTraining!Harry Eventual Clintasha

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11537017/1/One-Soldier-Two][One Soldier, Two]] - Evangeline Potter is used to damning the Potter Luck. This time though, she's beginning to see just why no Potter ever went to a Curse Breaker about the issue. Bucky Barnes is certainly not about to start complaining. Fem!Harry/Bucky. Don't own.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11627720/1/The-Wizard-and-The-Super-Soldier][The Wizard and The Super Soldier]] - 2 Years Post War. After the Battle of Hogwarts, Ron betrays Harry and Hermione, and they are left on the run for two years. After being caught and escaping Azkaban, Harry decides to do the greatest vanishing act in the world, going through the Veil. On the other side, he meets a man that desperately needs help, and makes great changes to Harry's life. MOD! Harry Slash *On Hiatus*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11426820/1/The-Sorceress][The Sorceress]] - Nine hundred years since she defeated Voldemort. And nine hundred years since she fled the wizarding world. Alexis Potter is the Mistress Of Death, alone until she meets Tony Stark. She now works for him and has become his best friend. But there are things about her he doesn't know. It's just the two of them at first, until she picks up a couple of extras on the way. Fem/harry.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9348546/1/Ink-Stains][Ink Stains]] - In which Harry was sealed inside Tom Riddle's diary during his second year and tossed into another world, upon where he finds himself in Bruce Banner's lonely hands. With the life Banner leads, he supposes that he shouldn't be surprised by this "Harry Potter" being. Really, there wasn't enough coffee in the world to deal with this.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10835321/1/Behind-the-Shield][Behind the Shield]] - It was a good thing the new scientist, Dr. Harry Evans, was working out so well. Because nothing else was going Fury's way. And that was before Loki made off with the Tesseract and some of his people. Maybe AU to Mortem Cantor by Kyandua.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8212843/1/I-See-The-Moon][I See The Moon]] - Gen. "While on the run, Bruce meets a young man who speaks to the moon. He's probably not quite the sanest friend Bruce could have made, but, well...beggers can't be choosers."

A cat-and-mouse game ensues when Stark's curiosity drives him to ever-increasing lengths to capture his invisible benefactor, who struggles with maintaining her distance.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8105139/1/Hurricane][Hurricane]] - He only ever wanted to bring Sirius back, but in Harry's life nothing ever goes the way he wants it to. LokixHary.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8105674/1/Taking-Chances][Taking Chances]] - AU. He left before they could do anything about it. It was for the best.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8282559/1/Trouble-Finds-Him][Trouble Finds Him]] - While working in the Ministry as Head Auror Harry intervenes during a raid in the Time Chamber.The attackers are after The Sands of Time.Harry rescues the object but when hit with the killing curse while holding the ancient object Harry is teleported to another time...to another world.He wakes up in 1940 New York and meets Howard Stark,and goes down with the ship just like Steve...

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8148717/1/Finding-Home][Finding Home]] - When Harry finally accepted the fact that he had stopped aging, ten years had passed and he knew it was time to leave. AU.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8750290/1/Moved-by-the-Law-of-Probability][Moved by the Law of Probability]] - The probability of Harry Potter living a completely normal life was low, but that was okay. Normality is over-rated and boring anyway. He's managed to do some pretty interesting things with his life since the war. Don't own, not canon compliant.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8410168/1/Steve-And-The-Barkeep][Steve And The Barkeep]] - Steve has a routine, and god help him if he's going to break that routine for anyone - yes, that includes you, Tony. Enter a local barkeeper with a penchant for the occult and the gift of good conversation. EWE, not slash, just a couple of guys and a few hundred drinks. Rated for fear of the thought police.

*Doctor Who*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13555075/1/Penumbra][Penumbra]] - It's not everyday that you find out that you're actually an alien, and that you were accidentally kidnapped as a baby by the Department of Mysteries. At this point however, Harry's not really surprised.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13366223/1/Count-To-Four][Count To Four]] Harry always knew he was different, he just had to count to four to prove it. [Part 1 of The Master (of Death)]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12894968/1/Two-Hearts-Are-Better-Than-One][Two Hearts Are Better Than One]] - In third year, Harry Potter has a near fatal accident with a time turner while trying to save his godfather. Now Harry's not quite human and is beginning to have memories that aren't his own. The Doctor is now searching for the young Time Lord that he mentally sensed with a far-fetched hope that he is not alone. TimeLord!Harry

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13244319/1/Space-Time-and-Magic-Book-1][Space, Time and Magic: Book 1]] - When Hermione visit's her Aunt and cousin for Christmas, she expected a quiet holiday. What she never expected was the Doctor to literally crash into it, let alone find her soulmate in him. Will she survive travelling with him and a jealous Rose? (10th Doctor/Hermione) Rose bashing. First Book in Space, Time and Magic. Complete.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13019645/1/The-True-Master][The True Master]] - In his fight to defeat the Master, the Doctor initially overlooks the man's adopted son. But when the end of the world begins, the unassuming young man who goes by Corvus Saxon shows that perhaps he has his own agenda. The Doctor discovers an interest in Corvus, during the year they are stuck together, that only deepens the more he looks. (AU! Season 3 ending) (10thDr/MoDHP)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12866047/1/The-Fourth-Hallow][The Fourth Hallow]] - Harry has lived far longer then he ever wanted - longer then he felt he had any right to. Death could no longer take him. A final attempt to join his loved ones saw him meeting Death once more, but instead of dying, the being sent him to another world. One where Time was her own person, and there was another so much like himself. What's an immortal to do, when meeting such a man?

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9085310/1/A-Doctor-A-Harry-and-An-Angel][A Doctor, A Harry, and An Angel]] - Harry is pushed through the Veil, on the other side he meets an angel, and then a Doctor. Doctor/Harry slash.

** Lion's Pride - There are areas in the Department of Mysteries off-limits for very good reasons. When Harry stumbles into one of them, he finds himself reborn, literally, into a new world.

** Meet Me on the Battlefield - Six months and still no one has come for Harry yet. But that's fine. Breaking through across worlds probably takes time, he can be patient. There's plenty here in Eos for him to be dealing with in the meantime. He has to find a means to put a roof over Kimya's head, handle the remaining doors, juggle a war, a boyfriend, the Royal family, the Astrals, and the enemy.

** Wesk,” the teenager growled unhappily and Harry glanced to the Retainer as he cheerfully waved a small white square and vanished the camera away with the other.He squinted at the sly smirk lingering in the corner of the man's dark mouth, “How many pictures of us have you taken?” he asked suspiciously, he'd seen a few from the beach, but he definitely wasn't dumb enough not to believe he had taken more. After all, the Retinue seemed to think their relationship coming together had been a great form of entertainment since day one.The barely concealed shit-eating grin did not reassure him. “Oh... a few,” he dismissed with an airy gesture as he examined his photograph, his expression softening slightly before he held it out, “This is one of the better ones though, I would wager.”

** No Longer Empty - Harry is growing annoyed at the ongoing war so he goes snooping. When he finds a kid in a pod waiting to be decommissioned he's not going to leave him behind.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11120132/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Elves-Most-Fabulous][Harry Potter and the Elves Most Fabulous]] - Crack treated kind of seriously. /Elfling!Harry. Except not. Jaded and cynical Master Auror Harry Potter gets sent to Arda to relive his non-existent childhood. Childhood sucks. Rated M for language./

*Dr Who*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13624319/1/Show-Me-The-Way-Home][Show Me The Way Home]] - Second in the series, Best Dr Who series in my opinion. When Harry, or, uh, Koschei, or... Whatever, wakes up in an unfamiliar place and time, he finds himself struggling to find a way back to his home. [Sequel to Count To Four - Part 2 of The Master (of Death)]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13366223/1/Count-To-Four][Count To Four]] - Part 1 in the series. Harry always knew he was different, he just had to count to four to prove it. [Part 1 of The Master (of Death)] Harry/Doctor.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12894968/1/Two-Hearts-Are-Better-Than-One][Two Hearts Are Better Than One]] - In third year, Harry Potter has a near fatal accident with a time turner while trying to save his godfather. Now Harry's not quite human and is beginning to have memories that aren't his own. The Doctor is now searching for the young Time Lord that he mentally sensed with a far-fetched hope that he is not alone. TimeLord!Harry

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13019645/1/The-True-Master][The True Master]] - In his fight to defeat the Master, the Doctor initially overlooks the man's adopted son. But when the end of the world begins, the unassuming young man who goes by Corvus Saxon shows that perhaps he has his own agenda. The Doctor discovers an interest in Corvus, during the year they are stuck together, that only deepens the more he looks. (AU! Season 3 ending) (10thDr/MoDHP)

*Once*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12804397/1/Time-to-Go-Home][Time to Go Home]] - It was obvious to Hermione that some outside force was at work here; Henry's strange appearance with a magical storybook in tow provided enough evidence that something bigger was going on, though what it had to do with her sister she was unsure. Hermione just hoped that he was wrong and that it had nothing to do with fairytales- she'd had enough of those to last her a lifetime.

*Sherlock*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13019580/1/Mystery-Child][Mystery Child]] - When bodies started showing up in London, even Sherlock was stumped. But then one turns up alive; a secretive child with an impossible past. In trying to crack open the boy, Sherlock is confronted with his own inability to open himself to others. It's a battle of stubbornness between the two. John's just amused at it all for once. AU! Post season 2

  Not having received any word from his friends and also seeing what the Daily Prophet had written about him, Harry felt both betrayed and depressed. Then his uncle decided that he needed a job. A job that turned out to be at a pizzeria Harry had many good childhood memories of. The young wizard could never have guessed that becoming a night guard would change his future...
