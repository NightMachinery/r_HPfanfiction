  Harry has been entered into the Triwizard Tournament against his will, and his friends don't believe him when he insists he didn't enter his name. Will Ginny Weasley sit by and watch him suffer alone, or will she risk exposing the dark secret she has been hiding. GoF re-write from Ginny's POV. Smart & slightly manipulative Ginny! Extreme Ron-bashing!

  "Haven't you wondered if there's more to the world then a backwards, prejudiced society?" When Harry asks Astoria Greengrass this question in a fit of temper after he's forced to compete in the tournament, he wasn't expecting her answer - or that he'd go along with her decision to run away with him and see the world. Can two different people find happiness? HarryxAstoria

** Canon? Everyone's pretty obnoxious about Harry getting into the tournament in the first place, with the Potter Stinks badges and stuff.

Well, until he ends up taking on an effing dragon in the first task, anyway. What more did you have in mind?
