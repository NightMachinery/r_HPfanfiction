I think he has a different name. Hermione is evil and a water elemental. Hermione creates a backdoor into Harry's mind while he was sleeping. Dumbledore gives Harry a rare artifact that stores fire energy(?). I think there is a scene where the salamander is running through the halls??? There were two other elementals but I don't remember who they were (either Ginny and Ron, or Neville and Luna).

  He controlled the elements, it wasn't enough. He was the powerful light wizard, but Voldemort was winning. Fate sent him back. No Slash please read, future Harry going back in time! Slight AU- Retains older body. fifth year Grammer fixed.
