Basically looking for fics showing how the relationship between Dumbledore and Snape evolved after Snape first switched sides.


** Work in progress. This writer is wonderful at conveying emotional tension.

#+begin_quote
  In scientific parlance, an LD50 is an amount of a substance that constitutes a lethal dose for fifty percent of the tested population. Everything from poisons to common medications in your cabinet right now has an LD50. It's 1981, and the walls are closing in. There is a spy in the Order. Lily, James, and infant Harry Potter are in hiding but not safe under Fidelius yet. Severus Snape is not a trusted enough Death Eater to pass on crucial information, and Dumbledore still doubts Snape's loyalty. Peter Pettigrew is chewing at the walls where no one can see. And poison persists in the blood.
