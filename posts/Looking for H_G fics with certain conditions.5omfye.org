I love H/G as a pair, but I feel like it often gets watered down to a soppy relationship where literally nothing bad ever happens (either that or it barely gets focused on in the story), along with bad characterisation of the characters

so yeah, my specific requests are

1. no OOC. please. i don't want to see them as the next Dark Lord and Lady

2. I'm fine with AU as long as it's done in a realistic, sensible way (eg. Innocent series, even though it has no MC pairings in it yet other than Remus and Sirius's relationships, is well written and has the characters act the way as they should in canon). hell, I might even want it more over canon-compliant stories

3. as I said, no overly soppy stuff that feels fake - nobody wants to hear someone calling them 'love' every other sentence, /especially/ if they're not even 21 yet

4. no bashing, this is just kind of a general thing

5. no '1 year after' fics, I've read the main authors that make these (eg. Northumbrian) to get sick of the common tropes and clichés in them (/Fred is dead./ every other fucking paragraph)

6. nothing too angsty, I like lighthearted fun ones bc let's be honest hearing about how Harry is guilty over literally everything is really boring

I know this isn't /that/ specific, but these things come up in popular pairings way too often. just-post-war fics are also really common with this pairing

please help guys, and thanks in advance


** "Abraxas", linkffn(11580650): Super Harry/Ginny fighting off both Voldemort and [[/spoiler][Muggles]]

"Backward With Purpose Part I: Always and Always", linkffn(4101650): Despite my gripe with its plot, it's still a very well written Harry/Ginny story.

"Children's Crusade", linkffn(6989327): Don't let the main character names mislead you, Harry and Ginny are just as important as Ron and Hermione in this fic. With only 49 Favorites on FF.net, it's quite a hidden gem.

"Elemental Harry", linkffn(5648259): A cute super Harry/Ginny story.

"Ginny Returns", linkffn(4740107): The only completed Ginny-only time travel. She finished her primary objective efficiently and painlessly, but ran into a few unexpected troubles.

"Gothic", linkffn(11922116): Harry never went to Hogwarts, and hired Ginny to go with him on some adventures after the war. But the end is....

"In Case of Emergency", linkffn(4625848): It's a pretty good smut fic with a decent plot.

"My Slytherin Harry", linkffn(6160345): It's short, but nevertheless a very satisfying story.

"The Bonds of Blood", linkffn(5435295): They developed a soul bond after the CoS, but that doesn't mean they had to like it.

"The Dark Lord Never Died" , linkffn(11773877): This is technically a Ron/Hermione story, but Harry and Ginny do play an important role, too.

"Unspeakable Things", linkffn(6473434): Lockhart was DoM special agent Adonis, and he trained Harry/Ginny right from year 2 to be super spies. Both good guys and bad guys were significantly upgraded in this fic.

** I've recently started reading linkao3(California Dreamin' by jenorama)

Harry is an ex-auror turned Defense professor at a school in California, but he can't help but stick his nose into a new mystery involving some political heads in the community. I know people can be wary of American fics, but I think the author does a great job of establishing the wizarding culture there.

Also, Harry and Ginny are already a couple at the beginning of the story, so idk how you feel about that. I will say that I really, really like their portrayal in this fic. They work well off each other, especially as they try to solve the mystery together.

Some downsides: it's a bit over-mugglefied. But at the same time, the author introduces some really interesting magical concepts, and you never forget that it's set in the wizarding world.

Also, there are a few explicit scenes, especially towards the beginning. And there are a lot of OCs, but many of them are very interesting characters.

It's actively updating, and definitely well-written. So, I'd definitely say give it a shot.

** Two of my own on PhoenixSong.

The Sins of the Fathers

In 1879, to repay a debt of honour, Cyriac Weasley promises the hand of the next Weasley girl to be born to the eldest male heir of the Potter family. A reworking of many once-original ideas that have now become clichés in the world of fanfic. This features Slytherin (and super!)Harry, a betrothal contract, redeemed (?) Bella and, of course, Ginny. [[http://www.phoenixsong.net/fanfiction/story/5750/]]

And on the Eighth Day?

It's the final week of Harry's time at Hogwarts and he's looking forward to spending some lazy days by the lake with his girlfriend, Susan Bones. But there's an end of year and end of war celebration to attend and Susan insists on their being involved in the preparation for it. The only fly in the ointment is the Bitch Queen of Slytherin, Ginny Weasley, and the fact that all is not quite what it seems.
