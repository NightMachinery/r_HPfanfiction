Not sure if stuff like this belongs here, but here an idea: You all probably had short, amusing ideas, that you probably couldn't be assed to write for various reasons. Or you want to see a certain short story, but you don't have an idea on how to get this specific scenario to happen.

How about an 'aburd ideas writing challenge'?

Everyone posts one short absurd premise for a story, and then selects an idea posted by someone else and writes a short story about it.

Rules would be the following:

- For every idea you post, you must also post a story based on someone else's idea
- If you start writing a story, indicate it below the comment with the idea, so others can choose a different idea.

It's just a silly little challenge, not a competition, which means there will be no 'winner', other than all of us for taking part in it and reading the results.


** My idea/prompt: Harry is pissed off with Voldemort and everyone else always trying to kill him, so he decides to put a lot of polyjuice-potion based on himself into the watersupply of Hogwarts.

*Daily Prophet*

/Hogwarts Massacre!/

Saint Mungos' Healers are still compiling a casualties after Hogwarts' Potions Master and alleged former Death Eater, Severus Snape, went on a hexing rampage. Sources inside the castle report that a dinner time prank that left most of the student body transfigured to look like Harry Potter, the Boy-Who-Lived, proved to be too much for Professor Snape's sanity. Here at the Daily Prophet we wonder just what Albus Dumbledore, former Chief Warlock and Supreme Mugwump of the ICW, was thinking having a Death Eater on staff in a school with our children? Has senility claimed his mind?

For further information on:

The scandal that led to Dumbledore's removal as Chief Warlock, see page 8.

The "trial" where Severus Snape was found "innocent," see page 5

*Modern Healers Journal*

/Curse Scars and Polyjuice/

Healer Andromeda Tonks (nee Black), who replaced the now infamous Severus Snape as Hogwarts Potions Professor after last week's disastrous polyjuice incident, is seeking volunteers with dark curse scars for a study regarding polyjuice's inability to mimic Harry Potter's famed lightning bolt curse.

*Daily Prophet*

/Defense Professor Sacked!/

Our DMLE is investigating allegations of torture perpetrated by Defense Professor Delores Umbridge after it was discovered by newly hired Professor Tonks that a Blood Quill was being used as punishment in detentions. We at the Daily Prophet would like to know: JUST WHAT IS GOING ON AT THIS SCHOOL!? When questioned about the the hiring practices that led to two professors attacking students, Headmaster Dumbledore would only say that he never hired Delores as she had been appointed to the school under the Ministry's new education reforms. Minister Fudge however blamed the infamous curse upon the DADA professorship for twisting the mind of his previously reliable undersecretary.

*Daily Prophet*

/Ministry worker attacked by snake/

Arthur Weasley, author of the Muggle Protection Act was attacked by a large snake in the ministry building where he had been working late last night. Fortunately his attack was seen by the late Healer Dilis Derwent's Portrait and he was rushed to Saint Mungos where he is listed in critical condition. The DMLE is asking for anyone with any information regarding an escaped magical snake to come forward, but advises anyone who spots one to proceed with extreme caution as it's poison has been magically enhanced.

*Daily Prophet*

/Mass Breakout from Azkaban Prison/

Minister Fudge confirmed for us today that the still at large Sirius Black successfully orchestrated the escape of a number of his cohorts from Azkaban. Eleven high security prisoners, including his cousin Bellatrix Lestrange, arrested for the gruesome torture of Frank and Alice Longbottom, are now loose. The DMLE requests that any sightings of these fugitives be reported immediately, and reminds citizens not to engage them as they should all be assumed to be armed and extremely dangerous.

For a complete listing of the escaped prisoners and their history, see page 3

--------------

*Daily Prophet*

/Death of Philanthropist/

Lucius Malfoy was found murdered in his home today. A DMLE investigator who wished to remain anonymous, revealed that it appeared that he had been forced by his sister-in-law Bellatrix Lestrange (nee Black, sister of Lucius's wife Lady Narcissa Malfoy) to harbor the escapees from Azkaban. Rather than allow them to take refuge in his home, Lucius valiantly gave up his own life setting off a mysterious defensive artifact which filled the manor with a gaseous form of basilisk venom, leaving 13 dead. Narcissa, who was away from home at an emergency Parent/Teacher conference with her other sister, Professor Tonks, could not be reached for comment at this time. We offer our condolences for both her and her son Draco Malfoy, a fifth year student at Hogwarts.

*Daily Prophet*

/Sirius Black found innocent/

An investigation that the DMLE was keeping under wraps just concluded with the most shocking outcome imaginable. Sirius Black, long believed to be the traitor responsible for the death of the Potters, has been found innocent after the investigation at Malfoy Manor revealed that the 13th Death Eater found at the scene was none other than Peter Petigrew who was thought dead after his explosive duel with the same Sirius Black. Veritaserum testimony reveals that it was Petigrew, not Black, who was the Potter's secret keeper and whom led the Dark Lord to their door. Soon after the trial, Sirius Black could be found lambasting the current Ministry administration for what he describes as their outrageous slander of his Godson, Harry James Potter, of whom he is seeking custody. He refused to speak about his ordeal as an innocent man in Azkaban, saying only that he was looking to move on with his life, and to speak to his lawyer Theodore Tonks for any information regarding his case, and that he could neither confirm nor deny any rumors regarding a vote of no confidence being brought against Minister Fudge by the House of Black.

--------------

*Daily Prophet*

/Sirius Black hauled in for questioning regarding Basilisk Bombings/

The Ministry questioned recently exonerated Sirius Black in conjunction with the ongoing search for the identity of the Basilisk Bomber. In an interview shortly after his release from holding, Lord Black expressed concern that newly elected Minister Scrimgeour was falling into the same trap that got his predecessor ejected from office. Lord Black was disheartened to find that even after his exoneration he is still being persecuted by the ministry. The DMLE officials would only say that they had exhaustively cleared Lord Black of any wrongdoings regarding the string of deaths employing veritaserum with Lord Black's permission.

--------------

*Daily Prophet*

/Basilisk Bomber Strikes Again/

It is our sad duty to report the death of Patrocles Nott, the latest in a string of bombings targeting upstanding members of society who were forced to work with He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named via the Imperius Curse. Is it not enough that they were forced to commit atrocities in their youth by the terrible curse? Must they now worry about the misguided actions of a deranged vigilante? The DMLE asks again for anyone with information regarding these bombings to come forward.

--------------

*Daily Prophet*

/The Dark Lord Lives!/

12 of our brave aurors are in Saint Mungos after The Dark Lord stormed the Ministry with his Death Eaters. He was forced to retreat by the heroic actions of the Aurors and Ministry workers, who were tipped off about the attack by Albus Dumbledore. Professor Dumbledore himself dueled He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named in the ministry atrium. When questioned regarding how he knew of the attack the Headmaster offered no comment.

** AU Hermione is a muggleborn parselmouth with no magical relations whatsoever. She gets sorted into slytherin by the hat because she's the "most slytherin individual in centuries" "Blood Purity" was a misinterpretation , it was to mean "untainted/able by dark magic" : moral highground power doesn't corrupt her. Bonus: she might meet someone while he makes a fool of himself hissing in a zoo. - might be nice but found it too clichè

Plot twist: Slytherin is a "mad" scientist-ante litteram , he was a follower of hippocrates (snakes bro) , did several discoveries in healing most of which are public exept one : a charm to "cure" aging [hint : something you know is a RED not-so-herring you get the point]

PS: This has been brewing in my head for AGES , but given the fact i'm not a native english speaker and my time is better invested into studying i never got the opportunity to even plan to write it. Now if anyone will ever bring this plot to light 1) I love you 2) please pm me

"So you think you are the smartest witch to ever step foot in Hogwarts? Surely you'd want to be a Ravenclaw"

"Oh you want to be revolutionise the magical world and bring it into the 21st century? Quite an ambition for someone who has only been aware of the Wizarding world for less than a month."

"Are you sure you want to be in Slytherin? I'm warning you it wont be a smooth a ride for a muggleborn. You might not survive it"

"Yes, you're correct Salazar's house isn't just for purebloods but there hasn't been a muggleborn for at least three decades and for good reason."

"You think you can change their prejudices? You're certainly not a Ravenclaw then."

"If you're planning to try and use snakes to help people and not further yourself I'm going to have to put you in Hufflepuff."

"Yes I suppose you're right, you're not friendly enough to be a Badger. Well there's certainly a lot of bravery in you, wanting to be in Slytherin despite being a muggleborn, maybe I should put you in Gryffindor."

"Not going to settle for other house? Okay I suppose I should wish you the best of luck in SLYTHERIN"

"Draco Malfoy, son of Lucius Malfoy. Granger, I've never heard that name before. Are you from abroad?"

"So you're from England yet I've not heard the name Granger. Who're your parents, muggles?"

"What? A mudblood polluting the noble house of Slytherin!"

"What do you mean bring the wizarding world into the 21st century, we're already in it! Don't answer that I don't care, a mudblood couldn't even change what we have for breakfast here let alone the world."

"What do you mean the world is moving on around us? Why would we want to change? Are you saying that our traditions are worthless?"

"How dare you? Our traditions have been going on for centuries and after being in our world a month you think we should abolish them? I don't care about the muggle filth's technology and if you know what's good for you you'd wouldn't either."

"Get out of my sight Granger, leave your betters alone."

"Oh you don't want to steal the stone, you just want to study it and not use it? You think that makes a difference?"

"Just because I'm the only one you told about it doesn't mean it was me. You could have been followed or overheard, you aren't exactly the most subtle person in the world, you're shouting accusations that I stole a stolen philosopher's stone in the common room without a privacy charm!"

"I don't care if you say you were going to put it back, it's still stealing. Imagine what will happen when Dumbledore finds out that his mentor Nicolas Flamel is going to die because an ignorant mudblood stole it to study and try and make one of her own!"

"You weren't trying to make your own? What were you trying to study it for then?"

"Making a spell to stop ageing? I think you're a little inexperienced to try and create a spell let alone one for immortality. How noble you must feel Granger trying to defeat death only to become a murderer!"

"It doesn't matter if you didn't mean to lose Flamel's stone, he's still going to die because of you. When Dumbledore finds out your wand will be snapped and you'll be sent to Azkaban!"

"Fine! You win come in. Crabbe, Goyle give us a minute would you?"

"What is it that's so important that you had to interrupt my ride home?"

"You've still not found it then?"

"I'll tell you what's going to happen. Nicolas and Perenelle Flamel will die in the near future and you won't say anything. You'll keep your big mouth shut and when you read it in the paper you will act as surprised as everybody else. You owe me big for this. It may even be worth a life debt."

"A life debt? It means you owe me a favour that will either save my life, or cost you yours. You will also have to do things I say when I say."

"Order you around? Yes I can do that and more. You're lucky I'm a kind and generous master and I don't have you doing things for me right now."

"Eurgh, calm yourself Granger I didn't mean those things. We're 12 years old and I would never touch a mudblood!"

"Now that we've had this little conversation I think it's time you left.

*** Hermione was sitting in the library, searching for ways to breath underwater, when the person sitting across of her started twitching like mad. First she thought that maybe he was itching somewhere and trying to get rid of the itch, but the twitching suddenly evolved into violent spasms, and she knew that something was wrong.

„Harry, I don‘t want to get thrown out of the library, so you better... oh my god, Harry, what‘s wrong? Are you getting air? Should I call Madam Pomfrey?“

Harry‘s body was revolting, the muscles on his whole body stretched all the way, way more visible than they normally were. His mouth opened and closed, but no sound escaping, he clearly wasn‘t getting any breath.

Hermione jumped up from her chair, ready to use some spells on Harry or maybe even the Heimlich-manouver, when Harry fell over, hit his head on the chest and suddenly inhaled loudly, before sitting back up abruptly. His pupils, which had started to shrink went back to normal size, and the spasms stopped immediately, as if they never happened.

„Harry, are you alright? What was that?“ Hermione asked, concerned about her friend.

Harry didn‘t react to her at all, instead he suddenly jumped out of his chair and stared at the table in shock. He whirled around a few times, looking at the library as if he had never seen it before, confusion written all over his face.

„What, where... what?“

He continued to twirl around a few more times, and almost hit his face into the edge of the desk when he missed a step and stumbled forward. Even more confusion started to fill his face, mixed with a bit of surprise. He now stared at his shoes as if they were somehow not what he expected to find when looking at his feet. When he tried to touch them with his hands he looked even more lost than before, looking at his hands as if he was on some sort of drug-induced trip.

„Harry?“

Harry jumped at this, as if he hadn‘t noticed another person standing in the room. His eyes fell on Hermione and immediately widened in a mix of shock, surprise, confusion and some other synonyms of basically the same emotion.

„What is... Hermione, is that you?“

„Yes, who else am I supposed to be? Harry, you are starting to scare me, what is going on here?“

Harry now walked towards here, and stared at her, stared at her hair, clothes, the book she was holding and into her eyes. If Harry‘s behaviour hadn‘t been so incredibly creepy, Hermione might have blushed from him staring at her so intensely, but her current reaction was more along the lines of becoming incredibly still, getting goosebumps and almost acting dead.

„But... You look so young?“

Hermione was about to interject that this was unfair, and that she looked fairly mature for her age, when his eyes suddenly started to widen, and his head snapped back to the book in her hand.

„Wait, what? Why are you...“

Without asking Harry grabbed the book and ripped it out of her hand, looked at the title and froze.

„No no no, I know this, why are you reading this? I remember this, why are you reading this? This was during the second trial, wasn‘t it, why are you reading this? No no no, please tell me this is a joke, this can‘t be happening, why are you reading this, WHY ARE YOU READING THIS??!“

Hermione twitched as his voice became louder and louder, more desperate and crazy-sounding with every sentence. Normally she‘d tell him to keep his voice down, they were in a library after all, but she couldn‘t, she was scared. This wasn‘t normal, Harry never acted like this, something was seriously wrong. She slowly started backing away from him, her hand lowering towards her side, ready to grab her wand, only to find it missing. Her eyes jumped over to the table, where her wand was still lying around, which she couldn‘t reach without somehow getting around Harry first.

Harry meanwhile had dropped the book and was grabbing his own hair and pulling it, while frantically looking around, as if searching for something, muttering things below his breath now, not with a raised voice anymore, which still didn‘t make it any less creepy.

„No no no, this can‘t be, why is she reading this, why am I here, why are we here, no, this can‘t be happening, how did this happen, this can‘t be happening, why am I here, why now, I can‘t be here, this can‘t be true, there must be an explanation, she must have a reason for reading this, calm down, there is a rational explanation for all of this, or maybe this is a dream, yes, this must be a dream, must be a dream, a dream, must be a dream, please wake up, wake up, I need to wake up, why am I not waking up...“

Hermione was scared senseless now, not necessarily because Harry was acting aggressive, but rather because something apparently had managed to scare him senseless, something that apparently was still around.

„Harry, please tell me what‘s wrong, I want to help you. Maybe the stress is getting a bit too much, how about we stop searching for today and you get a bit of rest?“

Harry suddenly stopped as if hit into the stomach by something. He turned towards her, and dropped his hands, leaving his hair even more unruly than it usually was, and Hermione gasped as she got a look at his face. He was crying, and his eyes looked broken, so incredibly broken, more hurt than she could even describe.

„...“

„Harry... you‘re crying. Why are you crying?“

„...They‘re gone.“

„What is gone?“

„...Who, not what.“

„I‘m... I‘m sorry, I don‘t understand? Who is gone?“

„My children.“

And with that he fell to his knees and started sobbing desperately, not a silent cry, but a loud and heartbreaking sobbing, the sort where you no longer care about looking dignified to those around you, where the snot starts running and the crying eventually gives you hiccups because you can‘t catch a breath anymore. Harry Potter cried like he never had cried before.

**** Now that's a good portrayal of someone getting thrown back in time. I can't remember ever reading a fic where the person who gets thrown back in time/into an alternate dimension really freaks out. It's always "Welp, I'm a teenager again... time to fix canon and get laid! Not necessarily in that order."

**** no no no, he makes this attempt when he's 12, and still with Pansy. Also, it changes his life because he discovers something he can't do, despite wanting to do it. He ends up with no mustache at all, meanwhile all of Gryfindor grow glorious ones. The twins of course were careful, their potion only grows mustaches on non-Malfoys. When Malfoy drinks one he's polyjuiced into looking like Harry instead.

Edit: The story:

(also avaliable on fanfiction [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11259111/1/Draco-Malfoy-tries-to-grow-a-moustache]])

Draco Malfoy had everything he could ever want, whenever he wanted it.

Draco Malfoy was of good families, and he was, by comparison to his fellows school mates, with which he shared the castle of Hogwarts, of good blood. He felt that that meant that he should be able to do what he wanted to do.

He had never seen his father with the object of his desire, and though his mother side of the family had some epic beards and mustaches, it seemed the proud Malfoy lineage had taken over in genetics, and he wasn't able to grow out a mustache.

He wanted the moustache for one simple reason. Girls dig moustaches, and though he could get in the pants or skirts of most girls in the Slytherin house, or wasn't he a Malfoy, he felt that his sex appeal would increase a lot more if he was somehow able to grow a moustache. Or an epic beard, or ideally a combination of both.

To add to the mockery his best mates (or muscle for hire, which he wasn't actually paying) Crabbe and Goyle had already have a magnificent tuff of hair upon their faces. It was embarrassing for Malfoy to be upstaged by the two taller and beefier boys. Sure they were swimming in testosterone, but they couldn't pull the look.

No, it was up to Malfoy to grow a tuff upon his lips, that with time would turn into a proud string of hairs which he could stroke cordially. They would be blonde. -- He had decided. -- And they would give him the looks that he so desired.

But he couldn't just wait for puberty to do his effects, the 14 year old boy had had grown hairs in his armpits and chest, but those hairs weren't seemingly appearing on his face, instead preferring to grow in the most embarrassing of spots.

But he had a plan, a serious plan, a devious plan, an ingenuous serious devious plan.

He'd just drink the testosterone inducing potion that he knew Professor Snape prepared for himself, when he went to Hogsmeade for companionship. Hey, even a man like the teacher of potions with dubious alliances needed to relieve his urges. Not that Malfoy cared. He'd just steal the potion once the professor was asleep.

He had heard rumors that his lifelong rival and Gryffindor (dork in his opinion) Harry James Potter had an invisibility cloak, that, as the name indicated, made him invisible. Well he had no such things, and he wasn't about to ask his dad, who'd probably just laugh at his reasoning for why he needed a moustache.

His training and teaching was average, but nothing particularly advanced. He was just a normal student. Except in potions, since that was his best discipline. He couldn't do the testosterone potion though, since he didn't have the ingredients.

He tiptoed, trying hard to avoid noise, and Filch. The Slytherin rooms were pretty close to the potions dungeon and if he could only walk the short distance. He would have one moustache just as the ones from the 70's animated images of naked people his dad kept hidden but which he had found.

The testosterone would flow! Draco Malfoy tip toed, carefully, not wanting to be caught by that cat, or her owner.

The truth was, the Draco Malfoy epic moustache would make everyone else jealous of him, he'd be adored by the ladies, he'd be lying himself with different girls so many times that legends would be made about him, that he would become the Hogwarts Casanova, coincidently also a wizard.

Unknown to him, Snape hadn't been preparing the manliness and testosterone potion that month, since he was too busy reminiscing about Lily Evans, a muggle born that he had loved. He got like that sometimes, he enjoyed the physical pleasures but then immediately felt guilty for "bertraying" his darling Lily, even if she had married another.

So when Draco Malfoy finally arrived at the potion's room and found the potion that was on top of the table, not yet purged, then he had no idea that that was the wrong potion, and the effects that potion would have on him.

It wasn't the first time it had happened to him, and it hadn't come from transfiguration this time, but it was still embarrassing, Malfoy felt the familiar touch of his limbs morphing and he knew immediately what was happening. He cursed to himself, it seemed that his vanity had taken over his good senses. Who drank a magical potion that they didn't know about? In the middle of the night?

If anything at least Malfoy had his wish come true , after all, the small creature had a moustache, or, at least, whiskers. Malfoy, the ferret, was back, for a second time.

He would never be taken seriously again.
