Too long, didn't read. Or rather, I tried to read the first few chapters. There are some punctuation and grammar mistakes, but it's just boring. I can see so many redundant words that could be cut to improve the prose.

For example, part of chapter 12 could go from this:

Ron stepped into the abandoned room and immediately noticed a giant ornate mirror in the middle of it. It had clawed feet, and a gold frame that had odd inscriptions carved into it. This is the mirror with Harry's parents... Was he telling the truth? Bloody hell... How do we get them out! Ron stepped out of the cloak and slowly approached the mirror, with Harry quick on his tail.

"See Ron" Harry said, his tone boastful. "My parents are in there! C'mon have a look!" Harry said as he overtook Ron and jumped in front of the mirror. Harry looked hungrily at the reflection in the mirror, while Ron stood just a little behind Harry. All Ron could see was Harry, but it was clear to Ron that Harry saw much more as the boy-who-lived had tears welling up in his eyes.

"Harry..." Ron said softly, making Harry turn and face him. "Harry, I don't see your parents in there... just you." Harry looked at Ron in bewilderment, and then Harry shook his head hard.

"No Ron, they're right there! I can see them!" Harry implored, his voice was strained. "Come here" Harry said quickly as he pulled Ron into the spot that Harry was just now occupying, right in front of the mirror. "Ok, now look into the mirror..." Ron gave Harry a quick smile, though Ron felt quite sad at seeing Harry so desperate for something. Ron then turned and looked into the mirror. What he saw within brought tears into his eyes, and a terribly sad smile upon his lips.

Ron's reflection was surrounded by his loved ones, and his loved ones were all older than they were now. Fred was standing right behind Ron, alive and happy, and he had his arm draped around Ron's shoulders. Around them were the members of the Weasley and Lovegood families, all of them were beaming at Ron. They looked so happy, so content, and so full of life. Ron felt his own hands tremble slightly and he gave a wet chuckle at the sight. /They're all alive, and unharmed... Fred is alive! I did it!/

To this:

Ron stepped into the abandoned room and noticed a giant mirror with clawed feet and a gold frame. The top was covered in odd inscriptions.

This is the mirror with Harry's parents. Was he telling the truth? Bloody hell... How do we get them out? Ron stepped out of the cloak and slowly approached the centre of the room with Harry quick on his tail.

"See Ron," boasted Harry, "my parents are in there! C'mon, have a look!" Harry jumped in front of the mirror, looking hungrily at his reflection while Ron stood behind. All he could see was Harry, but it was clear to him that Harry saw much more.

"Harry..." Ron began softly, making Harry turn and face him. "Harry, I don't see your parents in there... just you."

Harry looked at Ron in bewilderment, tears falling. "No Ron, they're right there! I can see them!"

"Come here," Harry said, pulling Ron in front of the mirror. "Ok, now look into the mirror..." Ron gave Harry a quick smile, though Ron felt quite sad seeing him so desperate for something. He turned and looked into the mirror.

Ron's reflection was surrounded by his older loved ones. Fred was standing right behind him, alive and happy, his arm draped around Ron's shoulders. The rest of the Weasley and Lovegood families surrounded them, beaming. They looked so full of life. Ron felt his eyes water and he let out a wet chuckle. /They're all alive, and unharmed! Fred is alive! I did it!/

Not perfect but a bit better. Little changes here and there can really help trim the fat.

The word count is another factor. 2.5 /million/ words and it's only completed up to third year? Maybe if I read from the beginning it'd be easier. I really want to enjoy this fic but it's just too much.
