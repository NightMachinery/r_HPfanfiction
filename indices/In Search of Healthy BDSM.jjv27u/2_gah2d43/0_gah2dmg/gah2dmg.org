  Friends. If they were asked to describe their relationship in one word, they would pick friends. Lovers. Soulmates. Deeply damaged people who had somehow found redemption in each other. They were all of that, and much more. But they had always been, and always would be Friends.Post-War. No bashing. Harmony.Disclaimer: I do not own any of the characters, nor am I aiming to profit off of this story. This is simply a tribute to one of my favourite ships in one of my favourite fandoms!
