#+begin_quote
  Harry has been entered into the Triwizard Tournament against his will, and his friends don't believe him when he insists he didn't enter his name. Will Ginny Weasley sit by and watch him suffer alone, or will she risk exposing the dark secret she has been hiding. GoF re-write from Ginny's POV. Smart & slightly manipulative Ginny! Extreme Ron-bashing!
