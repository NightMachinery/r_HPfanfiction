  Rose Potter spent twenty-one years as the Chosen One. Reborn as Harry Potter's twin, he alone has the scar after that Samhain night. Harry knows there's something odd about his sister - she's too old, too mature, and knows far too many things she shouldn't - but he loves her anyway. He's been there for her ever since they were born, so Rose'll be damned if she lets history repeat itself.(In her past life, Hogwarts didn't unite until the very end and everyone suffered for it) (Lily Potter was willing to do anything and sacrifice everything for the safety of her family. Rose intended to do nothing less)In which not all Slytherins are evil, not all Gryffindors are good, and the Wizarding World is more than just an extension of the Muggle one.Years 1-3
