  Harry wakes up in a strange jungle seemingly de-aged and without his wand. He has to figure out how to live in this whole new environment that he has seemingly warped to. And what the hell is a Wakanda? First few chapters will be about entry into the world and not much else. Obviously takes place in the Avengers universe. Will primarily use the MCU as a reference.

  Harry finds a dying ashen haired girl in his backyard being attacked by men in skeleton armor. He obviously swoops in and kills them saving the girl before taking her to his home to heal her. He didn't know the far reaching consequences this would have on him personally. This will start in Harry Potter world but ultimately take place in the Witcher for the most part.

  Harry Potter is done with life. He did everything and all he wanted was to pass on to the next great adventure. Sadly, rules get in the way of this and he must now find a new way to keep living. It's not all bad though. At least he gets another chance to live life his way and on his terms. Warning: Mentions of attempted suicide and other stuff to come.
