  Even muggles notice thousands dead, and Margaret Thatcher had the help of one Sergeant Prewett of Her Majesty's Special Air Service. Harry Potter is taken in by a loving family, and raised to become the hero of both worlds. Even as he enters Hogwarts looking for friends, he is confronted by the darkness in the wizarding world. First year complete, second year starting April 2017.
