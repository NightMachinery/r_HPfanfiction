  What if Voldemort had chosen the pureblood boy, not the halfblood, as his opponent? This Neville would have had graves to visit, instead of a hospital. He'd still have grown up in his grandmother's clutches, tut-tutted at, dropped out windows absentmindedly, left to bounce on paving stones.Let's tell this story: Alice Longbottom, who was the better at hexing, told Frank to take Neville and run.
