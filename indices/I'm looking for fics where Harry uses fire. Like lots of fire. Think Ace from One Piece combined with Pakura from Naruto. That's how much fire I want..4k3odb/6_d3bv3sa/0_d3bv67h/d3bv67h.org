  New Mexico was not the first time Thor had been a mortal. It was only a refinement of the technique. What if James Potter had been Thor, incarnated as a memoryless newborn? On his death, Odin removed his memories as James, due to grief. In Harry's Third Year, a (mostly) reformed Loki restores them. Harry now has a father, a family and a heritage that is going to change the world.
