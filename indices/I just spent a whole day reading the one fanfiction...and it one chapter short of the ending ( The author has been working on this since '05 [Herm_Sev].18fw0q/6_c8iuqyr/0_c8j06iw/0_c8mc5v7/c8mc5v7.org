Haha Ok, so with a little bit of searching the subreddit, I found a few good lists of recommendations. You'll probably have heard of a few of these already but I'm going to give yet another list :) I never read one-shots so most of these are at least novella length all the way up to 600,00 words. Some of them are decent, some are fantastic, and I'm going to include ones that have gotten good reviews even though I don't particularly like them (because everyone has different tastes!) The only fics I won't recommend on purpose are "Time Turner" fics. Mostly because I haven't read any, although there are some very popular ones.

For somewhat smutty, darker fun: [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5041998/1/Out-of-the-Depths][Out Of the Depths]] This story can get pretty kinky at times. It features a 19 year old Hermione returning to school and discovering that she doesn't feel quite the same way about being a student...or about Severus.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3814832/1/Care-of-Magical-Creatures][Care of Magical Creatures]] This was my first exposure to SS/HG, and coincidentally, my favorite until I stumbled across Pet Project. I enjoyed the character development almost the whole way through, although this Snape seems to really love curse words. It's fairly smutty too, but about halfway through the characters seem to remember that there's a war going on and they get down to actual business.

[[http://www.themasque.net/wiktt/efiction/viewstory.php?sid=2054&ageconsent=ok&warning=5][Learning to Love]] You'll need an account on WIKTT (if you don't have one already, or don't know what WIKKT is, it's a good source for SS/HG fanfictions that aren't on FF.net) in order to view this one. It's VERY unfinished, but true to the characters and interesting. Like Care of Magical Creatures, it's a "marriage law" fic.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/834017/1/The_Buried_Life][The Buried Life]] This fic is kind of weird. It's a bit fluffy, likes to show off neat magical concepts, and throws Severus and Hermione together in an interesting way. This love story is relatively short and simple and doesn't ignore the consequences of falling for one another-they undergo a necessary separation. Rated M but it's not very smutty.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7413926/40/Chasing_The_Sun][Chasing the Sun]] Read it. Read it. Read it. Just do it. Rated M, well-written and unfinished, probably one of the best fics after Pet Project.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6010521/1/Semantics][Semantics]] Okay so I'm split on how I feel about this one. On one hand, I think it's pretty brilliant and original. On the other hand, it's loooong and the characters exist primarily in the muggle world so it naturally presents our heros and heroines as...different than usual. Definitely worth a read, but can get a little dry at times. Rated T so no explicit sexy times.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4661762/1/The-Gilded-Cage][The Gilded Cage]] I've never read a fic quite like this one- it's a twist on the classic Marriage Law Challenge. Snape in prison, Hermione as a fierce career woman, strange discussions and smexy times in a prison cell. I loved it, but it's definitely not for everyone. If you want to stick to strictly Hogwarts grounds and younger Hermione, this is not for you.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7548835/1/30-days][30 Days]] Lawdy, Lawdy, where to begin with this one? I hated the ending. HOWEVER. It is...a story that will stick with you. It's unusual for a fanfiction in the sense that it's narrated in first person; after you get used to it though, it's very gripping. Also mentally scarring. It's about Hermione and Snape, trapped in a dungeon for 30 days, and the horrible psychological traumas of being unsure of one's fate.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4636103/1/All-I-Have-to-Do][All I Have to Do]] This is one I recommend based on the amount of attention it's gotten, and not for personal reasons. Rated M. It's about Hermione carrying Snape's child- and it gets really weird (the name of the child is just..strange...if I remember correctly, it's named after a goblin). But some people really like the whole Snape+Hermione=Babies idea and this is one of the ones I've read that wasn't /completely/ atrocious. I'm a little biased against children.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4161096/1/Polyandry-and-Other-Problems][Polyandry and Other Problems]] This...I don't think I ever finished it. The writing wasn't horrible though, and it got a fair amount of reviews. This is a nod to those who love polyandry and Lucius Malfoy. Definitely OOC at times, and Rated M for a reason.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4814128/1/For-the-Potions-Master-s-Amusement][For the Potion Master's Amusement]] I hated this fic, it made Hermione seem way submissive and it rubbed against some of my personal values. However, it's gotten lots of reviews and is mildly popular as far as I can tell. Lots'o'smut and VERY kinky.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5499683/1/The-Seven-Year-Wait][The Seven Year Wait]] I don't have much to say for this fic, I think it's just one of those that feel essential to the SS/HG fandom, although I can't say it sticks out above the best of the bunch. Rated M

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4776976/1/The-Problem-with-Purity][The Problem with Purity]] At a whopping 638,037 words, this is no short or simple fic- this one takes dedication and time. Don't enter if you don't like OOC, this one takes Harry Potter all over the map and introduces a whole new magical concept of power being increased through purity. It's crazy but well written, and though I didn't /always/ like it, I think it's still worth the time.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1798225/25/A-Law-to-Herself][A Law to Herself]] This one is well-written and awesome (it's tagline is great: "Wikkt marriage challenge: In which we break all the rules"), but it hasn't been updated in 5 years... Read at your own discretion.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6578435/1/Post-Tenebras-Lux][Post Tenebras, Lux]] Hermione runs into Snape ten years after the Final Battle- EVERYTHING is supposedly canon except, well, the plot of this story, and Snape's survival of the battle. Rated M. Great read.

Teen rated, generally fluffier things: [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1215092/3/Heart-over-Mind][Heart Over Mind]] This is a cool concept- Hermione takes a love potion that leaves her completely unaffected because of an interesting and kind of sappy twist (although the author pokes fun at the concept) . It's not my favorite, but it's pretty good. This fic is set mostly post-Hogwarts, although the first part of it features Hermione as a student. The romance is long in coming and you'll get to meet a whole host of OC's when she goes to college...and South America. Not your usual HG/SS but a decent read.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3830889/20/Looking-For-Love][Looking for Love]] Okay, a word of warning about this one, the characterization is pretty sad. Ive read it a few times and I like it more each time I try it out, but I can't remember liking it the first time around. It's...just...goofy. Features a weird eroctic-ish scene with naked Hermione and^{toddler^{Snape}}\\
I'll leave you with that.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1584875/5/The-First-Faint-Glimmer][The First Faint Glimmer]] Snape spends christmas with the Grangers. Good for a read if you have time or feel lighthearted. I'm pretty sure Hermione likes David Bowie music a lot in the fic (not really relevant, but something that stuck out to me as interesting) and you get to see Hermione's home life and experience awkward interactions between the Granger parents and Snape. Rated T.

Alright folks, hopes that's a good start. I noticed that some of my reviews seem negative, but I think most well-written fanfics are worth reading to develop deeper appreciation and new ways of looking at the fandom. I have a lot more rec's if you find one you like and want ones that are similar- but right now I have a bottle of Apple vodka and a good movie calling my name. Edit: Formatting and a word
