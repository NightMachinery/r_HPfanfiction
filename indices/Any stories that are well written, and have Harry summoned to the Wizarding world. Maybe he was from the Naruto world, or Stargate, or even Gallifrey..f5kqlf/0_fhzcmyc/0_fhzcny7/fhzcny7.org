#+begin_quote
  Sequel to Fate's Gamble. Harry has finished with his original world (aside from a few visits) and now it's time to follow through on his promise to Fate to set right another world that her meddling didn't have quite the same effect as in his own. Summoned to fight Voldemort once more, Harry decides to have some fun while he's there. This is fan fiction, I only own the plot.
