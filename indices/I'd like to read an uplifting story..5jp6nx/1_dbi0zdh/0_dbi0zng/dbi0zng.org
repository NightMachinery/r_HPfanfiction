[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/12148666/1/][*/The Secret Diary of Hugo Granger-Weasley, Aged Thirteen and a Half/*]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/6993240/FloreatCastellum][/FloreatCastellum/]]

  Rose says that I am an oblivious moron, but would an oblivious moron have such a deep and sensitive diary? I don't think so. No one knows how I suffer in this ridiculous family. Written for SIYE's The Burrow Secret Challenge 2016, and inspired by Sue Townsend's Adrian Mole.
