  Harry doesn't mind that so many Slytherins from his year have returned to finish their NEWTs, really he doesn't. It's just -- do they have to be so friendly? He's not prejudiced, really he's not. It's just -- they've got to be up to something, right? Unnerved by the attention he's attracting from everyone -- the Slytherins are the least of it, to be fair -- and struggling with a raft of changes to Hogwarts itself, Harry wishes he could be happy that one constant remains: Draco Malfoy really fucking hates him.When he's hit by an illegal love-spell though, Harry finds he has more to worry about than whether or not Blaise Zabini actually wants to be his friend. For if everyone affected has been blessed -- or cursed, by the look on Malfoy's face -- with a magical tattoo revealing the name of their soulmate, what does it mean that Harry's skin remains completely bare?
