  The first thing everyone noticed about Hope Potter was that she may have had her mother's face, but she had her father's penchant for causing trouble or somehow finding it, and it only made sense that danger was attracted to her very scent. She was going to prove she was more than just the Girl-Who-Lived. (Fem!Harry) Mostly canon-compliant, diverging in book eight
