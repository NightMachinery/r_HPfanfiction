#+begin_quote
  Regulus agrees to be a spy for the Order of the Phoenix shortly before Voldemort's downfall. Thirteen years later, he's a reluctant potions master under the watchful eye of Albus Dumbledore, just trying to get through his days without cursing the meddling Headmaster. Now Regulus's estranged brother has escaped from Azkaban, and Dumbledore has had the grand idea to invite Sirius's pet werewolf to teach at the school.
