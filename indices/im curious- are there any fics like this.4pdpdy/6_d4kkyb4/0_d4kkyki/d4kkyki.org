#+begin_quote
  The Hog's Head is an unabashed romance that follows the lives of Harry and Ginny from the Battle of Hogwarts through the following year. Chapter One, "Faith," begins during the Battle as Lord Voldemort calls his truce. It follows canon precisely but from Ginny's point of view. My own plot, post-DH, begins with Chapter Two, "Anticipation."
