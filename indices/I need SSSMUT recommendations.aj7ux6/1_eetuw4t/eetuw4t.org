This one has a few chapters with some pretty good detailed stuff happening, and it's otherwise a very well plotted story. It's actually one of my favorites, which is ironic, because the pairing initially made my head want to explode, but Star Girl totally made it work!

Ten years after Voldemort's demise, Severus Snape, thought by all to be dead, lives out his days in solitude. Ginny Potter, meanwhile, juggles a high-profile career, three children and a workaholic husband. What happens to change their lives forever?

Also you may like this one too, has some nice smutty scenes with Snape and Lily:

Lily and Severus reconcile after her marriage to James, beginning an affair that will have long-lasting consequences. Canon compliant until "The Half-Blood Prince". Eventual Severitus.

​

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/555858/Heatherlly][Heatherlly]] has two more Snape stories, which I haven't read yet, but they're next on my list, and since they're both rated M, I suspect they may also fulfill your requirements, but can't confirm.
