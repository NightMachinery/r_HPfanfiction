  Instead of letting Vernon in on her sister's little secret, Petunia worked diligently to keep magic as nothing more than a fairytale. However, when she dies unexpectedly, leaving her husband a widower shortly before that fateful Halloween night, Vernon doesn't know what he's getting himself into when he takes Harry into his home. AU. COMPLETE with epilogue!
