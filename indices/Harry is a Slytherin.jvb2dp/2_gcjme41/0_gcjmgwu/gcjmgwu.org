  After ten years of misery with the Dursleys, Harry Potter learns that he has magic. Except, in this story, it's not a surprise-the only surprise is that there are others like him. Including his twin brother, Julian Potter, the savior of the Wizarding world. This isn't the Harry you think you know.

  AU: Voldemort had no idea what she was starting when she attacked the Potters on Halloween night. Not only did she create a living legend in Charlus Potter, The Boy Who Lived, but she touched the life of another just as deeply. Harry Potter grew up abused and alone and unlike his brother, he quickly had to learn to fend for himself. Abuse changes people on both a physical and psychological level, so when Harry Potter showed up at Hogwarts just a little bit different to how people may have expected, they really ought not to have been surprised. They should not have asked themselves what had happened, they should have asked themselves what would possibly happen next. WBWL, Slytherin Harry, Fem Voldemort, Grey Harry.
