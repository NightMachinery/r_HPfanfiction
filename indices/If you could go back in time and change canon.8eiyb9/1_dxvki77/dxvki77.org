Some of Half Blood Prince (to prelude the changes) and pretty much all of The Deathly Hallows.

I would remove the Hallows completely. I would make the hunt for the Horcruxes a journey into the depths of magic instead, bringing the abilities of all three to the limit. I would include the Order into this endeavor.

Personally, I would have also put Harry and Hermione together (starting in HBP and ending with a scene after the battle), but thats just pairing preference.
