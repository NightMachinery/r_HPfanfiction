Matou Shinji Series: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10918531/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Philosopher-s-Stone][Matou Shinji and the Philosopher's Stone]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10918531/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Heirs-of-Slytherin][Matou Shinji and the Heirs of Slytherin]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11407944/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Master-of-Death][Matou Shinji and the Master of Death]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11686212/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Broken-Chains][Matou Shinji and the Broken Chains]] - It's a crossover between Harry Potter, Nasuverse, and the Assassins Creed, but it doesn't require knowledge of either. Matou Shinji, the protagonist, is unable to become magus and that makes him a failure to his family. He would completely break, but he gets a letter from Hogwarts. Wanting praise and attention he focuses on giving his best to succeed at witchcraft. Will he obtain what he seeks? What will come with his friendship with Boy-Who-Lives? And why Hogwarts? Featuring two Voldemorts, rapist tanuki, Draco Malfoy working part-time at Saint Mungo and assassin creating elite school club. Nice blend of obscure elements of both settings with author's original ideas. Features Mahoutokoro, Durmstrang, and original magical school. Ongoing, with currently irregular updates.
