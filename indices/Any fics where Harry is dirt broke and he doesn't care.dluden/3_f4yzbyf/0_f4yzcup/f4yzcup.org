#+begin_quote
  Harry James Potter, Boy-Who-Lived, Chosen One, etc. is a squib with no knowledge of the magical world. By general consensus, he is most useful as potions ingredients. General consensus being unanimous agreement by everyone except one Harry James Potter. But who cares about his opinion anyway?(aka: Harry is having a good day, until the part where he gets teleported into a creepy graveyard with some even creepier... cult members?)
