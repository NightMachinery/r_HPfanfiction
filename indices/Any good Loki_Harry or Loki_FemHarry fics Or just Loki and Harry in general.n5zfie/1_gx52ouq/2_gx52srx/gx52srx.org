  He only ever wanted to bring Sirius back, but in Harry's life nothing ever goes the way he wants it to.

  Harry's soulmark words are not written in English. Loki's are. It makes things complicated for both of them. And it means a lot of waiting.

  Many years have passed since the great battle of Hogwarts, and Harry's life has only gotten worse. Of course, he had imagined that after the battle ended, everything would go back to normal; at least, as normal as possible. But it wasn't long until the Ministry was taken over by yet more evil, dark, corrupt wizards. Wizards who wanted Harry out of the picture. After a series of unfortunate events, Harry is left on the run. Running from both the ministry and himself, it seemed. He has nowhere to go, and year after year passes by. He doesn't want to live like this anymore. He wants something better for himself; he wants the life that he once had. Being compared to Voldemort takes it's toll though, and the wizarding world no longer looks upon the boy who lived with wonder. They look upon him with disgust, with suspicious eyes and wands at the ready. He is an outcast in the only place he could call home. Stories about him are riddled with evil and lies, being passed down from generation to generation. But it all changes when a storm above London, England, at 9:46 am on August 13th, brings an outsider to earth, a powerful sorcerer with shoulder length black hair and and charming yet somehow malicious smile.

  Harry turned his head back to his Starkpad and flipped to the next page. Quite happily, to himself he said, "Not my circus, not my monkeys." Whether it was a meteor or a piece of an airplane, it mattered nothing. "The Boy Who Lived is in retirement." He shifted in his hammock, moving to a more comfortable position, and looked up just in time to watch the object fall into his vegetable garden. Harry stifled a strangled sound as he surveyed the damage. What had once been the center of his vegetable garden was a crater more than a meter in diameter. The vegetables that he'd planted were gone. Left behind was a single hammer.

  Harry only wanted to get the greasiest burger he could find and relax for a few hours. He had just got off his latest assignment, so he had earned at least that much of a break, right? Wrong. Death was a slave driver. Master of Death? Most misleading title ever created.

  (Or - The Time MoD!Harry Got Fed Up and Dealt With Loki Himself, to the Consternation and Confusion of Everyone Else.) Some days, dealing with a bunch of bratty quasi-immortal beings and their temper tantrums just wasn't worth it. Especially when they kept causing him so much extra paperwork.
