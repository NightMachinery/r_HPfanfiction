  Crazy idea. What if Harry was Tony's dad?Not in a million years would Harry thought that by letting Anthony be held for a moment by a woman whom just lost her baby, would let the press go wild. In under an hour, the whole city knew about his baby. And under a couple of hours so did the whole United States of America. And soon the whole world would know. The worst thing was that they thought Anthony was the Stark heir.This work is a slow burn. So basically it will cover Tony as a baby, kid, teen, young man 'till adult. And mostly i used Howard, Harry, and Tony's POVPs. This work is 70% marvel and 30% Harpot world. And neither marvel or harpot charactrs are mine, but most of the story ideas are mine. So hope u enjoy reading itCOMPLETED

  There was a bruise on his cheekbone and one decorating his left eye, and his nose had traces of dried blood running down to his chin, and he had a split lip. But his hands, his knuckles, were red and raw, and that's what made Steve approach the boy standing on the street corner. [COMPLETE]

  Thanos has come close to death more than once. He saw a being who fascinated him. Death is a man of great beauty with the most captivating green eyes. Thanos will try everything to see him again and especially to seduce him. He therefore thinks that destroying worlds will bring him the favors of the Master of Death. Harry is the intermediary between the world of the dead and Hellfeim where a goddess helps maintain peace and balance. The more Thanos kills, the more angry Harry gets. His limit is reached when he attacks the planet under his protection, the Earth. Thanos is going to drool. He doesn't know what will fall on him. Harry Potter is more than a God.All rights go to the amazing author - memepotter952504.
