  Professor Umbridge seized Marietta, pulled her around to face her, and began shaking her very hard. A split second later Dumbledore was on his feet, his wand raised. Kingsley started forward and Umbridge leapt back from Marietta, waving her hands in the air as though they had been burned.

  “I cannot allow you to manhandle my students, Dolores,” said Dumbledore, and for the first time, he looked angry.

  “You want to calm yourself, */Madam Umbridge/*,” said Kingsley in his deep, slow voice. “You don't want to get yourself into trouble now.”

  “No,” said Umbridge breathlessly, glancing up at the towering figure of Kingsley. “I mean, yes --- you're right, Shacklebolt --- I --- I forgot myself.”
