Given the postwar information, I can derive a much much darker interpretation of what they had become 20 years later (The DA could become the acronym for 'Dark Army').

I think their generation was completely fed up by the failures of their predecessors, and wanted to do things THEIR WAY. Core DA members had to come to an understanding after the War, that things in Magical Britain were no longer sustainable and revolutionary changes had to take place. This mindset provided the ideological underpinning of their movements, which centered around Hermione and Harry.

I don't think they would just become your average politicians, but ruthless revolutionaries who displayed almost perfect public image (model families, modest living). They ran on great sounding platforms (equality, justice, love, peace, and prosperity), had hordes of hardcore followers (DA, Quidditch fans, Hogwarts graduates, werewolves, fanboys/girls), turned the military/police (the DMLE) into their private army, became filthy rich (confiscated Death Eater wealth, memory charmed Muggles, Weasley owned businesses, royalties from their 'heroic deeds'), dominated the public media (Ginny was the real force behind The Daily Prophet, Luna owned the next largest publication), were utterly ruthless to their enemies (real and perceived), and most importantly, firmly believed what they were doing was right and necessary to protect their 'loved ones'.

Threats to their power base would have unfortunate accidents or die in embarrassing ways (what? he had a heart attack while engaging in autoerotic asphyxiation? oh dear...), or even accidentally blow themselves up while attempting dark rituals. People who opposed them politically would have their positions undercut through media and rumors. Some pain in the ass would be taken care of by street violence, such as an angry mob demanding the head of that 'Slanderous Skeeter'. Meanwhile, Hermione would be the calm, thoughtful, considerate leader who seemed really nice, while Harry would be the brave, energetic, and powerful hero who kept everyone safe.

I can very well imagine the following conversation: "Yes, it really is necessary, and I prepared this 400 page document that makes it all clear, so you go read it and come back if there's anything you don't understand, and we'll have a lovely talk about it." (person leaves) "Harry, I want that arse investigated so hard it scours his floors. Find something, and if you can't find something, make something up. Perhaps plant some naughty ideas in his head first."

These people would eat Frank Underwood for breakfast.

Since they made it to the top after 20 years, I guess the new story will be a mixture of "CSI", "Homeland", and "House of Cards". I thought about the "West Wing", but the politics in magical Britain were a lot dirtier and the struggles a lot deadlier. Probably JKR was probably right in not writing more, because there would be no way our heroes could avoid doing lots of nefarious things or 'necessary evil'. Politics and power struggles are inherently ugly, just following JKR on Twitter will give you an idea how much mud is being sling around, and she's not even fighting for control or engaged in personal life and death struggles.
