  -BOOK 1/7. COMPLETE. Structured like original HP books. Series to be concluded in summer 2015!- Albus starts at Hogwarts! The world is in tumult over a vital question: in the age of technology, should Muggles be informed of magic now before they find out anyway? But there are more problems (see long summary inside). And Albus is right in the center of them all.
