#+begin_quote
  In a conversation with Dumbledore's portrait after the battle at Hogwarts, Harry finds out that he is and always has been a homunculus---a substitute body made to carry the Horcrux so that little Harry Potter, who lies asleep as a baby under powerful charms, wouldn't have to. Harry struggles to process the news, the fallout, and the discovery that he might disintegrate at any moment.
