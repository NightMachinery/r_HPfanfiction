I have stated this before, but I will reiterate my previous statement:

The point and House system is essentially a way of psychologically conditioning the student population of Hogwarts to:

1. Obey the rules, you are rewarded. Break the rules, you lose points, this hurts your house.
2. Do well in class, learn magic, act the way the teacher wants/expects during class, you gain points.
3. Compel students to excel in academic and extracurricular activities (i.e. quidditch, possibly other clubs and organizations) without asking them.
4. Encourage the other members of each house to ostracize anyone who costs them in these activities, hurts their house's image, or loses points for whatever reason. This requires less participation on the teachers part and compels the students as they grow to behave in the way they /think/ everyone else in their house should. This is why so many of them end up gravitating towards each house stereotype.

The gist of this is that the system is much like the modern public school model, i.e. go to class for an hour, bell rings, rotate position, repeat. In the 19th century, this was designed to create factory workers. Hogwarts system is designed to compel good behavior and academic excelling. It has a specific purpose beyond the pale.

Additionally, the point system allows the teachers to manage a student body that outnumbers them more than 50 to 1. They can't give out detention for every transgression - their aren't enough teachers - and corporal punishment is no longer tolerated at Hogwarts since the 1950s.

The system is designed to create obedient citizens, where the population naturally seeks to not appear different from their social group (i.e. Houses) and for the students to discipline one another to compel obedience. They naturally carry these tendencies into the greater world once they leave school.

But that makes sense, just like it did with the boarding schools in Europe Rowling based Hogwarts off of.

Hogwarts was founded before the Ministry, before any form of magical government really. There effectively were no real laws on magicals, with the declarations of kings and feudal lords being irrelevant to even low-skilled wizards/witches. This system /indoctrinates/ graduates into being upstanding citizens and trying to appear normal: if someone commits a crime, the rest of the magical world in Britain will ostracize them and treat them as pariahs. Its rather Orwellian in its nature actually.
