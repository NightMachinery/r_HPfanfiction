Matou Shinji, protagonist, is unable to become magus and that makes him failure to his family. He would completely break, but he gets letter from Hogwarts. Wanting praise and attention he focus on giving his best to succeed at witchcraft. Will he obtain what he seeks? What will come with his friendship with Boy-Who-Lives? And why Hogwarts? Featuring two Voldemorts, rapist tanuki, Draco Malfoy working part-time at Saint Mungo and assassin creating elite school club. Nice blend of obscure elements or both settings with author original ideas. Ongoing, with currently iregular updates.

Shinji's use of stuff from the room even leads to creation of a new school rule.
