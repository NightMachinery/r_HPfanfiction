[[https://www.stormfront.org/forum/t760706/][I decided to google this. You know what the first link that comes up when you google "non-white Harry Potter"? A link to stormfront explaining why Harry Potter is "poison for white kids" Enjoy the read.]]

  Which notable characters are women and not in roles that a 1950s advertisement would be happy with?
#+end_quote

...Petunia and Mrs Weasley are the only two who fit that ideal and both seem perfectly fine with it. Nothing wrong with a house wife. In fact even Mrs Weasley barely fits that.

  Homosexuality? There are bare hints of it, easily ignored

The 3 main characters are straight and they are the only characters we really see relationships of. You could make the same argument about any random attribute that affects 5-10% of the public.

The reason Harry Potter doesn't make a big deal out of minorities is because it created its own in mudbloods and purebloods. The morals and lessons of this "bloodism" can be applied to any prejudice which is /the whole point/. Kids will read it and hopefully see their own prejudices in it and adding specific real-world scenarios into it will only dilute that message.
