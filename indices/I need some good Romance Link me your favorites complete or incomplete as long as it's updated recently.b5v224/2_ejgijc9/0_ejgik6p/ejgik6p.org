#+begin_quote
  Book 1 of a Trilogy. Harry Potter thought his life could not get any worse. No parents, the worst childhood one could ever imagine, and now no godfather. Harry Potter was wrong. When his name comes out of The Goblet of Fire, Harry is abandoned by those closest to him, and is sure that he is truly and completely alone. Once again, Harry Potter was wrong.
