  Latin; a dead language with no practical applications except perhaps the deciphering of old texts and as a particularly quaint party trick. Thankfully, as Harry finds out, Latin is not as dead as he was first taught when he decided to learn the language. It wouldn't have mattered anyway, of course; he loved Latin, and would have been proud to know it even had it been as useless as it was pretty. But in the world of Wizards, the world of Magic, Harry realizes his rare talent with words is particularly valuable, and allows him to use magic that no one's ever heard of, and no one's ever seen, even if he must keep it secret for his own safety.But there are secrets beyond those Harry is keeping, secrets that run deeper than the first stones that were laid down to create Hogwarts, and as Harry uncovers more and more of what he can do, he starts to realize just how deep the magical rabbit hole goes.It's not that he's going Dark, after all. It's just that he never understood what that really meant, and he always was a little too curious for his own good.
