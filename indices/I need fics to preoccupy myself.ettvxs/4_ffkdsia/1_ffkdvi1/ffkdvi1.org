  Usually it is someone highly intelligent that travels back in time -- even Harry is only suppressing his brilliance. But Ron? Hard-working, quick, open-minded... He is not. But with years of advantage over his peers even he can become something more than a tired Auror with a wife that hates him. Amoral!Sly!Ron.
