When it comes to "lethal" spells, I don't think it's as cut and dry as you make it out to be.

"However, as a small aside, another aspect people always fail to consider is stopping power. People always love to laugh at stunners because of its non-lethality and its countercharm. However, I think stunners are actually one of the better spells in one's repertoire. Take diffindo or sectumsempra. Authors will have their characters use cutting spells instead of stunners. Let's examine the combat capabilities of each spell.

Stunners instantly put down their target. Full stop. They can be added together to become more lethal. One you are hit, you're out of the battle. You're vulnerable to a follow-up spell. It can also be used to halt objects.

Sectumsempra and diffindo are variable. People can easily survive stab and slash wounds and remain conscious from them. Stopping power is lacking compared to the stunning spell though a lucky hit may render a target incapable of fighting.

People can be revived from stunning spells. It's interesting to note that it still takes a while for them to be combat capable once more. However, once stunned, one cannot wake themselves up, leaving one vulnerable to coup de grace). People can be healed from cutting charms with episkey and the counter to sectumsempra. /Because of its lack of stopping power, one can heal oneself of their cut/.

Both spells can be shielded against, blocked, and repelled.

In conclusion, a stunner is better for actually rendering an opponent non-combative. One of the better examples is George Weasley. A sectumsempra that takes off an ear would have killed him had it been a stunner (the fall). Draco Malfoy remains conscious and moving (combat-capable) after being hit with a sectumsempra.

This type of thinking applies to the spells used elsewhere in fics. Blood-boilers, bone breakers, ice spears, etc all lack the stopping power and effectiveness of stunners. The order didn't shy away from killing but neither did they shy away from using more effective curses. The only spells I consider more combat-effective in canon are the killing curse (though this has the drawback of a hefty power requirement - Harry likely can't use it for a majority of his school years) and Dolohov's unnamed curse. And most authors don't even use Dolohov's spell."

In this comment I quoted, I only talked about spells. I disagree with you on animations and transfigurations, I think they add a lot of versatility and ability to fights. Your opponent hiding in a room behind a shield? Conjure, animate, and disillusion.

I do agree with you on writing fights though.
