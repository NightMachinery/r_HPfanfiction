  Harry gets sent back in time and across dimensions because... well, there doesn't really seem to be a reason why. Life is kind of awesome here. But Harry's full of Horcruxes and this world is ripe for the taking- he just has to prevent himself from going insane and becoming the next Dark Lord. Helpfully, he's regressed to a child.
