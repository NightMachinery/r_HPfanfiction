I like the idea of him postulating that there's a magical creature in existence that he is mocked mercilessly for. For arguments sake i'm going with Bowtruckles. He is furious that his ideas are mocked.

So he sets off on an epic quest to hunt down and study the Bowtruckles. In order to find them he decides to travel to America where the largest variety of magical creatures exist. Along the way he meets the two women (who have been cast as his sidekicks so far) and on his journey encounters many life-threatening animals. As he goes he keeps a journal of the creatures he meets and assigns them rankings of danger (including an awkward encounter with a nasty Kneazle that results in its XXXX rating). Newt can spend time wandering around America and meeting people who take care of these animals and learning about them.

I quite like the idea that until Newt wrote his book magical creatures were only known about by the experts so he can learn about them from these people and befriend them.

Along the way he discovers that there's a group of wizards capturing and exploiting some of the animals, lets say dragons, for nefarious purposes and of course being the hero that he is Newt and co set out to stop them. I also like the idea of one of his sidekicks dying but I don't know why. Have this be the end of the first movie, with Newt succeeding to defeat the people capturing dragons and the whole movie being quite light-hearted but getting a hint that there's something bigger looming when he finds a book/map detailing this groups activities.

The start of the second movie is Newt and his companions continuing on his journey. He still has the book/map from the first story and they decide to follow the organisations footsteps allowing him to leave America and travel round the world.

This group is then investigated and he finds out that the group isn't just after dragons, rather they are a worldwide smuggling organisation (and thus following them allows him to come into contact with more Beasts) and the dragons are being captured due to the discovery of the 12 uses of Dragons Blood. No. 7 being the most powerful. No.7 can do /insert plot device/ and is being gathered by this group for a Dark Wizard who intends to use it for /insert motive/.

You could very, very easily make this into Grindlewald and him needing the blood to make Inferi or to unlock some great power.

Then mid-way through third act of the second movie Albus Dumbledore appears and begins to help, they succeed in defeating the smugglers with Dumbledore's help and he leaves by the end of the second movie to return to Hogwarts, swearing to return when he is needed.

The third movie has Newt realising that he can't just carry on his merry way and ignore the situation back home. He travels to Europe to help the fight against Grindlewald. The wizarding world is now in all out war and they are loosing. Badly.

Now what I think would be really cool is if the third film could mimic WW2. We have Newt helping the fight and maybe they even manage to hold up and begin pushing Grindlewalds forces back with Newt becoming a respected, albeit very odd, leader in the war but Newt realises that they just aren't doing enough and can't possibly defeat him. Grindlewald has No.7, not as much as he would if not for the events of the first two films, but enough to make a difference. So Newt leaves, and everyone panics thinking he has abandoned them but bravely they decide to fight anyway /insert Neville-esk speech from sidekick/.

Of course Newt returns just as things start to fail, and with him are the many characters we grew to love over the first two films and with them the Fantastic Beasts they care about so much. They push the army back and things are looking up.

Of course Grindlewald can't be defeated so easily and demolishes anyone who comes near him.

Then Dumbledore shows up. Big duel, good guys win, Grindlewald in Nuremburg.

Then we can have a scene with Newt and Dumbledore chatting about life and Dumbledore can hint at his relationship with Grindlewald (not the main character, shouldn't be the focus). Picture the scene from the last Hobbit film (the only good one in it) with Gandalf and Bilbo. Then a Bowtruckle jumps onto his shoulder to eat a bug from his hair and cocks his head.

Then the epilogue flashforward can have Newt and his son sitting in the Leaky Caldron, Newt having told his son all about his adventures and how he got his journal published as the foremost magical creatures textbook. Then they overhear a girl being laughed at for talking about Nargles, Newt remarks that one day people said the same thing about the common Bowtruckle, they just didn't know how to attract them. Luna turns around and smiles.
