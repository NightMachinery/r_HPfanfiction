#+begin_quote
  Mr. and Mrs. Potter were not perfectly ordinary people. They did not live on an ordinary street like you or I. They did not have a small house with a number to differentiate it from the identical houses on either side of it. They had, in fact, quite the opposite of it all.----How different would the world of Harry Potter be if James and Lily had lived? Ships not listed because I'm unsure if there will be deviations from canon in that respect. Characters will be added as they appear.
