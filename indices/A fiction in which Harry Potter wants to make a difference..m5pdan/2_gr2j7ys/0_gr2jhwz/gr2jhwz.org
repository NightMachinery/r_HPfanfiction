  The last real thing Harry remembers is standing across from Voldemort and watching the killing curse fly at his face.Then he visited a fluffy white limbo that somewhat resembles King Cross Station and instead of choosing to move on or go back he does something else entirely.And wakes up in his cupboard on the morning of Dudley's eleventh birthday.Because that makes sense.(No. No it doesn't.)But Harry is going to roll with it anyway.
