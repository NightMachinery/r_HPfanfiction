Here's my master list of Fem!Harry/Hermione fics. Don't read any Harry/Ginny, so don't have anything for that, sorry.

 

*/[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13285012/1/][A Fair Life]]/* is one of my favorite ongoing stories. Reptilia28 Reaper challenge, Harry is told Hermione is his soulmate (as always in this type of story (I will note that this story DOES NOT have soul-bond type stuff in it...)) but this time has an answer for why he didn't get together with her. She doesn't swing that way. Reaper checks Harry's file, he is supposed to be a girl...

The story is (so far) about Fem!Harry Learning how Magic society works (and how it is different now that she is female) while going through the triwizard. Love the relationship between Harry and Hermione, doesn't just come on, there is some buildup. Very fluffy.

It has the standard Ron/Dumbledore bashing inherent in a Reptilia28 challenge fic(If your the type to dislike that sort of thing), but the relationship between Harleen and Hermione is wonderful. It just feels extremely nice to read their relationship.

(I know that you read this one, but keeping it on the list for other people.)

*/[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11197701/1/][Yule Ball Panic]]/* and it's (600,000 words of) sequels. I find the relationship between Fem!Harry and Hermione in it adorable. This one, once you get past the first story (which is entirely Fem!Harry slowly coming out to Hermione) is fairly fluffy, combined with a strong plot.
