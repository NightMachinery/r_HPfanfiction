#+begin_quote
  Lelouch thought his life over as the sword stabbed him. Instead, he woke up in a different world without his people, his power, and his money. Turning to the magic of this world to achieve his goals, Lelouch begins a crusade when the people he left behind are threatened. Even if it meant dying over and over again to achieve his goals.
