In the name of being inclusive we shall of course also have Hermione/Umbridge/Fudge as a paring the next day. And we better make her also have a BDSM lustful flinging with Dumbledore (cannon age) while we are at it! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

And of course, we can't forget all those awesome crossovers with GOT that have yet to be made with Hermione/Ramsay Bolton as paring! As soon as such a thing is invented I am sure that all the fandom's unfounded hate on that unlovable psychotic sadistic shall fall apart!🤞👍😁😂
