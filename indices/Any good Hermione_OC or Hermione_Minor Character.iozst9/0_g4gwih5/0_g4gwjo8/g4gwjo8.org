  Lists had never failed Hermione before. So when her feelings for Ron get out of hand, it's only natural for her to write a list to clear her mind. She would come up with a list of boys most objectively compatible with her, detail the reasons why, and choose someone from the list to serve as a distraction. Of course, she never dreamed that her notes would all magically get sent out. (Inspired by To All The Boys I've Loved Before)
