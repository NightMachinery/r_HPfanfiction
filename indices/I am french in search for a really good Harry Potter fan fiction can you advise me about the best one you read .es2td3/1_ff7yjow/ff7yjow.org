[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/285498][boy with a scar]] on ao3 is so good, independent one shots of what-if scenarios (like good dursley's, or no bwl).

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8045114/1/A-Marauder-s-Plan][marauders plan]] Where sirius comes back for harry at the end of 3rd year.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/879852/chapters/1692695][turn]] A drarry fanfic where harry gets a glimpse of a universe where Malfoy turned to their side (I'm not doing the story justice, it's amazing)

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10070079/1/The-Arithmancer][the arithmancer]] In which Hermione is a math genius, and starts on arithmancy and spell learning early on. A wonderful fic with a brilliant, yet still human, Hermione.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12473874/1/][Things in Common]] Where Ginny is sorted into slytherin, but doesn't remain the gryffindor type girl she does in other fics with this trope. It's similar to the Changeling that was recommended earlier, but her outlook on her family is much different.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]] Where Harry becomes a dark lord to fight discrimination that would harm Teddy, but without the bashing and super Harry

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6413108/1/][To Shape and Change]] In which Snape goes back in time to prepare Harry for what is coming next. It's a bit canon divergent, but very easy to follow and very heartfelt with a good strong plot

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7613196/1/][The Pureblood Pretense]] A female Harry goes to Hogwarts in disguise in order to achieve her dream of being a potions mistress. I'm not doing the story justice, the work is wonderfully done.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12783124/1/][Rewriting Destiny]] Hermione and Draco go back in time, but not as theirselves. Instead, they're reborn as siblings to those in the Marauders Generation as a way to bring about change. I'm probably explaining it more confusing than it is, the summary probably does a better job. But it's wonderful and well written.

I have so many more, so if you enjoy the ones I recommended, feel free to message me for more!!!
