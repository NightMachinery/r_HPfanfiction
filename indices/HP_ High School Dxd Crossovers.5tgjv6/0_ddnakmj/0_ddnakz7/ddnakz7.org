  Kuroka had thought she would fail. Her nine lives had been used up trying to save her sister, but it had all been futile. She had resigned to simply escaping, but out of the blue, a random man claiming to be a wizard appears, wielding powers beyond anything anyone had ever seen. With his help, she may just yet be able to save her sister, altering fate. The Master of Death comes.
