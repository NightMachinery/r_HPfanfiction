  Harry Evans is a perfectly normal sixteen year old, thank you very much. Except that... he isn't. Not by anyone's standards. (Not when he can make things move with his mind). He tries not to let it bother him, but he's doing increasingly freakish things, and the world around him is getting stranger and stranger. People are following him, and speaking in metaphors, and somehow knowing his name. It's unnerving.He wonders when his life became this much of a fever dream. Or... Harry Potter somehow slipped under the radar, and now, 5 years after that first Hogwarts letter was sent out, they've finally found him. The world is darker, and more hopeless, and the Harry Potter they get seems like the furthest thing from a beacon of light. He's angry and reckless and world worn. But he's their only hope: the saviour of the Wizarding World. If only he gave a shit.
