  The curse Voldemort cast on baby Harry had far-reaching effects on Harry's magic. Harry must now explore those effects, and magic itself, all while battling killer teachers, giant beasts, and more in a school that really needs a safety board. Luckily for Harry, he doesn't have to do this all alone. Harry/multi. Contains AU, OC characters, and more. Book One will cover first year and the events of the Philosopher's Stone.
