  Harry Potter wasn't stupid nor naive. He grew up having to look out for himself. Why would that suddenly change in the Wizarding World? But a snake in lion's clothing wouldn't reveal itself until it was to late to stop him. He wanted freedom, and he would get it. No matter what Dumbledore, the Ministry or Voldemort might think.
