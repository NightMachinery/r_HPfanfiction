  OoTP. Harry, Ron and Hermione realize that they're going to have to save their own lives - because no one else will. Turning to their own war plans, they create an inner circle and begin recruiting assassin, spies, ticking time bombs. A group of rag tag students will become an army. Can this give Harry the opening to defeat the Dark Lord? Inspired by Red Dawn.
