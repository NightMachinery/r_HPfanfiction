"It seems Potter really has gone nutters."

"What do you mean?"

"In Defense today he stood up and started screaming that our new Professor was just a giant chicken."

"Well that doesn't seem right. No one who takes that curse job is chicken."

"No not a coward, a clucking, pecking, egg laying chicken."

"You're having me on! Potter really did that?"

"He did. Then he got mad when no one believed him."

"What? Potter doesn't seem the type to get mad."

"Well aggiated more than mad, but he didn't like it when no one believed him."

"So what happened?"

"The Professor just stood there. Then once Potter finally stopped his ranting he tried to start class."

"He just ignored Potter?"

"Well he tried to. Turn out Potter cast a voice changing spell on him. Everything came out as clucks and tweets."

"Wow, how low can Potter sink. Bad enough he disrupts the first class of the new professor, but to do that to him. I can hardly believe it."

"I know right? Well what do you expect after last year eh?"

"What happened after that?"

"Well the class didn't take it to well. Granger, you know how that crazy bint it. She stunned Potter for disrupting class. Said she'd talk some sense into him later."

"Well damn. No kidding?"

"She is crazy man. You heard she almost broke Malfoy's nose a couple years ago with a haymaker didn't you?"

"Shit you are right? What happened with the class?"

"Well the Professor actually turned out to be brilliant. What he does is let everyone come up one at a time and try to figure out and break the spell. If you got it wrong you got a quick stinging hex and had to go to the back of the line."

"And? Who broke the spell?"

"Crabbe if you can believe it. Though the professor seemed surprised by his new baritone, so it might just be a change to the curse rather than a break."

"Damn, I wonder what else will happen this year. Kinda wish you had the Frenchies back though."

"What? You want a bunch of frogs back here?"

"Hey man, the men may have been shit, but the birds. The birds were wonderful."
