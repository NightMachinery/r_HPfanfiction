  Before the start of fifth year Dumbledore changes the plans. Unfortunately he didn't bother to inform Harry. At his trial, Harry realises that it is down to him to save his own skin. To do so his Slytherin side must come out to play, and once it's out it sticks around turning life at Hogwarts on its head. Warnings: EvilDumbles, SheepOrder/Staff, GoodGuysDontGetEverythingTheirWay

  Rewriting the rewrite to hopefully get over the writer's block. Harry feels there is more he can do with his life. He is not sure how. A night time visit from Kreacher helps him along his way. After OoTP: mostly stays in canon until the last few chapters. This is an Independent Frugal Harry.
