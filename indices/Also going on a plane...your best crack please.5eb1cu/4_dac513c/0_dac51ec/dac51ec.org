  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

  You could ask ten different people who Charles Potter is and why he does know things no one else does. You would get ten diffrent answers, one more unlikely then the other. No one of them knows the truth. He's the twin brother of Harry Potter, one of the boys-who-lived. He's a Slytherin, a genius and more often then not an insufferable asshole. And yes, he's being evil on purpose.
