I think these are the primary reasons for so many bash fics:

- JKR described the magical world as a horrible dystopia, once readers got past the 'fantastic' facade of the magic.
- Children's literature generally dumbed down adults. In HP's case it was mostly Dumbledore who got handed the idiot ball, so he got the most bashing as a result.
- Then shippers piled in and bashed those who blocked their favorite ships. This effort was led by Movie screenwriter Steve Kloves, who was an Emma fan and tried his best to push for a Harmony solution. I see the plethora of Ron/Ginny bash fics heavily influenced by Kloves' very biased writing.
- Finally, the stake of the war against Voldemort was extremely high. Voldemort winning and consolidating his power in Magical Britain would lead to deaths of thousands or even millions. They were fighting against a monstrous enemy who was a combination of medieval barbarism/sadism and Nazi nihilism (or in other words, an enemy far worse than Nazis and ISIS), and yet JKR wouldn't even let them use lethal force during the Final Battle. For example, the Trio already knocked out Greyback after he mutilated Lavender. Why didn't they follow up with a lethal strike to put that sadistic serial killer permanently out of business? We saw Greyback getting back up later, ready to torture, mutilate, and murder again. Many readers, including me, don't like that attitude AT ALL.
