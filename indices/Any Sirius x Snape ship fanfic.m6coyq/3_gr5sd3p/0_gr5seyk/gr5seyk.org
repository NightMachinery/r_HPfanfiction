  This is the sequel to a much shorter story also on this archive, Under the Influence. While it might be helpful to read that brief story first, it's not strictly necessary. This is really the story of how one deals with the aftermath of casual intimacy -- what happens when you want someone you hadn't expected to want, and then when what you want turns out to be. . . rather more.
