  Complete. Sick!Harry. Voldemort was defeated in Harry's 6th year. Now in his 7th year, Harry struggles with PTSD. However, surviving the killing curse resulted in more damage to Harry's body than anyone could have suspected. He develops an incurable, unknown form of cancer that only very dark magic can cause. How will everyone deal with it? Deathfic. Trio-centric.
